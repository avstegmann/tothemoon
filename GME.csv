Reasoning for Price Targets using comps:  BBY (Best Buy) currently trades at a market cap / revenue (12 months forward) of 26.25b / 47.45b = 0.55 price / sales.  Because:  1) GME uses a digital first, omni-channel approach  2) Will have positive free cash flows due to the high demand from XBOX/PS5  3) Has a digital revenue sharing agreement with $MSFT  4) Has data from 55 Power Up Rewards members they can sell and leverage for additional revenue streams  5) Has a new insider, our lord and savior, RC god bless, who took CHWY from ground up to now trade at a price to sales of well above 5  Then:  Taking a proprietary formula spoken to me in a dream by RC while Melvin was getting liquidated, I have arrived at a price / sales of 0.843 which is higher than best buy but much less than Chewy. Using analyst estimates for the 12 months forward revs (5.76b) and solving for share price, we get a fair value of  \~**69.69 per share**.  p / 5.76b = 0.8439  share price = p / shares outstanding (69.75m)  **Squeeze PT**   **RC** said on 12.15.20 ([13D Amendment Link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)) that he is ready to be our savior.  This was exactly 14 days ago as we head into a **new year**.

Also given how illiquid this stonk is it presumably takes very little capital to move it - imagine Melvin, in addition to the 10’s of millions of put positions they have, are also short 200 million dollars worth of GME. Knocking price down 10% will make their year over year look tens of millions better, &lt;1% of their fund but given how idiotic their management seems to be they need every % of performance they can artificially create  IMO the short raid was done yesterday to work around uptick rule, which went into effect yesterday at -10% and stays until eod today. That leaves one last shot 12/31 to smash this shit down. Idk if they do it at open or if they do it throughout the day, i bought these puts and will close some today depending on how yee yee yolo i feel.

Part of it could be a change in timeline, if GME lasts 5+ years rather than the 1-2 years shorts expected, that could be enough to change an investment thesis. Another is that regardless of timeline, shorts probably compare GME to Blockbuster and no matter how long, it's gonna be toast. So even though GME is undervalued right now they obviously do need a strategy for a long-term position in the gaming industry with games becoming more digital.   Maybe they create an E-sports gaming hub? Maybe they successfully transition to being an online gaming retailer with a new strategic partnership with Microsoft? With the promising 200+% online sales growth, there's a real chance the 2nd option could happen without a major change.   So to the GME shorts lurking, what would it take for y'all to change your thesis?  Also what're y'all gonna do if/when the comparison goes from Blockbuster to Netflix?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1753488|public|confidence|self|||What will it take to change GME shorts investment thesis?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn5d77/what_will_it_take_to_change_gme_shorts_investment/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

It seems like they would keep most of it invested so that it's being useful and making money.  The thing is as GME's price increases the amount of margin required to keep that short position is getting pretty huge.  If we assume they have to keep 130% of the shares value in margin, at a price point of $22 (about the highest it's gotten recently) that would take \~2 billion in margin to keep that position open.  Melvin Capital for instance has roughly 20 billion in positions on their 13F-HR.  Now this short position could be spread over a few people, but I think there's a reasonable chance it isn't.  Think about it, as it became clear that gme wasn't going away anyone with a smaller position would have unwound it because they knew melvin would be forced to keep it from mooning.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zhtia6axmc861.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=617f2455c4e8e07b96cd15d39faff17d8975e021|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1753471|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xf0LlyziTHrfPq7_7zEZk2j-S4y6xSj5O8Uzl5eEoUc.jpg|86.0|140.0|GME Shorts vs Hedge Fund Margin|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn56fn/gme_shorts_vs_hedge_fund_margin/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I'm here to tell you what has changed since then. Everything is in these two articles: [Bloomberg](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article), [The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article). Because you autists have the attention span of a chimpanzee, I'll give an executive summary.  1. **Juicy merger for super dank weed company**   On the 16th of December, Aphria and Tilray announced that they will merge to form the 2nd biggest exchange traded company of the cannabis market. They will form under Tilray's ticker, but Aphria stock owners will get a 62% stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38% stake. This will allow them to cut costs and get even stronger financials. The merger is expected to happen in the second quarter of 2021. 2. **Cannabis is still an attractive growth market**   A lot of people are sceptical for cannabis since the last few years the stock has jumped up and down a few times through cycles of hype and disillusion. This time, all the cards are laid out right. Aphria is based in Canada, Tilray in USA: North-America is getting addicted. Boomer orange man has obstructed the market, but Sleepy Joe loves his cannabis so we're good for atleast the next 4 years.    It's not just NA either, in the EU medicinal cannabis use and other legal CBD products are getting more and more popular, which implies an enormous growth opportunity. Tilray is already partnered with AB Inbev for CBD drinks and Aphria had acquired a sweet drink company (see last post) so they will fit together perfectly. Year after year, performance improves and astonishing growth rates can be found in financial reports (also see last post). 3. **Stock price is cheap, perfect time to get in**   I jumped in with that last post a bit prematurely (30 shares @ 8.74), the stock price has gone down more than 20% since then. This is because of [🌈🐻 bears that are shorting the cannabis market massively and losing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-short-sellers-now-down-155011384.html?),  $236.9 million total in short interest for APHA . It's time to beat them to the ground once again, like WSB is doing right now with GME.   Currently APHA is noted at around $7, [analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=apha) predict a median price target of $8.64 in the next year (+24%). None of the analysts are giving negative advice, it's all positive with most of them on a 'buy' advice. All of these advices are pretty conservative, weed stock is pretty volatile so the minute good news comes in through the merger or Biden administration you should expect big gains. I would project the price to reach 2017/2018 prices again if you guys diamond hand the fuck out of this stock.  **TL:DR** I'm passing you guys the boof on this massive gain opportunity. APHA is cheap atm and has good forecasts in the future with upcoming merger and Biden administration (+ worldwide growth opportunities). Let's reach another dimension with this stock.

And that makes sense, after all. If we simplify things by saying that 100% of outstanding shares have been shorted, that means we have roughly 200% long positions for GME, compared to outstanding shares. Add that to the list of ridiculous things about this stock...  If I'm interpreting this in a retarded, incorrect way, teach me the right way, because we're here to know... the way.  Anyway, if only 122% of those 200% long positions are held by institutions, that's basically 61%. Compared to Best Buy for example [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY)   or Target [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT) we're still a long ways off. I know, not the most relevant examples, but gaybears often cite those 2 companies as better places to go and buy gaming shit, so I figured why not compare them in this regard too.  Obviously, we could include Cohen's 13% into this calculation, even though he's technically an Insider. That does brings us a bit closer to the 2 examples above.  Either way, this begs the question. ***Ignoring all the other factors for the moment (I know, hard to ignore that 100% short interest...) how much more juice do we have left in this engine if this stock achieves, umm... respectable, 'established' percentage of institutional ownership?!***  Because, we all know, deep in our hearts, that despite all our efforts and meme energy, we don't have enough buying power to keep pumping the stock price up for the next 3-9 months.

Do you guys realize that GME is a dying company? I know there is a smart investor trying to take over it. But let's face it: not even with that this company has any chance. Gaming subscriptions is all going to be delivered over internet and subscription based.  You don't buy films anymore, you subscribe to Netflix. You don't buy music, you subscribe to Spotify.  Investing on GME on 2020 is like investing on Blockbuster of 2012.  And I also know that you are not investing on the company, but betting on a binary event because someone (somehow) convinced all of you that there will be a short squeeze happening on this stock?  I wonder if you realize what happens on a short squeeze? That is a  fast event where the price rises very fast and then it drops very fast again. So its the perfect definition of a pump&amp;dump.

Also there isn't any guarantees that the short squeeze will happen. Maybe it has even happened already.  Positions: I'm on the sidelines just watching this with fun. If the short squeeze happens in the end I will be ready to short this stock hard back to the floor again.

Yesterday, the gay bears fired a warning shot across our bow, and we ignored it. Our cash-colored glasses blinded us from seeing the true intent behind their perceived tomfoolery. We dropped our guard and became too comfortable with our gains and the positions we held with our hands of diamond. Our neglect to respond to that act gave them all the confidence they needed to launch a full out assault on GME Gang.  The result has been a true massacre. At exactly 0930 hours, Melvin Capital and their gay friends invaded our investment accounts and choked us with their girthy red bear dicks. We were unprepared for the attack, and, as a result, our army suffered mass casualties. We lost many of our brethren today. Men who had the best of intentions but the paper-iest of hands. Their tendies… lost to the ever-churning war machine.  The intent of the bears was not only to crush our spirits, but to offset some of their losses in order to regain the confidence of their boomer investors on their end-of-year report. This would, in turn, give them more ammunition to continue fighting this war.   But I have 5 words for those rainbow-dicked prostate smoochers over at Melvin:  The. Year. Isn’t. Over. Yet.  Yeah.

Next week it would make sense for them to de-risk those shorts and allow the stock to move up to 22 for the Jan 15 expiry since there's 11k open interest for 1/15 22 strike calls. IF they are successful in keeping the stock below $22 until January 15 it will take a lot more shorting, and an even greater squeeze potential. This could be a GME type situation by February.  If you want a little DD, they tripled their quarterly revenue year over year in their last earnings report, you can do the rest of your DD yourself  Some **position options**: **buy shares** 🚀🚀  **buy** Jan $22 **calls** with a break even of 22.60 (theta .03) 🚀🚀  Buy **covered calls** if you think they will be successful in holding the stock below $22 = **$20.15 average** shares cost (buy lots of 100 shares and sell Jan 15 22 calls) 🌈🚀  If you are super conservative (read: paper hands/building long term position) **sell cash secured puts** at $20 for a max gain of $75 per contract and a **$19.25 average cost of shares** if it drops 🌈🚀  Source: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/rkt](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rkt)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1751936|public|confidence|self|||MM's holding RKT to 20.75 = unsustainable 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmq73v/mms_holding_rkt_to_2075_unsustainable/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

And if you're unsure if you have a margin account or not, [by default](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/), you have a margin account. Keep options and whatever other not crazily shorted shit in your RH account, but for stuff like GME, why make it easy for Melvin?   So what can you do to screw over those greedy shorts who have manipulated GME for far too long? Either switch your Robinhood account to a cash account (but then no more instant deposits), or if you still want those instant deposits, move over your GME holdings to another broker like Fidelity or Schwab with a non-margin account.   Best of all, if you buy from some toilet paper hands on Robinhood that get scared off on days like today, then you're helping fortify the front line! Imagine if WSB can take another 1-2% of the float away from shorts!

This is more important.  **THE FINAL BATTLE OF 2020 AGAINST THE MELVIN CUCKS IS UPON US.**  Listen up and listen close.  GME dropped from $21 to a low of $18.who-gives-a-fuck today.   This was orchestrated by Melvin Capital. Tomorrow, they're going to try to do the same.  **On 12/31, they're going to try to drop this stock AS LOW AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.**  *But, uh, sir swanpenguin, why uh is this so important sir? Why do it now?* 🥺👉👈  Lemme fill you in on a little secret.  Melvin Capital wants to raise as much money as possible to try to survive the absolute disaster that is their GME short play. 2020 annual performance is CRITICAL to how much money they can raise.  **12/31 IS THE FINAL DAY OF 2020**   These motherfuckers are DROWNING. They will do everything they can to drop the price as low as possible by EOD 12/31. They will pull every dirty trick they can to manipulate this stock down into the fucking ground so this mess looks manageable (spoiler: it isn't) .  What does this mean for you?  This means the best damn buying opportunity of your life to get in on HISTORY. You won't see a lower stock price and you can bet your ass you'll be watching us 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌝 if you miss the ride.  Will we see $16 or below on 12/31? Probably not. $17-18 is fair game though.  **TL;DR: SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY ON GME SHARES 12/31 WHEN IT DIPS AND DON'T BE A 🧻🤏💩.

It's insanely undervalued.   &amp;#x200B;  From BBY last earnings call - “From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth,” stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry.   BBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65"" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers.   But analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR.   Here's what 4hour on BBY looks like right now:   https://preview.redd.it/telh37ss4z761.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9cbe2f91589dac3a165fd30cd40fdd8be4304ea  What the fuck do those yellow balls mean?

These stocks generally underperform the market due to their low risk, but their dividends are nice so people buy them. But while I would not hold the underlying shares, the calls in this do so well if you can time the play. And I think its just about time where utilities are primed to go off...like 10%.  Why the fuck would you want to buy something that goes up 10% when you all keep chasing 100% with GME or LAZR or some shit?  The call premiums are incredibly cheap on utilities, but the deltas and gammas are massive relative to the underlying premiums. That means that if the utilities rise even 5-10%, the underlying calls go up like 100% or more!   I think utilities are primed especially now since portfolios are being reallocated right now and into the beginning of the year. People use utilities as a safe investment since bonds suck and they can at least get some dividends from these companies. So there may be some asset reallocation into utilities in the coming days. Utilities also tend to go up like 5-10% within a short time and then consolidate for a long time and then gap up again (usually gaining like 10-15% a year). Technical voodoo shows that RSI is oversold for most utilities and MACD is alsoshowing a reversal in the trend. Short term, calls out a couple months is where I'm at (Feb/March calls).   Longer term, utilities are an interesting play with people buying more EVs, more things that need electricity, and interest rates staying low. What do interest rates have to do with anything? Well low interest rates mean utilities can borrow money cheaply for capital expenditures. And every utility company is heavily investing in solar and wind farms and other clean energy. Plus, the recent ITC extension by Congress in the stimulus means these utilities are going to ramp up their investments in clean energy even more. These investments mean cheaper energy generation and so less overhead costs etc and potentially more profit in the long run. For these reasons, I'm in NEE, AEP, AES, XEL, and SRE periodically for the long term (that is buy on big dips and buy during consolidation a couple months out for the GAINS!).

What I noticed is that they firstly bought 60k worth of shorts limiting the available amount from 100k to 40k. This is not a lot and we all know it! Since then they are actually trying to ease off a bit and have begun reducing their short shares amount. Between 9.30am and 10.30am the number actually increased from 40k to 60k!  So what does this mean? Well quite simply this is market manipulation at it's finest and IMO they're very scared and we're close to the endgame. We just need to trust our process and DD and not fold with paper hands. They are literally trying to shake trees and see if anything falls out. The fact that they are easing their position between 9.30am and 10.30am means they know it cant't go on forever.  My guess is they want their EOY results to be good and are just trying to make it to next year! My recommendation is to BTFD and I would honestly buy more if I had any more available funds.

This is the first DD I've posted here so please tell where I went full tard mode and fucked something up. If this breaks any rules I'm sorry and ill delete this post.   NuScale Power has developed smaller, safer, cheaper, and more affordable nuclear reactors. In December of 2016 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScales design of small module reactors (SMR's). NuScale was founded with the purpose of being able to construct next generation nuclear reactors in factories.  The major concern for nuclear power is safety. The 3 Mile Island incident, Chernobyl, and Fukushima all are severe push factors for communities to not invest billions in nuclear reactors. The last nuclear reactors was built in 2016, before that 1996. In 2019 there were 17 shutdown nuclear reactors in various stages of the expensive decommissioning process (this process can cost anywhere from 300 million to 5.6 billion).  NuScale has come to resuscitate the need for nuclear reactors in a new fashion. Development and research of commercial reactors has largely stopped. Traditional reactors, which cost 7 to 9 billion to produce, make 1 gigawatt of energy (enough to power roughly 1 million homes). However, NuScale has taken a new approach. Their SMR's take up 1% of the space of traditional reactors but only produce 60 million megawatts. However, for 3 billion NuScale can construct 12 SMR's side by side.  While in the commercial sector advancements for nuclear reactors has largely stopped, this is not true for the military. Since the 1960's the US Navy has sailed 1.7 million miles by nuclear powered ships without a single incident. France gets 75% of its power from nuclear reactors. NuScale represents the American response to commercial nuclear reactor advancements.  NuScale has improved the safety of their SMR's by removing pumps, valves, and various moving parts and at the same time adding more safety mechanisms to prevent a meltdown (even if one of us retards was in control). Furthermore, they plan to construct their SMR's in factories and ship them to where they need to be reducing the cost.  NuScale has spent 800 million, much of which comes from its main investor Fluor Corporation (FLR: NYSE). However, it also received 288 million from the Department of Energy to develop its designs. It also has its first customer in Idaho that wants NuScale to start construction on a reactor in 2023.  There are similar companies that are doing the same thing in Russia and China. America presses on to be the world leader compared to Russia and China, so this competition could lead to more investments into NuScale, especially from a pro near energy president such as Biden.  For no NuScale is private, but as Biden gets to set his climate change policies NuScale might look to go public to increase funding to expand. For now BHP is an investment that will flourish from not only nuclear energy expansion but also its various other mineral mining ventures.  This is probably too early to post as there is no talk of NuScale going public, but they are a company that I would keep an eye on over the years and invest in when they go public.

Stonks don't just ""go up"". They do technically go up, but this is not because of any qualities inherent to stock or shares. It is because of the collective psychological rally surrounding the stock market, the collective consciousness making a decision and people deciding that they are going to ride with it. It is no secret that emotions control the battlefield when everyone starts trading in those early hours of the morning. But what you may not be entirely aware of is that the stocks that succeed for you are succeeding because they HAVE to succeed. It is all just manifestation, and when a large enough proportion of the collective consciousness decides something is going to be a certain way, it's just going to be that way and you cannot fight it.  You can see this general principle of manifestation in action (and used for bad) when someone tries to pump and dump a stock. They get everyone to believe, and thus it becomes real. You also see it used for good when someone YOLOs their entire portfolio here. What they are doing is not actually risky. What they are doing is making a positive outcome necessary. Think of it as cornering your fate. When your fate has no other option, you are now in control of the path, no matter the odds.  I liken manifestation and magick thinking to something like hypnosis. Hypnosis works for people, but it doesn't work for everyone. The people hypnosis does NOT work for are the people who don't believe in it. The ironic side of manifestation is that everyone who thinks it's bullshit never reaps the benefits and gets themselves stuck in a negative feedback loop where nothing works out because they never think it will and so they never decide within themselves that things ARE going to work out simply because they ARE. If you decide that something is going to work, then it WILL. I can hear you know. You're saying ""Well I wanted the stock to go up but it didn't and I lost money blah blah blah"" and to that I would reply, if that stock HAD to go up for you, then you would have MADE it go up, so it didn't. When something HAS to happen, it's made to happen. When that stock failed for you, were you posting about it to build sentiment, were you creating a risk for yourself that made it a necessity for you, were you doing EVERYTHING you could to make it happen? Fortune favours the bold.  Lets bring this back around to GME. It is no secret that financial institutions have put themselves in a less-than-ideal situation with GameStop. Now I am going to admit, I don't totally understand how any of this works, but I do know one thing. It is only going to work if we, as a whole, will it into existence. Every DD posted, every piece of positive sentiment regarding the squeeze that is posted, all of this contributes to people buying more shares, increasing the personal stake of everyone involved. By sheer will of force GME IS going to squeeze, but the squeeze only exists if you believe in it and do what someone who believes in it would do (buy shares).  So here is my suggestion...  Understand that this squeeze IS happening, and that you are part of what is going to make it happen. Create a universe where it HAS to squeeze. Give yourself no other option. Hype people up to buy shares, do your own DD, press the limits of the risk-thresholds you've established psychologically. Put yourself in a position where the squeeze HAS to happen, and it will lead others to do the same. There will simply be too much universal energy commanding the squeeze for it NOT to happen.  See you on the battlefield.

But here is my DD, and how you can play in a role and profit with or without touching the stock.   You’re confused so let me speak your language 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀   GameStop offers PowerUp rewards membership.  There is a free tier, and $15 yearly membership tier.  Buy the $15 membership right now...you’ve lost more money than that in less than 15 seconds today...you’ve spent more money on that for lube and protection around your nearest Wendy’s.    #If every one of you with positions in GME actually did this, their profit numbers would look ridiculous at the next ER. If you spread this info to other people, many of whom are not aware, they may utilize it and ER would look even better.   So what does this $15 get you?  A $5 coupon every month that you can use on any item, including gift cards, and online gamin stores. Any of them...all of them  After 3 months you break even, after the 4th month you have a higher percentage gain than your RH account.   So you spend $15 for membership, and get $60 in the course of 12 months.   Your net profit is $45. If every month you pick up a $10 gaming card (PSN/XLive/ N eShop), you only end up paying $5 each month.   At the end of 12 months, you spent an actual $75, but ended up getting $120 worth of stuff.   Use it for yourself, or if you’re not a gamer, save them up and gift it to someone. Or give it to your wife’s boyfriend so he can use it while his dick is during the refractory period.  TL;DR:  Buy the $15 membership, it can and will help your GME positions...

Here are some ideas I would like to  have a discussion if it's feasible.  Here are things I feel GME could do to become a leader or disruptor in the current environment. Ultimately, the goal is that these strategies improve the customer experience, retention and loyalty and make GME $$$$.   1. Start a subscription box immediately. Leverage the GME user base and data. This would further benefit in a distribution centre future model.  If barkbox is a $1B business in subscription boxes, video games can easily do the same.  Think about all the avenues and options for a proper video game subscription boxes. Even if you dont want games, you could have a swag/figurines box, addons are easy here. Think of the different sub tiers, Used model subscription box, games under $40, or even a high end new release $80 monthly sub.  This is further improved if they have a gamestop membership or discounts on 12 year boxes vs month to month.  2. Develop an online gaming platform similar GOG/Steam for PC gaming. Why would they use this instead, well ideally they would get additional discounts from being a PowerUp member, which could make them competitive. What would be even cooler is if this platform somehow connected with both your xbox game pass or your ps network so you could play everything u wanted from the same platform on pc. This would benefit sony and microsoft if users got their memberships through gamestop, as it still adds to their userbase. GME would require an excellent value offer to take users away from established platforms imo.  3. Create a platform specifically for trading rare collectibles. Be both the middleman and vendor for the trade/selling of unique, rare and valuable collectibles, arcade machines etc... I feel like this is a niche that is quite hidden and needs a reputable leader to take the charge. Also could lead to a lot of good PR if there are rare sales that have taken place on a reputable platform. This is harder to execute logistically but could be worthwhile if they became an authority in collectibles; knowledgeable staff and experts are key here. Not sure how big this market really is. 4. Become the leader in tabletop gaming. Again reputable staff and expertise needed, maybe an acquisition like boardgamegeek. Here's a niche that could use a leader.  5. Sponsor/Host major e-sports events. (WoW's world first race was a good example recently of what they sponsored).  Gamestop should become an event broadcaster.  Okay well this i dont know the logistics behind this but it feels like in NA a reliable event broadcasting/streaming/distrubution host in gaming is lacking  - and moving to technology based future means this could be something to explore. Often times there is not a reliable backer to these things and this is where GME could step in. But major competitive esports, (league, ow, wow, cs:go, apex, fortnite etc..) there are plenty.  Pipe dream when they are ballin: SOMEHOW BECOME A MAJOR EVENT HOST LIKE IEM (INTEL EXTREME MASTERS).  6. If they cant host a major pro event then they should 100% try and host an annual NON-PRO competition. A large tournament for regular dudes to try and become the best at madden or halo or . They could stream and advertise the shit out of this thing. It could become a really huge event catered to people who actually shop at gamestop. This is fundamental in becoming a  cultural gaming hub and icon.  7. Improve their online presence and customer interaction. BECOME THE AUTHORITY IN GAMES AND SHOW IT. PARTNER WITH STREAMERS. REVIEW OR SPOTLIGHT GAMES, EARLY ACCESS, INTERVIEW DEVELOPERS. START A YOUTUBE CHANNEL, 24/7 TWITCH CHANNEL.  8. Partner with UBER or Doordash to get same day delivery guaranteed.

If you have shares this is a no brainer.   If you have options, well.... hold on to it or let it expiry worthless.   Why? Because the potential to make it back is far greater than the loss itself.  From my previous post, I had 25 x 135C for apple 🍎 exp 1/15.  Yes, I bought more.   I have been selling in increments of 5 and I sold the last batch right before they announced the apple car.   Why they did not do this during their “one more thing” event is beyond me. I knew I was going to get cucked by Timothy Cook.   So I sold every last bit and moved it into plays such as, GME and PLTR with the remaining amount I had left. I lost about 10 K total on Apple. My wife’s boyfriend is not happy.

Okay hear me out, I've been here a while. Just based on the fact that everyone here and their grandmother owns pltr, doesn’t that make anyone suspicious that either a rug pull is coming or that this thing is already fully valued at 40b after rising 300% from IPO? I don't think you guys spammed enough rocket emojis! Just gotta diamond hands this! MM trying to shake weak hands!  [So if we own the majority of the shares as shown ](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/ownership?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbol=PLTR)(80%). How tf is this thing supposed to moon if we are all bagholding at the same time? Especially at the year end when everything should be running out of steam.   There is no way everyone on this subreddit will be a winner. There would be so much gain porn it would be astronomical. Cramer and therefore the rest of wallstreet is probably plotting on how to crush us as we speak ;p  The other thing that gets me suspicious is all the people saying pltr 40 eoy. Why? Maybe some catalysts or some gay pennant TA. But really it’s because we got left out on the tsla train so we need to make our own hype train. Basically when the sub becomes so sure of itself in something like triple witching, PRPL mattress, MU, GME, NIO etc I know the bell is beginning to toll.  Every now and then the sub gets a prophet that the sub blindly follows and it ends deliciously(bad). MartyMoho, wellbespoke, dhsmatt2, VariationSeperate, Jackinthebox, vegasseller etc.   I'm in this 1/8 of my portfolio, ready to write off the loss at the end of the year, but you guys really have to temper your expectations and be realistic. We could moon, but when a ticker is memed large scale like this it usually ends in crushing defeat.

This one's a little different in that I'm entering sooner than I normally would, so I would starting small and averaging in.  BBBY is exhibiting a wedge pattern and is on the verge of breaking out. Normally, I would wait for a confirmed  breakout with volume before getting in, but BBBY reports earnings on 1/7/21, so it might be too late to get in with a good price due to earnings IV pump. For reference, BBBY beat its last earning projection, and I would expect it to do well this quarter too. It's found good support at the low $18's, so unless it drops way below that, it's a low risk play to get in now imho. As an added bonus, like our darling GME, BBBY has a decent short interest too, so an earnings smash has the possibility for a good old squeeze.  I would look for post 1/7 calls with relatively low IV. 2/19 is probably the earliest I would go for now, with March a safer choice. Price target is difficult since it hasn't broken out yet, but I would put a conservative $26 target, and over $30 on an earnings blowout.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1749197|public|confidence|self|||BBBY earnings and technical play|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klzobw/bbby_earnings_and_technical_play/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

As you all know, there are a lot of hedge funds on the opposote side, shorting the shit out of GME. As we all know, they were already short at USD 6, so they completely drowning now, that we hit USD 20.   On important thing to keep in mind, is that annual bonuses are extremely important for hedge funds and annual performance for 2020 will largely determine how much money they can raise for next year.  So in synopsis, these funds will do everything to keep the price level down until the end of the year! They will fight, manipulate and pull up every trick they now to keep that motherfucker down.  To all retards, which own stocks, that means you still have a couple of days to load up on stocks at the end of the trading day, when prices converge back to USD 20. My prediction is, that there will be a huge breakout in January, most likely after the conference or after christmas sales announcement.  For everyone, who worries about the recent price rise, keep in mind, that the company is still trading at 0.3x revenues, which is pretty much a distressed valuation.  My prediction is the following:  - min. USD 30 in January  - min. USD 40 after Q4 earnings - min. USD 60 at year end (roughly 1x revenues) - infinity after Cohen becomes the new CEO  Bless you|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1748863|public|confidence|self|||Importance of hedge fund year end performance for GME|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klwtne/importance_of_hedge_fund_year_end_performance_for/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

We are both juniors in college and have a shit ton of debt sitting on us, but we have been toying with the idea for a bit about getting married right after college.  Obviously, to do this I need money. I’ve been a safe investor and trader for around 3 years now, only buying ITM calls short term expiry and investing in blue chip stocks, but I’ve been following WSB for a bit now bc y’all are fuckin crazy and it makes my day watching some of the dumbass trades that somehow print bc stocks only go up not tits up (also, loss porn on here is 10/10). But I have come to an impasse.   I’ve thought long and hard about this in the past 3 minutes and have decided to leave the fate of my relationship up to WSB pumping the market. Instead of buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend, I’m going to buy $GME 50c 1/22/21 $22 and hope to God that it works. If it does, I buy the ring and have money to pay off debts and maybe rent for an apartment with what’s left over (I’m still in school so I currently don’t have a job). If it tanks, then my girlfriend dumps me for her husband bc no chick would stay with a broke dumbass who YOLOd life savings on a GameStop.  Help me WSB bulls, you’re my only hope.

He tried to figure out where the fuck in his apartment there was raw fish and that’s when he heard a snore. He looked to his left when he to his surprise saw a woman. “Oh dear, **what have I done!?**” Exclaimed Ryan loudly in disbelief.  &amp;#x200B;  **The day before:**  The three musketeers Ryan, Elon and Jack dumbfuck Ma had all planned to go to the new bar WSB to try and get laid before the new year. Jack had unfortunately been convicted for stealing Winnie the Pooh plushies and burning them on his roof. Needless to say, it was only Ryan and Elon that showed up. “Elon, it’s time.” Ryan opened the doors and instantly try were blinded by extreme RGB lighting. The so called bar looked more like a casino the more the two gentlemen looked around. And that was when they saw her. On the grandest of poles right in the center of roulette hall was the finest stripper Ryan and Elon had ever seen. The boys looked at each other and simultaneously started rushing towards the golden pole.  When Ryan had made it to the pole, the woman he had gazed at had started dressing and seemed ready to walk out. “Miss?” Ryan asked, who had made it first to her since Elon had stopped on the way to talk to some nerd about how he was planning on selling the moon. “And you are?” she asked, followed by a smile that triggered a huge blush on Ryan’s cheeks. It was at this moment that he knew what he had to do, he had to fuck her. “ My name is Ryan Cohen and I would be honored if I could bed you tonight miss?”. “Names Palantir. My shift just ended I have a room upstairs follow me” She took his hand and started leading him towards the edge of the hall. Thoughts were rushing through Ryan’s head like a rocket ship headed for the moon. He couldn’t understand how he had pulled this off. On the outside, she looked like the finest bitch he had ever seen.  &amp;#x200B;  **Fast forward to the morning after:**  Ryan woke up with his heart beating aggressively and sweat dripping like something terrible had just happened. He instantly ripped his iPhone 20X from his golden nightstand and pressed the familiar Robin Hood app. Fuck, fuck! he mumbled until the numbers loaded: GME shares were up 15% in pre-market. A sigh of relief went out, he sat there alone in his bed wondering what an absolute retard you would have to be to buy fuckin Palantir calls just to get an own on Warren maddafuckin Buffet who can die literally any day for being a fat fucking boomer!!!  **(TL:DR)**  **Instead, you could have invested in fucking a REAL business that you can barely understand instead of throwing money on something you DONT EVEN KNOW EXISTS LET ALONE WHAT THE FUCK IT DOES!!!!!!!

Key words for you nerds who can't read and have ADHD: **SPORTS BETTING**  It's already common knowledge sports betting is already big in the North American market - and will continue to generate tons of revenue as states continue to legalize sports betting. Canada is following suit. Legislations will be passed Q1 2021 and we're soon going to see an influx of CANADIAN online betting. **Basically all of Canada uses this app exclusively for sports.**  * 10M+ downloads on their sports media app with 4.7 stars on Google play store * \#1 sports app in Canada (#2 behind ESPN in the US) with 10% of Ontario's entire population that uses it * theScore successfully began the multi-state expansion of its mobile sportsbook, theScore Bet, launching in b**oth Colorado and Indiana in September** * theScore Bet secured market access to operate an **online casino in New Jersey via a multi-year agreement** with Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc. * Recently closed its bought deal offering yesterday, issuing 28.6mm shares at **$1.40/share** for gross proceeds of $40mm. * Total views of theScore esports’ video content across all platforms reached a new **all-time quarterly record of 292 million in Q4 F2020, year-over-year growth of 243%.** * Strong fucking balance sheet = increased flexibility for upfront investments in new markets (e.g., market access fees, infrastructure, etc.) * theScore is competitively advantaged in Canada, vs. foreign operators, as a homegrown player with a strong brand, which we believe will afford it preferential treatment by regulators with early market access, thus paving the way for early market share gains * theScore esports just recently has been named the **exclusive English language broadcast partner** for the **League of Legends’ Demacia Championship**, a marquee annual event featuring 24 of China’s top esports teams.  🚀 **Let's take a look at DKNG and PENN this year** 🚀  🚀 **Share prices for these companies have gone up 300% already this year alone, and with more legalization coming through 2021, theScore is just beginning to scratch the surface and will follow suit.**  🚀 **TIMING:** As vaccines begin to be distributed and the economy recovers, states are desperate for revenue and will be looking to ease regulations on sports betting. The more Sport games start promoting and reopening, the more these stocks will gain (especially with March Madness, NBA/NHL playoffs, etc.)  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  🚀 Listen - I'm literally handing you a platter of gold here. If you understand this market, the trends and where **actual revenues** can be generated - then you understand the play here. **Canada is UNTAPPED.** This thing will pick up steam soon and will graduate from TSX/OTC and can be easily listed on the NASDAQ. Once that happens, Robinhood will have access and the sky is the limit. I'm not here pumping a fucking non-revenue generating, fuelled by hype only, and a company within an industry that I don't fucking understand.  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **TLDR:** BUY AND GET IN NOW.  **Clearly, I'm on Interstellar's Endurance spaceship with TARS and CASE about to enter a wormhole that'll slingshot me into another galaxy... while most of you nerds are fighting to get on wooden sail boats. At the same time, I'm from the future telling Murphy Cooper (you nerds) how to find the tendies.**  **MURPHY'S LAW: WHATEVER CAN HAPPEN, WILL HAPPEN.**  **EDIT: FORGOT THESE** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  \++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1748394|public|confidence|self|||Is SCR the next DKNG?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klt51h/is_scr_the_next_dkng/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

Until now, Huawei was leeding the race to deploy 5G worldwide, but they are slowly getting banned from many western countires. As the FCC declaired:  *Both \[Huawei and ZTE\] have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus, and both companies are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the country’s intelligence services… We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure.”*   Huawei is loosing its market share and other companies will profit from it in the next couple years.   $NOK and $ERIC are both very well positioned to benefit from the 5G deveopments and Huawei's downfall, as both companies have already secured more than a hundred 5G contracts.

Back in February, some Chynese man thought it would be a good idea to fuck a Bat. This has since been regarded as a bad idea. The repercussions are known by now, and the market went down.  Sometime in March I got a call from 🍊, and he was all “Hey, JP, the market is going 📉 and the fact that it goes 📈 is my only redeeming thing about my Presidency. I need it to 📈 again.”  I was hesitant at first, but then he threatened to tickle me in my underwear. I hate when he does that.  So I turned my 🖨 on and started cranking. Of course having a fat stack of dollas wasn’t enough - I needed to do something with the money.  So I started buying shit behind the scenes, everyfuckingthing I could. I bought about 50 fucking PRPL mattresses, a shit ton of wood from LL, bought some fucking drones from [redacted], comped about 500 copies of GTAIV from GME and even put a downpayment on 15 houses using Z.  Sometime around late August, Trump called me Gay. I didn’t like that, so I returned my 8000 copies of “50,000 Shades of Gray” to AMZN and cancelled my order for 10,000 AAPL monitor stands. Sorry about that, sometimes stocks DO go down.  Anyway, it’s 12:30, i’m drunk and have a finger in my ass.

While a lot of it seems positive, employees seem dissatisfied with their management’s handlings of working hours and working under COVID guidelines. If GME is going to have sustained growth, things need to improve. We GME bulls think Cohen could help turn this around.   With that being said, I’ve read up on all the fruitful DD pertaining to GME and haven’t seen much about how Cohen/management want to improve working conditions for the staff. Could they possibly further consolidate brick and mortar locations to have employees do more specific jobs in given stores? I know they closed down around 1,000 stores, but I’m uncertain of if they hired those employees in their other stores. From what I can tell, Cohen has high hopes for GME financially in terms of it’s business model, but I haven’t seen much about it’s employees.   TL;DR: GameStop employees are passionate about their job, but working conditions (hours, schedules, and handlings of the virus) aren’t ideal. Does Cohen have a plan for this?

Reasoning for Price Targets using comps:  BBY (Best Buy) currently trades at a market cap / revenue (12 months forward) of 26.25b / 47.45b = 0.55 price / sales.  Because:  1) GME uses a digital first, omni-channel approach  2) Will have positive free cash flows due to the high demand from XBOX/PS5  3) Has a digital revenue sharing agreement with $MSFT  4) Has data from 55 Power Up Rewards members they can sell and leverage for additional revenue streams  5) Has a new insider, our lord and savior, RC god bless, who took CHWY from ground up to now trade at a price to sales of well above 5  Then:  Taking a proprietary formula spoken to me in a dream by RC while Melvin was getting liquidated, I have arrived at a price / sales of 0.843 which is higher than best buy but much less than Chewy. Using analyst estimates for the 12 months forward revs (5.76b) and solving for share price, we get a fair value of  \~**69.69 per share**.  p / 5.76b = 0.8439  share price = p / shares outstanding (69.75m)  **Squeeze PT**   **RC** said on 12.15.20 ([13D Amendment Link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)) that he is ready to be our savior.  This was exactly 14 days ago as we head into a **new year**.

Also given how illiquid this stonk is it presumably takes very little capital to move it - imagine Melvin, in addition to the 10’s of millions of put positions they have, are also short 200 million dollars worth of GME. Knocking price down 10% will make their year over year look tens of millions better, &lt;1% of their fund but given how idiotic their management seems to be they need every % of performance they can artificially create  IMO the short raid was done yesterday to work around uptick rule, which went into effect yesterday at -10% and stays until eod today. That leaves one last shot 12/31 to smash this shit down.

Part of it could be a change in timeline, if GME lasts 5+ years rather than the 1-2 years shorts expected, that could be enough to change an investment thesis. Another is that regardless of timeline, shorts probably compare GME to Blockbuster and no matter how long, it's gonna be toast. So even though GME is undervalued right now they obviously do need a strategy for a long-term position in the gaming industry with games becoming more digital.   Maybe they create an E-sports gaming hub? Maybe they successfully transition to being an online gaming retailer with a new strategic partnership with Microsoft? With the promising 200+% online sales growth, there's a real chance the 2nd option could happen without a major change.   So to the GME shorts lurking, what would it take for y'all to change your thesis?  Also what're y'all gonna do if/when the comparison goes from Blockbuster to Netflix?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1753488|public|confidence|self|||What will it take to change GME shorts investment thesis?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn5d77/what_will_it_take_to_change_gme_shorts_investment/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

It seems like they would keep most of it invested so that it's being useful and making money.  The thing is as GME's price increases the amount of margin required to keep that short position is getting pretty huge.  If we assume they have to keep 130% of the shares value in margin, at a price point of $22 (about the highest it's gotten recently) that would take \~2 billion in margin to keep that position open.  Melvin Capital for instance has roughly 20 billion in positions on their 13F-HR.  Now this short position could be spread over a few people, but I think there's a reasonable chance it isn't.  Think about it, as it became clear that gme wasn't going away anyone with a smaller position would have unwound it because they knew melvin would be forced to keep it from mooning.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zhtia6axmc861.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=617f2455c4e8e07b96cd15d39faff17d8975e021|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1753471|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xf0LlyziTHrfPq7_7zEZk2j-S4y6xSj5O8Uzl5eEoUc.jpg|86.0|140.0|GME Shorts vs Hedge Fund Margin|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn56fn/gme_shorts_vs_hedge_fund_margin/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I'm here to tell you what has changed since then. Everything is in these two articles: [Bloomberg](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article), [The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article). Because you autists have the attention span of a chimpanzee, I'll give an executive summary.  1. **Juicy merger for super dank weed company**   On the 16th of December, Aphria and Tilray announced that they will merge to form the 2nd biggest exchange traded company of the cannabis market. They will form under Tilray's ticker, but Aphria stock owners will get a 62% stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38% stake. This will allow them to cut costs and get even stronger financials. The merger is expected to happen in the second quarter of 2021. 2. **Cannabis is still an attractive growth market**   A lot of people are sceptical for cannabis since the last few years the stock has jumped up and down a few times through cycles of hype and disillusion. This time, all the cards are laid out right. Aphria is based in Canada, Tilray in USA: North-America is getting addicted. Boomer orange man has obstructed the market, but Sleepy Joe loves his cannabis so we're good for atleast the next 4 years.    It's not just NA either, in the EU medicinal cannabis use and other legal CBD products are getting more and more popular, which implies an enormous growth opportunity. Tilray is already partnered with AB Inbev for CBD drinks and Aphria had acquired a sweet drink company (see last post) so they will fit together perfectly. Year after year, performance improves and astonishing growth rates can be found in financial reports (also see last post). 3. **Stock price is cheap, perfect time to get in**   I jumped in with that last post a bit prematurely (30 shares @ 8.74), the stock price has gone down more than 20% since then. This is because of [🌈🐻 bears that are shorting the cannabis market massively and losing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-short-sellers-now-down-155011384.html?),  $236.9 million total in short interest for APHA . It's time to beat them to the ground once again, like WSB is doing right now with GME.   Currently APHA is noted at around $7, [analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=apha) predict a median price target of $8.64 in the next year (+24%). None of the analysts are giving negative advice, it's all positive with most of them on a 'buy' advice. All of these advices are pretty conservative, weed stock is pretty volatile so the minute good news comes in through the merger or Biden administration you should expect big gains. I would project the price to reach 2017/2018 prices again if you guys diamond hand the fuck out of this stock.  **TL:DR** I'm passing you guys the boof on this massive gain opportunity. APHA is cheap atm and has good forecasts in the future with upcoming merger and Biden administration (+ worldwide growth opportunities). Let's reach another dimension with this stock.

And that makes sense, after all. If we simplify things by saying that 100% of outstanding shares have been shorted, that means we have roughly 200% long positions for GME, compared to outstanding shares. Add that to the list of ridiculous things about this stock...  If I'm interpreting this in a retarded, incorrect way, teach me the right way, because we're here to know... the way.  Anyway, if only 122% of those 200% long positions are held by institutions, that's basically 61%. Compared to Best Buy for example [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY)   or Target [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT) we're still a long ways off. I know, not the most relevant examples, but gaybears often cite those 2 companies as better places to go and buy gaming shit, so I figured why not compare them in this regard too.  Obviously, we could include Cohen's 13% into this calculation, even though he's technically an Insider. That does brings us a bit closer to the 2 examples above.  Either way, this begs the question. ***Ignoring all the other factors for the moment (I know, hard to ignore that 100% short interest...) how much more juice do we have left in this engine if this stock achieves, umm... respectable, 'established' percentage of institutional ownership?!***  Because, we all know, deep in our hearts, that despite all our efforts and meme energy, we don't have enough buying power to keep pumping the stock price up for the next 3-9 months.

Do you guys realize that GME is a dying company? I know there is a smart investor trying to take over it. But let's face it: not even with that this company has any chance. Gaming subscriptions is all going to be delivered over internet and subscription based.  You don't buy films anymore, you subscribe to Netflix. You don't buy music, you subscribe to Spotify.  Investing on GME on 2020 is like investing on Blockbuster of 2012.  And I also know that you are not investing on the company, but betting on a binary event because someone (somehow) convinced all of you that there will be a short squeeze happening on this stock?  I wonder if you realize what happens on a short squeeze? That is a  fast event where the price rises very fast and then it drops very fast again. So its the perfect definition of a pump&amp;dump. Just look at the graph of WW on 2008:  [https://www.google.com/search?q=VOW.DE](https://www.google.com/search?q=VOW.DE) &lt;- Click on Max on the timeframe  You have to be quick to react to that if you want to leave with a profit instead of with a bag.  Also there isn't any guarantees that the short squeeze will happen. Maybe it has even happened already.  Positions: I'm on the sidelines just watching this with fun. If the short squeeze happens in the end I will be ready to short this stock hard back to the floor again. But in the meantime I won't risk being trapped by a fake short squeeze only to end holding the bag of a worthless company.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1752169|public|confidence|self|||Talking about pump&amp;dumps: starting to become tired of GME posts.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmsf27/talking_about_pumpdumps_starting_to_become_tired/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

Yesterday, the gay bears fired a warning shot across our bow, and we ignored it. Our cash-colored glasses blinded us from seeing the true intent behind their perceived tomfoolery. We dropped our guard and became too comfortable with our gains and the positions we held with our hands of diamond. Our neglect to respond to that act gave them all the confidence they needed to launch a full out assault on GME Gang.  The result has been a true massacre. At exactly 0930 hours, Melvin Capital and their gay friends invaded our investment accounts and choked us with their girthy red bear dicks. We were unprepared for the attack, and, as a result, our army suffered mass casualties. We lost many of our brethren today. Men who had the best of intentions but the paper-iest of hands. Their tendies… lost to the ever-churning war machine.  The intent of the bears was not only to crush our spirits, but to offset some of their losses in order to regain the confidence of their boomer investors on their end-of-year report. This would, in turn, give them more ammunition to continue fighting this war.   But I have 5 words for those rainbow-dicked prostate smoochers over at Melvin:  The. Year. Isn’t. Over. Yet.  Yeah. That’s right. Tomorrow is December 30th. December FUCKING 30th. Twenty MOTHERFUCKING TWENTY.  It’s time to remind them that we own &gt;5% of this fucking company, and we make the fucking rules.  Rally the troops. All of them. Theta gang. r/investing. Your fucking grandma. Everyone. Tonight we ride across the digital countryside like PAUL FUCKING REVERE and spread the gospel of u/DeepFuckingValue LIKE IT’S FUCKING COVID. Let every autist with a Robinhood account and boomer with a 401k alike know that THE SQUEEZE IS UPON US AND WE MUST BUY SHARES TO FULFILL THE DESTINY OF DADDY COHEN.  Let tomorrow be a day of reckoning for bears across the globe. Show them that the strength of our collective retardation knows no bounds.  Today, we are retards. Today, we are low-functioning autists. Today, we eat tendie scraps in the basement.  Tomorrow, we are the market makers. Tomorrow, we are our wife’s boyfriends. Tomorrow, we dine in VALHALLA.

So what can you do to screw over those greedy shorts who have manipulated GME for far too long? Either switch your Robinhood account to a cash account (but then no more instant deposits), or if you still want those instant deposits, move over your GME holdings to another broker like Fidelity or Schwab with a non-margin account.   Best of all, if you buy from some toilet paper hands on Robinhood that get scared off on days like today, then you're helping fortify the front line!

They will do everything they can to drop the price as low as possible by EOD 12/31. They will pull every dirty trick they can to manipulate this stock down into the fucking ground so this mess looks manageable (spoiler: it isn't) .  What does this mean for you?

It's insanely undervalued.   &amp;#x200B;  From BBY last earnings call - “From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth,” stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry.   BBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65"" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers.   But analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR.

These stocks generally underperform the market due to their low risk, but their dividends are nice so people buy them. But while I would not hold the underlying shares, the calls in this do so well if you can time the play. And I think its just about time where utilities are primed to go off...like 10%.  Why the fuck would you want to buy something that goes up 10% when you all keep chasing 100% with GME or LAZR or some shit?  The call premiums are incredibly cheap on utilities, but the deltas and gammas are massive relative to the underlying premiums. That means that if the utilities rise even 5-10%, the underlying calls go up like 100% or more!   I think utilities are primed especially now since portfolios are being reallocated right now and into the beginning of the year. People use utilities as a safe investment since bonds suck and they can at least get some dividends from these companies. So there may be some asset reallocation into utilities in the coming days. Utilities also tend to go up like 5-10% within a short time and then consolidate for a long time and then gap up again (usually gaining like 10-15% a year). Technical voodoo shows that RSI is oversold for most utilities and MACD is alsoshowing a reversal in the trend. Short term, calls out a couple months is where I'm at (Feb/March calls).   Longer term, utilities are an interesting play with people buying more EVs, more things that need electricity, and interest rates staying low. What do interest rates have to do with anything? Well low interest rates mean utilities can borrow money cheaply for capital expenditures. And every utility company is heavily investing in solar and wind farms and other clean energy. Plus, the recent ITC extension by Congress in the stimulus means these utilities are going to ramp up their investments in clean energy even more. These investments mean cheaper energy generation and so less overhead costs etc and potentially more profit in the long run. For these reasons, I'm in NEE, AEP, AES, XEL, and SRE periodically for the long term (that is buy on big dips and buy during consolidation a couple months out for the GAINS!).

What I noticed is that they firstly bought 60k worth of shorts limiting the available amount from 100k to 40k. This is not a lot and we all know it! Since then they are actually trying to ease off a bit and have begun reducing their short shares amount. Between 9.30am and 10.30am the number actually increased from 40k to 60k!  So what does this mean? Well quite simply this is market manipulation at it's finest and IMO they're very scared and we're close to the endgame. We just need to trust our process and DD and not fold with paper hands. They are literally trying to shake trees and see if anything falls out. The fact that they are easing their position between 9.30am and 10.30am means they know it cant't go on forever.  My guess is they want their EOY results to be good and are just trying to make it to next year! My recommendation is to BTFD and I would honestly buy more if I had any more available funds. Good luck everyone and keep your hands firmly on your shares.   💎🚀😎 GME GANG!!|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1751031|public|confidence|self|||GME Analysis of Shares Currently Being Shorted Today|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmgzp7/gme_analysis_of_shares_currently_being_shorted/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

This is the first DD I've posted here so please tell where I went full tard mode and fucked something up. If this breaks any rules I'm sorry and ill delete this post.   NuScale Power has developed smaller, safer, cheaper, and more affordable nuclear reactors. In December of 2016 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScales design of small module reactors (SMR's). NuScale was founded with the purpose of being able to construct next generation nuclear reactors in factories.  The major concern for nuclear power is safety. The 3 Mile Island incident, Chernobyl, and Fukushima all are severe push factors for communities to not invest billions in nuclear reactors. The last nuclear reactors was built in 2016, before that 1996. In 2019 there were 17 shutdown nuclear reactors in various stages of the expensive decommissioning process (this process can cost anywhere from 300 million to 5.6 billion).  NuScale has come to resuscitate the need for nuclear reactors in a new fashion. Development and research of commercial reactors has largely stopped. Traditional reactors, which cost 7 to 9 billion to produce, make 1 gigawatt of energy (enough to power roughly 1 million homes). However, NuScale has taken a new approach. Their SMR's take up 1% of the space of traditional reactors but only produce 60 million megawatts. However, for 3 billion NuScale can construct 12 SMR's side by side.  While in the commercial sector advancements for nuclear reactors has largely stopped, this is not true for the military. Since the 1960's the US Navy has sailed 1.7 million miles by nuclear powered ships without a single incident. France gets 75% of its power from nuclear reactors. NuScale represents the American response to commercial nuclear reactor advancements.  NuScale has improved the safety of their SMR's by removing pumps, valves, and various moving parts and at the same time adding more safety mechanisms to prevent a meltdown (even if one of us retards was in control). Furthermore, they plan to construct their SMR's in factories and ship them to where they need to be reducing the cost.  NuScale has spent 800 million, much of which comes from its main investor Fluor Corporation (FLR: NYSE). However, it also received 288 million from the Department of Energy to develop its designs. It also has its first customer in Idaho that wants NuScale to start construction on a reactor in 2023.  There are similar companies that are doing the same thing in Russia and China. America presses on to be the world leader compared to Russia and China, so this competition could lead to more investments into NuScale, especially from a pro near energy president such as Biden.  For no NuScale is private, but as Biden gets to set his climate change policies NuScale might look to go public to increase funding to expand. For now BHP is an investment that will flourish from not only nuclear energy expansion but also its various other mineral mining ventures.  This is probably too early to post as there is no talk of NuScale going public, but they are a company that I would keep an eye on over the years and invest in when they go public.

Stonks don't just ""go up"". They do technically go up, but this is not because of any qualities inherent to stock or shares. It is because of the collective psychological rally surrounding the stock market, the collective consciousness making a decision and people deciding that they are going to ride with it. It is no secret that emotions control the battlefield when everyone starts trading in those early hours of the morning. But what you may not be entirely aware of is that the stocks that succeed for you are succeeding because they HAVE to succeed. It is all just manifestation, and when a large enough proportion of the collective consciousness decides something is going to be a certain way, it's just going to be that way and you cannot fight it.  You can see this general principle of manifestation in action (and used for bad) when someone tries to pump and dump a stock. They get everyone to believe, and thus it becomes real. You also see it used for good when someone YOLOs their entire portfolio here. What they are doing is not actually risky. What they are doing is making a positive outcome necessary. Think of it as cornering your fate. When your fate has no other option, you are now in control of the path, no matter the odds.  I liken manifestation and magick thinking to something like hypnosis. Hypnosis works for people, but it doesn't work for everyone. The people hypnosis does NOT work for are the people who don't believe in it. The ironic side of manifestation is that everyone who thinks it's bullshit never reaps the benefits and gets themselves stuck in a negative feedback loop where nothing works out because they never think it will and so they never decide within themselves that things ARE going to work out simply because they ARE. If you decide that something is going to work, then it WILL. I can hear you know. You're saying ""Well I wanted the stock to go up but it didn't and I lost money blah blah blah"" and to that I would reply, if that stock HAD to go up for you, then you would have MADE it go up, so it didn't. When something HAS to happen, it's made to happen. When that stock failed for you, were you posting about it to build sentiment, were you creating a risk for yourself that made it a necessity for you, were you doing EVERYTHING you could to make it happen? Fortune favours the bold.  Lets bring this back around to GME. It is no secret that financial institutions have put themselves in a less-than-ideal situation with GameStop. Now I am going to admit, I don't totally understand how any of this works, but I do know one thing. It is only going to work if we, as a whole, will it into existence. Every DD posted, every piece of positive sentiment regarding the squeeze that is posted, all of this contributes to people buying more shares, increasing the personal stake of everyone involved. By sheer will of force GME IS going to squeeze, but the squeeze only exists if you believe in it and do what someone who believes in it would do (buy shares).  So here is my suggestion...  Understand that this squeeze IS happening, and that you are part of what is going to make it happen. Create a universe where it HAS to squeeze. Give yourself no other option. Hype people up to buy shares, do your own DD, press the limits of the risk-thresholds you've established psychologically. Put yourself in a position where the squeeze HAS to happen, and it will lead others to do the same. There will simply be too much universal energy commanding the squeeze for it NOT to happen.  See you on the battlefield.

But here is my DD, and how you can play in a role and profit with or without touching the stock.   You’re confused so let me speak your language 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀   GameStop offers PowerUp rewards membership.  There is a free tier, and $15 yearly membership tier.  Buy the $15 membership right now...you’ve lost more money than that in less than 15 seconds today...you’ve spent more money on that for lube and protection around your nearest Wendy’s.    #If every one of you with positions in GME actually did this, their profit numbers would look ridiculous at the next ER. If you spread this info to other people, many of whom are not aware, they may utilize it and ER would look even better.   So what does this $15 get you?  A $5 coupon every month that you can use on any item, including gift cards, and online gamin stores. Any of them...all of them  After 3 months you break even, after the 4th month you have a higher percentage gain than your RH account.   So you spend $15 for membership, and get $60 in the course of 12 months.   Your net profit is $45. If every month you pick up a $10 gaming card (PSN/XLive/ N eShop), you only end up paying $5 each month.   At the end of 12 months, you spent an actual $75, but ended up getting $120 worth of stuff.   Use it for yourself, or if you’re not a gamer, save them up and gift it to someone. Or give it to your wife’s boyfriend so he can use it while his dick is during the refractory period.  TL;DR:  Buy the $15 membership, it can and will help your GME positions...

Here are some ideas I would like to  have a discussion if it's feasible.  Here are things I feel GME could do to become a leader or disruptor in the current environment. Ultimately, the goal is that these strategies improve the customer experience, retention and loyalty and make GME $$$$.   1. Start a subscription box immediately. Leverage the GME user base and data. This would further benefit in a distribution centre future model.  If barkbox is a $1B business in subscription boxes, video games can easily do the same.  Think about all the avenues and options for a proper video game subscription boxes. Even if you dont want games, you could have a swag/figurines box, addons are easy here. Think of the different sub tiers, Used model subscription box, games under $40, or even a high end new release $80 monthly sub.  This is further improved if they have a gamestop membership or discounts on 12 year boxes vs month to month.  2. Develop an online gaming platform similar GOG/Steam for PC gaming. Why would they use this instead, well ideally they would get additional discounts from being a PowerUp member, which could make them competitive. What would be even cooler is if this platform somehow connected with both your xbox game pass or your ps network so you could play everything u wanted from the same platform on pc. This would benefit sony and microsoft if users got their memberships through gamestop, as it still adds to their userbase. GME would require an excellent value offer to take users away from established platforms imo.  3. Create a platform specifically for trading rare collectibles. Be both the middleman and vendor for the trade/selling of unique, rare and valuable collectibles, arcade machines etc... I feel like this is a niche that is quite hidden and needs a reputable leader to take the charge. Also could lead to a lot of good PR if there are rare sales that have taken place on a reputable platform. This is harder to execute logistically but could be worthwhile if they became an authority in collectibles; knowledgeable staff and experts are key here. Not sure how big this market really is. 4. Become the leader in tabletop gaming. Again reputable staff and expertise needed, maybe an acquisition like boardgamegeek. Here's a niche that could use a leader.  5. Sponsor/Host major e-sports events. (WoW's world first race was a good example recently of what they sponsored).  Gamestop should become an event broadcaster.  Okay well this i dont know the logistics behind this but it feels like in NA a reliable event broadcasting/streaming/distrubution host in gaming is lacking  - and moving to technology based future means this could be something to explore. Often times there is not a reliable backer to these things and this is where GME could step in. But major competitive esports, (league, ow, wow, cs:go, apex, fortnite etc..) there are plenty.  Pipe dream when they are ballin: SOMEHOW BECOME A MAJOR EVENT HOST LIKE IEM (INTEL EXTREME MASTERS).  6. If they cant host a major pro event then they should 100% try and host an annual NON-PRO competition. A large tournament for regular dudes to try and become the best at madden or halo or . They could stream and advertise the shit out of this thing. It could become a really huge event catered to people who actually shop at gamestop. This is fundamental in becoming a  cultural gaming hub and icon.  7. Improve their online presence and customer interaction. BECOME THE AUTHORITY IN GAMES AND SHOW IT. PARTNER WITH STREAMERS. REVIEW OR SPOTLIGHT GAMES, EARLY ACCESS, INTERVIEW DEVELOPERS. START A YOUTUBE CHANNEL, 24/7 TWITCH CHANNEL.  8. Partner with UBER or Doordash to get same day delivery guaranteed.

If you have shares this is a no brainer.   If you have options, well.... hold on to it or let it expiry worthless.   Why? Because the potential to make it back is far greater than the loss itself.  From my previous post, I had 25 x 135C for apple 🍎 exp 1/15.  Yes, I bought more.   I have been selling in increments of 5 and I sold the last batch right before they announced the apple car.   Why they did not do this during their “one more thing” event is beyond me. I knew I was going to get cucked by Timothy Cook.   So I sold every last bit and moved it into plays such as, GME and PLTR with the remaining amount I had left. I lost about 10 K total on Apple. My wife’s boyfriend is not happy.  Now had I held all my apple calls, not only would I have broken even. I would’ve been up. But that is in hindsight now.   The moral of the story is. Hold your shit and don’t be a pussy.

Okay hear me out, I've been here a while. Just based on the fact that everyone here and their grandmother owns pltr, doesn’t that make anyone suspicious that either a rug pull is coming or that this thing is already fully valued at 40b after rising 300% from IPO? I don't think you guys spammed enough rocket emojis! Just gotta diamond hands this! MM trying to shake weak hands!  [So if we own the majority of the shares as shown ](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/ownership?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbol=PLTR)(80%). How tf is this thing supposed to moon if we are all bagholding at the same time? Especially at the year end when everything should be running out of steam.   There is no way everyone on this subreddit will be a winner. There would be so much gain porn it would be astronomical. Cramer and therefore the rest of wallstreet is probably plotting on how to crush us as we speak ;p  The other thing that gets me suspicious is all the people saying pltr 40 eoy. Why? Maybe some catalysts or some gay pennant TA. But really it’s because we got left out on the tsla train so we need to make our own hype train. Basically when the sub becomes so sure of itself in something like triple witching, PRPL mattress, MU, GME, NIO etc I know the bell is beginning to toll.  Every now and then the sub gets a prophet that the sub blindly follows and it ends deliciously(bad).

We could moon, but when a ticker is memed large scale like this it usually ends in crushing defeat.

This one's a little different in that I'm entering sooner than I normally would, so I would starting small and averaging in.  BBBY is exhibiting a wedge pattern and is on the verge of breaking out. Normally, I would wait for a confirmed  breakout with volume before getting in, but BBBY reports earnings on 1/7/21, so it might be too late to get in with a good price due to earnings IV pump. For reference, BBBY beat its last earning projection, and I would expect it to do well this quarter too. It's found good support at the low $18's, so unless it drops way below that, it's a low risk play to get in now imho. As an added bonus, like our darling GME, BBBY has a decent short interest too, so an earnings smash has the possibility for a good old squeeze.  I would look for post 1/7 calls with relatively low IV. 2/19 is probably the earliest I would go for now, with March a safer choice. Price target is difficult since it hasn't broken out yet, but I would put a conservative $26 target, and over $30 on an earnings blowout.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1749197|public|confidence|self|||BBBY earnings and technical play|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klzobw/bbby_earnings_and_technical_play/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

As you all know, there are a lot of hedge funds on the opposote side, shorting the shit out of GME. As we all know, they were already short at USD 6, so they completely drowning now, that we hit USD 20.   On important thing to keep in mind, is that annual bonuses are extremely important for hedge funds and annual performance for 2020 will largely determine how much money they can raise for next year.  So in synopsis, these funds will do everything to keep the price level down until the end of the year! They will fight, manipulate and pull up every trick they now to keep that motherfucker down.  To all retards, which own stocks, that means you still have a couple of days to load up on stocks at the end of the trading day, when prices converge back to USD 20. My prediction is, that there will be a huge breakout in January, most likely after the conference or after christmas sales announcement.  For everyone, who worries about the recent price rise, keep in mind, that the company is still trading at 0.3x revenues, which is pretty much a distressed valuation.  My prediction is the following:  - min. USD 30 in January  - min. USD 40 after Q4 earnings - min. USD 60 at year end (roughly 1x revenues) - infinity after Cohen becomes the new CEO  Bless you|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1748863|public|confidence|self|||Importance of hedge fund year end performance for GME|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klwtne/importance_of_hedge_fund_year_end_performance_for/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I know this isn’t the sub for soppy stories, so Ill keep it short. I’ve been dating this girl since high school and I’ve known for a while that she’s the one I’m going to marry. We are both juniors in college and have a shit ton of debt sitting on us, but we have been toying with the idea for a bit about getting married right after college.  Obviously, to do this I need money. I’ve been a safe investor and trader for around 3 years now, only buying ITM calls short term expiry and investing in blue chip stocks, but I’ve been following WSB for a bit now bc y’all are fuckin crazy and it makes my day watching some of the dumbass trades that somehow print bc stocks only go up not tits up (also, loss porn on here is 10/10). But I have come to an impasse.   I’ve thought long and hard about this in the past 3 minutes and have decided to leave the fate of my relationship up to WSB pumping the market. Instead of buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend, I’m going to buy $GME 50c 1/22/21 $22 and hope to God that it works. If it does, I buy the ring and have money to pay off debts and maybe rent for an apartment with what’s left over (I’m still in school so I currently don’t have a job). If it tanks, then my girlfriend dumps me for her husband bc no chick would stay with a broke dumbass who YOLOd life savings on a GameStop.  Help me WSB bulls, you’re my only hope.

Ryan had just woken up in his bed when he realized he had the taste of raw fish in his mouth. He tried to figure out where the fuck in his apartment there was raw fish and that’s when he heard a snore. He looked to his left when he to his surprise saw a woman. “Oh dear, **what have I done!?**” Exclaimed Ryan loudly in disbelief.  &amp;#x200B;  **The day before:**  The three musketeers Ryan, Elon and Jack dumbfuck Ma had all planned to go to the new bar WSB to try and get laid before the new year. Jack had unfortunately been convicted for stealing Winnie the Pooh plushies and burning them on his roof. Needless to say, it was only Ryan and Elon that showed up. “Elon, it’s time.” Ryan opened the doors and instantly try were blinded by extreme RGB lighting. The so called bar looked more like a casino the more the two gentlemen looked around. And that was when they saw her. On the grandest of poles right in the center of roulette hall was the finest stripper Ryan and Elon had ever seen. The boys looked at each other and simultaneously started rushing towards the golden pole.  When Ryan had made it to the pole, the woman he had gazed at had started dressing and seemed ready to walk out. “Miss?” Ryan asked, who had made it first to her since Elon had stopped on the way to talk to some nerd about how he was planning on selling the moon. “And you are?” she asked, followed by a smile that triggered a huge blush on Ryan’s cheeks. It was at this moment that he knew what he had to do, he had to fuck her. “ My name is Ryan Cohen and I would be honored if I could bed you tonight miss?”. “Names Palantir. My shift just ended I have a room upstairs follow me” She took his hand and started leading him towards the edge of the hall. Thoughts were rushing through Ryan’s head like a rocket ship headed for the moon. He couldn’t understand how he had pulled this off. On the outside, she looked like the finest bitch he had ever seen.  &amp;#x200B;  **Fast forward to the morning after:**  Ryan woke up with his heart beating aggressively and sweat dripping like something terrible had just happened. He instantly ripped his iPhone 20X from his golden nightstand and pressed the familiar Robin Hood app. Fuck, fuck! he mumbled until the numbers loaded: GME shares were up 15% in pre-market. A sigh of relief went out, he sat there alone in his bed wondering what an absolute retard you would have to be to buy fuckin Palantir calls just to get an own on Warren maddafuckin Buffet who can die literally any day for being a fat fucking boomer!!!  **(TL:DR)**  **Instead, you could have invested in fucking a REAL business that you can barely understand instead of throwing money on something you DONT EVEN KNOW EXISTS LET ALONE WHAT THE FUCK IT DOES!!!!!!!

Until now, Huawei was leeding the race to deploy 5G worldwide, but they are slowly getting banned from many western countires. As the FCC declaired:  *Both \[Huawei and ZTE\] have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus, and both companies are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the country’s intelligence services… We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure.”*   Huawei is loosing its market share and other companies will profit from it in the next couple years.   $NOK and $ERIC are both very well positioned to benefit from the 5G deveopments and Huawei's downfall, as both companies have already secured more than a hundred 5G contracts.

Back in February, some Chynese man thought it would be a good idea to fuck a Bat. This has since been regarded as a bad idea. The repercussions are known by now, and the market went down.  Sometime in March I got a call from 🍊, and he was all “Hey, JP, the market is going 📉 and the fact that it goes 📈 is my only redeeming thing about my Presidency. I need it to 📈 again.”  I was hesitant at first, but then he threatened to tickle me in my underwear. I hate when he does that.  So I turned my 🖨 on and started cranking. Of course having a fat stack of dollas wasn’t enough - I needed to do something with the money.  So I started buying shit behind the scenes, everyfuckingthing I could. I bought about 50 fucking PRPL mattresses, a shit ton of wood from LL, bought some fucking drones from [redacted], comped about 500 copies of GTAIV from GME and even put a downpayment on 15 houses using Z.  Sometime around late August, Trump called me Gay. I didn’t like that, so I returned my 8000 copies of “50,000 Shades of Gray” to AMZN and cancelled my order for 10,000 AAPL monitor stands. Sorry about that, sometimes stocks DO go down.  Anyway, it’s 12:30, i’m drunk and have a finger in my ass.

While a lot of it seems positive, employees seem dissatisfied with their management’s handlings of working hours and working under COVID guidelines. If GME is going to have sustained growth, things need to improve. We GME bulls think Cohen could help turn this around.   With that being said, I’ve read up on all the fruitful DD pertaining to GME and haven’t seen much about how Cohen/management want to improve working conditions for the staff. Could they possibly further consolidate brick and mortar locations to have employees do more specific jobs in given stores? I know they closed down around 1,000 stores, but I’m uncertain of if they hired those employees in their other stores. From what I can tell, Cohen has high hopes for GME financially in terms of it’s business model, but I haven’t seen much about it’s employees.   TL;DR: GameStop employees are passionate about their job, but working conditions (hours, schedules, and handlings of the virus) aren’t ideal. Does Cohen have a plan for this?

Instead, I decided to do my own Technical Analysis on GME:  The chart below is the full history of the GME stock, you can clearly see that there is a lot of resistance around the $21-23 range *(I know its hard to tell because its messy but just try to follow along as best as you can*).   When we look at 2006, once it made a clear break of this $21-23 range, it shot up to $63.77. Especially in 2008-2012, there was a lot of consolidation around these price ranges but eventually did squeeze up to 57.70. Just to prove my point a bit deeper about this zone, around 2015-2016 prices finally came back down to the 21-23 range and guess what it did...**IT CONSOLIDATED IN THE $21-23 ZONE!** Once it broke that support, it took a pretty steep fall so in short... this 21-23 zone is a very strong zone to keep an eye out for.   [MAX YEAR-W GME](https://preview.redd.it/jjb80nq61u761.png?width=1574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f05b574464b81ac2fddadf862a9662468806d6d)  &amp;#x200B;  If you made it this far, I applaud you because now you have made it to the point where I explain how I'm playing GME this week.  &amp;#x200B;  Here is a 5d-15m chart of GME. On here you will see lots of lines and shit. These lines and shit have some meaning to it so just bear with me alright! If you already couldn't tell, these are my support and resistance zones. **The most important zone on here is going to be the purple zone which is $21.33-21.52** , which is also going to be my entry point if GME can make a clear break of that zone. Best way to put it, if it can clear $21.33, wE iS tO Da mOoN bABy 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  BUT HOLD YOUR FREAKING HORSES! if we fall below 20.02...we might be in for quite a steep drop as this $20 zone has been acting as a strong support level for the past week. If it makes a clean break of support, we'll probably fall back to $18.75...if it can't hold that? 15.80 again and we'll have to start this awful process all over again. I am extremely bullish on GME so I am not too worried that GME is going to fall under $20, but it is always good to have a back up plan, ya neva kno:/  [5D 15M](https://preview.redd.it/360ozr3d4u761.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db253aab5d46797a9b68b3ace6f85e4f554ea084)  &amp;#x200B;  To wrap this long and boring TA up.

They’ve been pushing us around for months. They’ve been manipulating the stock to put downward pressure in every way they can.   I got so fuckin tired of those using money/power to push little guys around, it compelled me to write my very first Reddit post about a move a bully made to push GME down. Shoutout to u/The_Bossss for spotting their next move too.  **But not every move of theirs sits in plain sight like this.**  * Ones who’ve been keeping an eye on the price action would know this but Oct/Nov: all those ‘sharp 5\~10% rise’ the first market hour followed by gradual decline throughout the day could have been them fucking with us. Let’s face it, we haven’t stood together back in those days the way we do now. I can feel it, we’ve grown stronger. We’ve almost gotten the Spartan’s ‘300’ shield formation down. Once we perfect it, GME will hit $300.     Think about it. After 20 days of you messaging your friends “oh shit GME is squeezing today!” you start to fall into “fuck it, I’m wrong again, GME will never squeeze.” Can you relate?  * It’s also VERY possible, that they are amongst us, selling us believable stories like “December 24th is going to squeeze because of A, B, and C.” and feed us believable bullshit to     A) to create disappointment again/take the steam out of us or    B) to scalp us on options (honestly these posts could also be written by just straight up scumbags amongst us for this purpose). Options that were $0.01 $0.02 a couple days prior as a result were $0.10, $0.15. Doesn’t seem like much but we’re talking easy 10 baggers and 7.5 baggers for these scalpers. * It is possible that they bought leading up to earnings/ran the price up, only to dump, to set the ‘direction.’ Yes missing revenue was missed by 9.73% and that’s not good, but when their earnings are beaten by 38.5%, did it really warrant almost a 20% slide the next day?      Similarly, they may have bought the past week only to cause a dip one of these days.       The moment you paperhand it, is the moment you accept defeat and let the bully have their way once again but honestly. STAND UP FOR YOURSELF FOR ONCE AND STAND YOUR FUCKING GROUND. Look around you, you got a whole gang of people on this sub alone that will never let it get so bad. Don’t turn your back and cry away just because you got bitchslapped. They are laughing at you as you walk to the corner to cry.      Remember, you have a whole gang of people that will never let it get worse than you can take it.    This is where your and my interest conflicts because I just deposited more funds and I’m hoping for a dip so whatever you do is fine by me.         **Don’t be fooled/read Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool articles likely paid off by Melvin Capital to be written that says GME may crash and burn or whatever because, on the contrary:**  * It is true that ICR now has GameStop under “Technology” now and it is true that Eli and Peyton Manning are doing a Q&amp;A at 5:30pm, which is just after Gamestop’s presentation. I really can’t see how Eli and Peyton are there for any other company but Gamestop.     I have a feeling they’re going to announce a development of light weight/portable/budget friendly Omni directional treadmill – look up OmniPad for example (these guys are working with Facebook now). I will talk about this in my Pt 4 DD but this is the future of gaming, e-sports even conferences/trade shows and even ZOOM calls (think room-like 'depth' so different conversations don't end up over-running each other). This would be HUGE.  * Hey maybe Eli and Peyton are not even there for Gamestop but guess what, at the very least, it’s enough to make Melvin Capital’s head start spinning wondering if they should trim their position just in case and trust me they’ve at the very least had internal conflict/dialogue about their GME short position there by now.    They can start closing any day now. My recommendation is that you don't try to time this. It can easily mean the difference between 10x baggers and 6x baggers.   * It could also be true that the ‘beef’ between Cohen and Sherman is not real. Look at the wording of the letters, look at the changes that Gamestop has been making over the past few months on their website alone. For all we know, it’s just to keep the shorts piling on. Sherman’s golden parachute could be the squeeze on the 2% Sherman holds. They could be working together. They (a different ‘they’) often do – and those who caught on to what I’m saying know that it’s not implied with any hate. I have family ties.  * It is true that all shorts are under water currently and they are paying fees/interest on their position (I know this is so obvious/repeated many times, sorry) * Ryan Cohen bought at $16.00. He’s not even sweating. You gotta wonder, how did he come to 12.9%? Is that his max? is that all he’s got? As u/ronoron pointed out, Cohen is not even fuckin sweating. He’s just trying to meme “OVER 9000” (holding 9,001,000 shares) * You also have to understand that in the world of high level execs/finance (and even politics), people all somehow know each other/are connected in a way. There is a criss cross web of connections. As much as they fuck us and swat at us like bugs, up there you can’t be so rash. Cohen can’t just come to the scene and instantly make the squeeze happen. He’ll make enemies that way. It has to be done in a way where he’s given so many warnings, given them so many exits along the way and made his intentions so clear all throughout.      Also, he’s Canadian so he’ll probably even say sorry as he makes the squeeze happens. Source: I am Canadian and I am sorry for the long DDs.      **Armed with this information:**  You guys are not all delicate snowflakes anymore. You guys are all carbon atoms. Some of you guys who can take some heat will make out as carbon fibre which I’ll still be proud of, but those who can take the real heat and real pressure will make out as diamonds.   Remember, the squeeze is a war and the moment we get the 300’s shield formation down. GME will see  $300s.        I will get to the boring math stuff one day of how I got to $103 minimum squeeze price and $326 on the upper end. You think my DDs are hard to follow, but fuck I know for sure I’m gonna lose you on the math. I talked a few percentages in DD pt1 and lost a lot of you guys. Seeing how you much stronger you guys have been lately/seeing movements around the put, I think it might even go higher but we’ll see.

Let’s do some half ass 🌈🐻 DD, maybe a bull can change my mind.  Facts of GME:   B&amp;M stores are dying and have been dying for quite some time.  Every video game in the very near future will be digital, thus putting less of a need for B&amp;M stores.  GME is the most shorted stock.  GME stock was at $5 prior to COVID and was on a crazy decline.  What changed since COVID hit, and bankruptcy for this company that makes it so valuable to autists.  There is no trade in value for digital games.  Where do people think GameStop will cover revenue that can’t be directly outsourced to a much better supplier such as MSFT, Sony, Best Buy and more.  GME is too much of a novelty and has continued to fail at adapting to the digital trend, aka which is was continued to kill this company and their terrible business model.  So with everything becoming digital, GME is no wear near Microsoft etc where all the same products can be purchased, with much better customer support, where does the value rest in this company.  Change my mind, I’m open to legit information, correct me if I’m wrong on any of this, until then   🌈🐻-out.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1746414|public|confidence|self|||GME 🌈🐻 Short position|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klb8ae/gme_short_position/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

Click to zoom in.](https://preview.redd.it/mtey1hnv7s761.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618569d9fbfb1e252c6cbd62736bcd17bc2100fd)  **Now then, the dissection:**  1. **The first chart shows the full 5 days and what is called the ""balance board"" the balance board is usually a heavily resistant and stubborn point that if broken, usually leads to a massive spike that may have short or long duration. As you can see within the last 5 trading days of last week (today is Sunday so new week) even with inflated retail, fomoing, and a squeeze, GME could not break the balance board, and in fact declined as attempts to continue to fail.** 2. Also on image 1 is the clear visual of when the rocket took off, Dec 22nd. That's the end of the flt lower line on Image 1 before the spike up.  3. Image 2 points out the drop later on that week, showing that the big firms, hedges, and other rich conglomerates that control a significant portion of the market where starting to pull and retail and other smaller conglomerates were losing the ability to pump up the stock, 4. Finally in image number 3, on Friday the last day of the week, the big firms, hedges, and rich conglomerates did not go in or pulled back leading to a crash, you can tell by the trajectory of the fall and the grey line (which is for after hours trading) that the amount of investment and pumping by retail and smaller conglomerates were not significantly less than before. 5. Expanding on point number 4 above, if you look at the after hours grey line, retail and others were still trying to push the stock up but because too much of the market controllers pulled back or/and stopped investing they were not able to not only keep up the pace from days before, but to bring back the GME stock into the green after hours.  **All the points above show that more big movers will pull or stall while retail and other smaller investor individuals and groups will lose the ability to move the stock higher**, it will keep crashing until some part of the bigger market movers jumps in to give a platform for all that retail pump to bounce off.  As you can see on chart 3 the trading activity of these individuals in groups did not drop, the only thing that dropped was big funding and big money either stalling or pulling the rug a bit. And look at how it crashed the stock, and how even with low volume during after hours retail still couldn't get the stock back up even back to the CLOSING LEVEL they failed.  We should prepare for a continuing crash on Monday and possibly a bigger major crash back into the low 10's or single digits later this week. Do not be fooled, no time has WSB continued a long fomo has it ever kept going up, there is no exception, get out and/or buy puts now. People were expecting the squeeze on Wednesday and Thursday, it came and couldn't break the balance board, and crashed on Friday. People are forgetting about Fridays crash and are hand waiving it as some temporary feet  ***But there are no fundamentals or technical analysis to support this stock moving past the balance board***, and with no big major cash movers to help retail or smaller conglomerates move the stock, they can't move the stock by themselves, this just isn't possible. All you are doing is wasting money at this point until more major movers go into the stock, or stalled ones start investing again.  Hopefully the breakdown, and stock charts above will finally help people understand why you can't float something without support, or launch something without gas. What is the balloon floating on? If there's nothing there the balloon can't float, this is common sense."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1746301|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rcSGb1ZO-2s36glGRYBAo6xjAgpVUoZxMjmlKhiXcy4.jpg|65.0|140.0|Why GME will continue crashing on Monday using Technical fundamentals.

This isn’t a sad story or anything just wanted to share my progress.   I’m 16 years old from the uk and i was fortunate enough to hop on the Tesla stock it’s done well for me so far I first invested 8th of September with my money I got for my school results from my parents it’s definitely one of the less valuable portfolios in this Reddit but it’s still a lot to me, I have actually made 100 pounds or roughly 130 dollars because I reinvested my money and bought a few tesla dips which was incredibly lucky I’m sure.  Ive managed to get my hands on more money and I’m thinking of buying Gamestop I’ve really been convinced that it will do well I can afford to buy up to 8 shares or so, I would really appreciate tips on my portfolio and how to expand, I’ve started to buy AMD and automation &amp; robotics in very small amounts and hoping to increase to a few shares of each by the end of 2021.  Yeah I’ve definitely been lucky so far, and I don’t want to stop being lucky if my money’s increase like this. Also I can’t do options because they arent available to do over here and I have no clue about them.

I might go over some points, but this is what I consider most important. Let's go.  &amp;#x200B;  ***Some of the facts:***  \- We're at the start of a new console cycle, which historically has always lead to a massive spike in share price. Even with the price surge in the last few months, we're still less than 1/6th of what GME was priced at last console cycle. And it's only just begun.  \- 250% of outstanding share float is shorted [(as of Dec. 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkjidv/short_of_float_update_gme_the_short_squeeze_is/) This means that there are more short positions than actually shares outstanding, which would create a problem for the shorters, should there be a catalyst that moves the price upwards, [creating a short squeeze.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)  \- Ryan Cohen, a 35 year old successful businessman, Billionaire, who self-admittedly only invests in companies he believes buys  a 9,98% stake in GameStop and has since increased it to 12,9%.  \- Ryan Cohen sends the BoD [a letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) where he tells them all how unhappy he is with how things are going and that they should get their shit together. This is done BEFORE he increases his stake to 12,9%  \- GameStop has its Q3 earnings which aren't great, but not as bad as projected, their online sales are up over 250% YTY and they have an additional $300 million in their cash reserve ($600 million for a company who's market cap currently is just over $1 Billion). [Link to Q3 Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)  \- We learn that they're closing 1000 stores which are hurting their profit by Q1 of 2021 and are doing some rebranding work. [Stores Shutdown](https://bestlifeonline.com/gamestop-closing/) and [Rebranding](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k66w5h/gme_rebranding_in_progress_theyve_just_changed/)  \- RC Ventures files another 13D on December 22 where he discloses how he increased his stake above 10% to 12,9% with another message for the board ***""While the reporting persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the issuer, the reporting persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.""*** [Link to 13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)  \- Investing research group Hedgeye pitches long-term potential for [GME with price target of ""$50+"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiv44e/gme_target_50/)  &amp;#x200B;  Now most of you should get a good idea why GME is a good bet short-term if you've read the above DD and do some logical thinking.

I, like many other people here, are planning to FOMO into GME on Monday. I really want to just dump all my money into GME shares, but I really just can't understand how this isn't a piece of shit company.  Hear me out, people are saying that Cohen wants to turn GME into ""the Amazon of video games"" but I just don't see how that could be the case. Amazon sells products that can be purchased from other online stores or retail locations. I can see the insane value Amazon brings to the table because I don't have to leave my house to buy anything I fucking want and it normally gets to me in a day or two. The problem with Gamestop, is that the vast majority of what they sell (video games) can literally already be purchased from my home via the Playstation/Xbox store and can be downloaded within a few hours. How are they providing any value to me as a consumer? Who the fuck even wants to buy the physical copy of video games anymore? There's a god damn digital only version of the PS5, how does gamestop make any money on this other than selling the console itself?  Also, pretty much every video game can already be purchased on Amazon if you really wanted the physical copy. Why would I stop taking advantage of my Amazon prime membership and use Gamestop instead? They would have to pull of some crazy ass shit to match Amazon's 1 day delivery.  Let me know what you retards think.

There is a new public post with the #BarkBox tag EVERY SINGLE MINUTE:  *Processing video ljf205se2m761...*  And this is only PUBLIC posts, where most Instagram posts are private. This explains how they grew to 1 million users so quickly. For you retards, let me draw this flywheel for you:  *Processing img agsz39sr2m761...*  To be clear, my investment thesis here is not that this company is not valued properly compared to the likes of CHWY. In fact:  * Chewy has an annual revenue of 7 Billion, BarkBox has estimated annual revenue of 370 Million, which is roughly 19x smaller than Chewy's.  * Chewy has a market cap of 43 Billion, BarkBox's is \~2.9 Billion as of Friday's closing price, which is roughly 15x smaller than Chewys.   So you can see BarkBox is valued slightly higher actually. However, what we have is BarkBox's growth rate based on the BB flywheel, I can see them hitting 2 million subscribers, 4 million subscribers in the upcoming years.   **Part 2 - Basic Bitches on RobinHood**  &amp;#x200B;  1. People love spoiling their dogs, the few basic bitches I know that own BarkBox, look forward to it every month. Don't you friggin love giving a good gift? They have immense positive emotions attached to BarkBox. 2. In 2020, almost every basic bitch has gotten Robinhood or Cash app this year and are trading stocks. 3. What do you think will happen once they find out they can actually buy their favorite $BARK stock?? Just look at the becky stocks. Right now they don't know about $STIC, I think once word gets out, they will jump on.      **My Position**  I basically invest in what's called the [u/SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/) ETF.

Having read and been entertained (and inspired) by some of you who have shared your stories I have decided to do the same to offer a slightly different perspective and I of course do not mean to criticize any other strategies. I actually thank all of you who have shared your gains and losses for our collective entertainment. The big losses especially always help to keep me grounded to a strategy of going after double and triples instead of only grand slams. In fact, quite the opposite and I'll have a few shout-outs that come to mind below.  **A Journey of Five Years to Seven Figures:**  I will keep things brief because I know only a fraction of the membership can read, and then another fraction within that grouping can read more than a few sentences, but I think it's crucial to draw a line in the sand when I really got serious with this goal as 2020 marks the first time I rolled over $1M.  I would say 2015 was the year when I started making what I would deem *good money*, at least in my eyes. A top priority of mine was to pay off all debt (minus a mortgage) and I achieved that. At the end of the year, though, I was lucky enough to be blessed with a CPA who explained something to me which has guided my investing ever since. **He explained how an IRA account works, the different types, and most importantly the fact that taxes are deferred. This is critical to understand if you're serious and I'll cover that below.** At first I thought I was misunderstanding him but long story short, I was not. While I would say that since starting my career I was hyper focused on my business I would also say I was equally focused on tax-minimizing strategies and when I learned about deferring gains until far into the future I was hooked!  At the very end of 2015 I opened my first two IRA accounts, a Roth IRA and a SEP IRA, and in the first quarter of 2016 I fully funded both to the max.  Candidly, while in life I'm fairly comfortable with risk (I gamble regularly, I ride a motorcycle, business risks, etc) I would say I'm more conservative on the investing side (relative to the degens I find here). The first few years of my investing was essentially comprised of maxing out my annual limits on any IRA I could open (those familiar with Roth and other types will know about AGI thresholds limiting what accounts can be contributed to or not) and utilizing index funds as a form of passive investing.  **Pro Tip #1: If you're not maxing out your IRA accounts annually if you can afford to you're retarded, period. And if you don't have any IRA accounts to invest in after reading this then you might be mega-fucking-retarded.**  At times I stupidly thought I'd ""time the market"" and I'm embarrassed to say that during this incredible bull market run we've been having since 2010-ish there were occasions where I'd move to cash because I didn't want to have any big drops. I've done a lot of reading on this topic since and I think this was a combo of stupidity first but also the age I was when the 2008/2009 crash happened and how it warped my perception of the stock market in general. Though I have had plenty of losing plays, particularly moments of gay beardom where I'd short companies, the bigger mistake was thinking I had even a slight ability to spot market highs and lows.  **Pro Tip #2: Basically 99.9% of** **~~gamblers~~** **investors have no real ability to consistently time the market.**  In 2018 I decided to take a more active role in my wealth accumulation and this is where my tax aversion strategies really paid off. Because I had been maxing out every IRA account I could get my hands on (eventually ended up with a SEP, Roth, and solo-401K) I had \~$200K of contributions through 2017 and once I threw in my full 2018 contributions I was off to the races! Now, not all of my money is in retirement accounts unfortunately and my strategies of plays are largely dependent on the account in which I'm making the play (meaning, plays that are short term in nature are made from retirement accounts and plays that are long term go through my non-retirement accounts).  **Pro Tip #3: The CV19 dip was probably a once in a century type of opportunity. I say this because it happened so fast AND it recovered so insanely fast and strong. Don't expect every year to be like 2020 for investing. Growth I had during CV19 was much more luck than skill.**  This year was exceptionally lucky for me, and for many others as we've seen, but in my case it was mostly due to the fact that much of money was in cash when Covid really hit in March. Not all of it, unfortunately, but because of my natural tendencies to want to focus on protecting against downside I do tend to have more in cash than most people on a percentage basis. That was beneficial to me this year, in past years not so much, but I think overall for the past several years I might be break even or possibly slightly ahead. But having cash on hand when the market tanked in March was extremely lucky without a doubt.  I would like to dedicate a brief paragraph to luck, a subject that comes up as a throw away a lot here but something that I don't think gets a full amount of appreciation. I have been lucky in life across the board, and in the areas of life that it counts most. In family, in relationships, in friendships, in business, through some close calls I've had on motorcycles, and countless other ways. Investing takes luck as well and that's just to be in the game. Lack of luck definitely happens in investing too so as far as my investing goes I don't attribute much of my growth to luck per se. Instead I would say that being lucky enough to have the support system of great people around me, which is all the luck I could ever ask for, provided me the strength to get through some losses and to have some moderate level of confidence as I started having some wins.  **Journey From Occasional Gay Bear, Frequent Degenerate, and Eventual Consistency:**  I was born a gay bear. By that I mean I am naturally untrusting and that goes for people, studies I read, data I see... you name it I'm skeptical. I believe a certain amount of this is healthy but in investing it's the kiss of death. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU ARE WRONG! By that I mean even if you spot a fraud (think NKLA, KODK, etc) the stock can still go up. Why?? BECAUSE STONKS ONLY GO UP, and amazingly that stupidity is actually true, who woulda thunk??!?!  When I became active with my investing I was lucky enough to get burned on some small shorting ideas that all failed to one degree or another. I say lucky because they were small and they happened at the start and so I was then able to learn my lesson and never do that again. Though I have not developed much of a strategy to brag about I can share some (probably obvious) things that have worked best for me:  1. As much as I can control myself to do so, I stay away from options. Frankly, I don't have enough conviction in most of my ideas to be willing to predict both the price and timing of how they'll perform. And I am too lazy to fully learn all of the intricacies needed to be consistent with options. 2. I don't consider myself particularly skilled at picking up trends so I prefer to place bets on more established mid-caps. Sometimes I think they're getting unjustifiably beat down, sometimes I think they have a bright future and/or the ability to outperform the general market. I do still have my degen moments and I can't help but play around with some smaller companies too.  **Why Taxes Matter With Investing:**  I've already written about this at length so I'd first suggest reading: [Tax Info to Cuck Uncle Sam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4phe2/tax_info_to_cuck_uncle_sam_so_simple_even_a_wsb/)  Myself and other members on here have also pointed this out ad nauseam and yet most of you fucking idiots are still investing in non-qualified Robinhood accounts BUT I WANT TO HELP AT LEAST A FEW PEOPLE. To make a long story short, if you intend on growing an investment account and not using it for your regular life expenses you are a fool if you're not doing this in a tax-advantaged way. I have seen at least a dozen people this year that have turned small sums into 7-figures and to do that within a tax advantaged environment means you would owe $0 this year in extra taxes. Even if you took $10k and turned it into $20K this year, which would be great by the way, then wouldn't it be greater NOT to owe taxes on that short-term gain??  If you're trading today because you need the money tomorrow then this doesn't apply but a lot of us are trading for fun, or to learn. If your job creates enough income to pay your bills then I think the smart move is to treat your investments as your retirement money when you have no income (beyond measly social security) so it only makes sense to lock it up today in exchange for tax breaks that will compound into huge savings down the road.  My strong strong strong suggestion would be to have both types of investing accounts, what are known as qualified and non-qualified (aka retirement and non-retirement) accounts. This will allow you to utilize qualified money for your short-term plays (less than 12 months) and your non-qualified money for your plays that are expected to last more than 12 months.  **Treating Investing Like Poker:**  I consider investing to be much like my experience with poker. Before CV19 I played occasional live tournaments and what I learned while doing that has been more important than the obvious stuff above.  * The importance of not getting knocked out. To win a tournament you have to be in the tournament and so a reckless strategy of frequent all-ins is not just risking your buy-in, it's risking your ability to remain in play. ICM is what I believe this formula is known as within the poker world. * If I win chips, you lose them. It is a very zero-sum game like that. We celebrate our fellow degens here on WSB as royalty among us but one man's victory is another man's defeat and I feel it is important to always be aware of this just for the sake of empathy. * The more people playing the bigger the prize pool. Anybody who has played in a poker tournament before has noticed that the more entrants the more the total prize pool grows. This seems to be the same with the market because the more appetite retail and institutional investors have to participate in the market the more companies want to go public to take advantage of that appetite. This means the winners win bigger, but interestingly, the losers don't lose bigger. IE unless you buy in more than once (which is why I don't risk going bust), a loser only loses one buy-in but the winner (or those that place in the Top 10) gets the benefit of all of those losers' buy-ins making up a bigger final score. * THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE: You don't have to win First Place to make money. In general you can place anywhere in the Top 10% and typically double your money, or better.  **Brief Catalogue of The Winners &amp; Losers:**  I place this last because I don't think it's very important but some of the tickers I did best on were JD, PDD, SQ, LUV, CHWY, CCL, PLTR, CRM and more recently I've been dabbling with SPACS. I'm also part of the GME gang now because of WSB and so far I couldn't be happier! The degen in me still awakens occasionally. I still hold some of those and that's not a complete list. My biggest losses came from shorting HLF and shares of NAT, CHK, and a few others I can't remember. Perhaps it's PTSD that I can't remember.  **My Final Reflection &amp; Perspective For Those Who Are Still Reading:**  More than anything else I'd like any reader of this post to realize that doubling or tripling your money is hard, but it's a lot easier than making 10X or 20X or 50X like some on here have been fortunate to do. **In fact, even doubling or tripling your money over a period of a few years is fucking hard!** I fear that people see a handful of individuals make 10X, 25X, 50X, etc and then think they're ""doing something wrong"" or feel inclined to take obscene risks in an attempt to duplicate that pattern and I frankly feel it's a fools errand. Admittedly I enjoy reading about those plays too, and I give props to those Gods of Investing who walk amongst us mortals, but I like watching high stakes poker and yet I realize that I am unlikely to ever be playing in those games because of my tolerance for risk. AND THAT IS OKAY! My goal is not to be a billionaire. My goal is to be happy in life and enjoy the company of those most important to me and that's what I was doing before I hit the 7-figure mark and that's what I'll be doing as I continue to (hopefully) grow my portfolio bigger. My main strategy as always will be to not lose money as much as possible and to happily take a 25-30% gain vs. always chasing the clouds.  To some honorable mentions:  [u/sir\_jacks\_a\_lot](https://www.reddit.com/u/sir_jacks_a_lot/) is one of the few geniuses on here trading in a retirement account and you should all want to be like him/her when you grow up for many reasons.

[u/poland\_spring10](https://www.reddit.com/u/poland_spring10/) reminded me just the other day that ""Scared Money Don't Make Money"" and while I am fine with being cautious it had been awhile since I had heard that and he/she was right and I needed that before 2021. [u/vitocorlene](https://www.reddit.com/u/vitocorlene/) for some excellent DD on MT and the steel industry in particular.  I wish I could remember who posted the techno cat and bongo meme yesterday because that shit was great too! And to so many of the rest of you whose screen names I can't remember now but who have shared huge gains, huge losses, and own the fact that you may end up holding huge bags on some of these autist meme stonks and don't give a shit about it anyway. I am jealous of those of you who can stomach going all-in on some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen and I sincerely applaud your willingness to go big or go home, especially those of using margin or loans which is just amazing to watch. I wish EVERYBODY a prosperous 2021. If 2020 was a good year for you I hope you keep it up.

They also have certain items they overloaded on that they need to clearance out that just sit in their stores that no one buys, also draining resources.  The time for this rocket launch for GME is over, because there are no actual fundamentals that show a bright future or any sort of turn around, there isn't enough to prop this stock up either, it will soon come crashing down once the decline starts and people run with their bags and escape.  With no TA or fundamentals or even a solid foundation under GS it can't move up much more than it already has and the only direction it will go in is DOWN.  &amp;#x200B;  [\(Blue line is where GME is now, Orange line is the support, which is much lower and diving, The orange bars starting to become higher than the blue bars on the bottom, represent the falling support overtaking gains.

I know a lot of people re uh, attached to GME after recent events and will dislike this, but recent WSB history and even longer WSB has shown it is foolish to keep fomoing on the stock after it's had multiple boosts, be smart it's not going to move up without any sort of massive spectacular news that will cause people to believe GME is on the rebound and that's not happening, at least not soon, and until then it will fall. Of course pointing out reality will piss off those waiting for the next jump while holding the bag and they'll put out fake hope so you can be fooled and help them get out while the downvote everyone else.  ***But simple DD will show you*** that it's time to prepare for GME to fall.

There is a new public post with the #BarkBox tag EVERY SINGLE MINUTE:  ![video](wnsg9b7i1l761)  &amp;#x200B;  And this is only PUBLIC posts, most Instagram posts are private. This explains how they grew to 1 million users so quickly. For you retards, let me draw this flywheel for you:  ![img](tj0g7udj1l761)  &amp;#x200B;  So to be clear, my investment thesis here is not that this company is not valued properly compared to the likes of CHWY or anything. In fact, Chewy has annual revenue of 7 Billion,  BarkBox has estimated annual revenue of 370 Million, which is roughly 19x smaller than Chewy's. Chewy has a market cap of 43 Billion, BarkBox's is \~2.9 Billion as of Friday's closing price, which is roughly 15x smaller than Chewys. So you can see BarkBox is valued slightly higher actually.  However, what we have is BarkBox's growth rate based on the flywheel, I can see them hitting 2 million subscribers, 4 million subscribers in the upcoming years.  &amp;#x200B;  # Part 2 - Basic Bitches on RobinHood  1. People love spoiling their dogs, the few basic bitches I know that own BarkBox, look forward to it every month. Don't you friggin love giving a good gift? They have immense positive emotions attached to BarkBox. 2. Almost every basic bitch has gotten Robinhood or Cash app this year and are trading stocks. 3. What do you think will happen once they find out they can actually buy their favorite $BARK stock?? Just look at the Becky stocks. Right now they don't know about $STIC, I think once word gets out, there will be frenzy buying.  # My Position  I basically invest in what's called the u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT ETF. I don't understand why some of y'all are giving him shit when all his picks have only gone up.  Yes I got lucky and got in just in time for the 25% run up (you would have too if you just bought after Sir Jack's DD post. But this is just the beginning.

Our savior, u/DeepFuckingValue, has shown us the light, and we must rejoice for him and his. Watch this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVscxs9oJg&amp;t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVscxs9oJg&amp;t=11s)) if you aren't familiar with the duality that is Roaring Kitty &amp; DFV. Smash that subscribe button and come back to reading (or ask a grown-up for help) these words.  As the semiliterate among you know, GameStop was scheduled to present on the last day of the ICR Conference (an investor conference for public &amp; private companies to show off how big their shlong is going to be when fully pumped) on January 13th, under the retail category. GameStop analyst extraordinaire (I won't speaketh the naughty Eeking Salpha words, mods) Justin Doperiala at DOMO Capital caught this minor, yet massive tweak.  At some point in the last few days, GameStop was shifted from the Retail &amp; Consumer category on the 13th to now present under the TECHNOLOGY category AH on Jan 11th. What does this mean? Management may not be-a-buncha-bitches after all. They clearly requested the category switch and have something TECHNOLOGY related to share. M&amp;A? Strategic shift/review? DIGITAL FIRST OMNI-CHANNEL?!?   Now, #WeWantCohen and there's really nothing the boomers can say to change that. But what they can do, is speak boomerish in a way that the other market participants are made aware of the tech &amp; e-commerce opportunity that has not been valued in any way by the market (yes, even at $20/share the stock is an easy 2-3x on fundamentals over 2021-2022). GameStop's tens of millions of unique customer profiles and decades deep dataset are truly unique in the massive gaming industry.  Melvin's put position was rolled to Jan21 (see pic), and management surely knows this. Could they be competent after all? Yes. This tells us they are dropping dongs. Now will Melvin bend over and take it? Doubtful. But don't believe the FUD. The upside opportunity and near term re-rating has been enhanced by Management's choice of the words TECHNOLOGY in this case.  TL;DR: DFV is the man. GME is going much higher. I have thousands of shares and hundreds of ITM/ATM/OTM calls from Apr21 to Jan2023.

Not sure if they will do a deal directly with Uncle Sam but if so that would be a potential catalyst.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1743783|public|confidence|self|||Gamestop GME documentary says vaccine will be delivered through stores, bullish if true|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkmnpk/gamestop_gme_documentary_says_vaccine_will_be/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'gVS8Rnkq_maQ7DnP08QVXPoZR5TtJhrQ4BN07w-fN4w', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Ppk1S9brIwWfGKKkttmbyEg4_lpKrLBj0kN4qH9UaB0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccaefd67d5ff9f30e7576457246ddb0271f391b9', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Ppk1S9brIwWfGKKkttmbyEg4_lpKrLBj0kN4qH9UaB0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6dc044d0045265e2353510d8b02cfa33067dd48', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Ppk1S9brIwWfGKKkttmbyEg4_lpKrLBj0kN4qH9UaB0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d4cdc07239cf84fdd27c257c64a929f324c0ef3', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Ppk1S9brIwWfGKKkttmbyEg4_lpKrLBj0kN4qH9UaB0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=860d5027aab25a8b6ff8315eead92664d54377bd', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||

TLDR: Gopro is now a software company with a product.  700k subscribers EOY. 2million EOY 2021 projection -  that’s $100 million of annual recurring revenue going into ‘22, before they even add any new subscribers and that’s at least 50% operating profit for the business.   85% of what’s being bought on gopro.com comes from the subscription. Users get a $50 discount when they buy the camera with the subscription. Current subscription cost is $4.99/month. Users get unlimited cloud storage, total camera replacement and up to 50% off at GoPro.com  “We’re going to launch a new updated version of the GoPro app. And it became clear to us that we should make the GoPro app available to people that don’t even own a GoPro and serve them through the app. It’s through software. And it’s a terrific opportunity for us to address a much larger TAM when you consider the number of people using smartphones compared to using GoPros.”  # BUY F’ING NOW.

After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $8.79.  * Sentiment: BULLISH * Option Type: TRADE * Trade Type: CALL * Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 * Strike Price: $15.00 * Volume: 250 * Open Interest: 179  **12/18**  Morgan Stanley Maintains Underweight on GoPro, Raises Price Target to $6.3  Morgan Stanley maintains GoPro with an Underweight and raises the price target from $4.8 to $6.3.  **12/3**  GoPro Says Subscriber Count Has Passed 670K; Expects To End Year With Over 700  ""GoPro.com performed as we expected, handily breaking sales records over the Black Friday – Cyber Monday period, thus ensuring we'll finish the year with well over 700,000 subscribers,"" said Nicholas Woodman, GoPro's founder and CEO. ""We are confident about our ability to exit 2020 with low channel inventory and a promising outlook for 2021.""  12/1 - GoPro, Inc. (GPRO) Management Presents at Wells Fargo 2020 Virtual TMT Summit Conference  “And the net result is higher margin, lower operating costs, better inventory management, better cash management, cash generation, and ultimately, a more profitable GoPro.”  “But I can speak for GoPros and we got comfortable with a shift to being more direct-to-consumer because we had good data as to consumers' propensity to buy directly from gopro.com. We’ve been growing our direct business year-over-year for quite some time.”  “And we’ve also made a fundamental shift in the value proposition at gopro.com. It’s not just, hey, HERO8 Black or flagship is available here. It’s also \[Technical Difficulty\] and if you are a GoPro subscriber, you can get it for $299 instead of $349; I am sorry, $449. So if you want to become a subscriber right now to get that deal, it’s $50 bucks. So your total basket price is $349 and you saved $100 over the $449 purchase price.”  “And we’re only going to offer more value to consumers over time through the GoPro subscription to help make it even more attractive, improve retention even further. It’s already really good. We’re really happy with it, but that’s something we’re going to continue to build upon. And so direct-to-consumer is an ongoing key initiative for GoPro as our subscription business. They go hand in hand.”  “We have about 85% of what’s being bought on gopro.com, whether it’s HERO9 or HERO8, 85% comes with the subscription, which is very high and we see very high retention rate particularly on annual. So it gives us some really good data and information plus the value proposition we’re offering that pushes us into 2021.”  “On our earnings call, we also talked about trying to reach up to 2 million subscribers in 2021. And given the growth in direct-to-consumer and the attach rate, we feel good about that number. And just to put it in perspective, at 2 million subscribers exiting ‘21, that’s $100 million of annual recurring revenue going into ‘22, before we even add any new subscribers. And to put it in financial perspective, that’s at least 50% operating profit for the business”  “And cash generation from this model has improved dramatically. You saw that in Q3, where we generated nearly $100 million of operating cash flow and we forecasted $225 million of cash in addition. So that’s another $80 million or so free cash flow and Q4 notwithstanding to convert, so the convert would be on top of that. So I think this model puts us in a really good position from an operating model and cash perspective, as we head into ‘21.”  We’re going to launch a new updated version of the GoPro app. And it became clear to us that we should make the GoPro app available to people that don’t even own a GoPro and serve them through the app. It’s through software. And it’s a terrific opportunity for us to address a much larger TAM when you consider the number of people using smartphones compared to using GoPros.

In April 2018 I started lurking on WSB.  I saw what you guys were doing, and truly admired your courage, but I knew you guys were just fucking around.  All in Apple weekly puts?  GME calls?  Again, you're there mentally but you're just not taking this seriously.  I have nothing against that, but personally I go hard.  The story begins in  July 2018.  I ran quite a bit of math and formed a plan.  I would use all my money to buy 5% ITM SPY calls expiring in 2 weeks.  When those calls were at expiry, I'd sell them and purchase new calls at the same strike (or slightly higher to cover the option premium).  The idea is over time as long as Spy kept going up I would eventually lower my risk and start paying less option premium, and eventually probably start buying monthlys.  For awhile this worked great, but one day stocks went down.  I lost everything because Trump said fuck China (fuck China btw), and decided to take a break while still trading a little.   I was sad, but I knew one day I would try again.  October 2019: After saving up for a year just in stocks, the second trial begins... this time with a new strategy: put spreads and leaps and oh my god were the returns fat, especially on the put spreads.  Put spreads provided some steady income while while the leaps were just plain good.  This is the strategy, and at one point I was pretty confident I was set  And then covid hit.  All my put spreads went ITM but I kept selling more into the drop thinking that the premiums were just too fat, but little did I understand what a pandemic was (even though my gay bear friend called me about the virus BEFORE the crash and told me to close positions.  Fucking legend, but blew all his profits on Macys puts lol).  My greed got the best of me, and even my leaps started going (quite deep) OTM.  At my lowest point I was down 40k from the peak.  I didn't close my positions, and the day trump announced stimulus really turned things around.  Even then, I did have to pay out a little bit on some of those final puts, but I still had like a few grand and my leaps.  I used the few grand to sell really ridiculous put spreads because like fuck it good premiums and my account is fucked anyways.  However, to my suprise stocks didn't go down after that... ever.    I made a profit of about 55k since the bottom of covid, and am now much less leveraged than I used to be (only about 3-4x now).  Over time I have moved out of selling options and I mostly trade futures now., but I still hold those leaps (Dec 2021 300s and Dec 2022 330s).  I also have a LOT of shares to insure my futures, which I know is gay but comon guys ever think about taxes?   You'll wish you did if you ever end up in my position.  The full story in image form is available in my last post.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1742652|public|confidence|self|||A Happy Ending|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkbifb/a_happy_ending/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I've seen pretty much all of them so hopefully you guys will make some suggestions too and I'll edit to add them.  # The classics  (I'm including those just so you won't spam the comments)  * **Wall Street** (and the shitty sequel) * **The Wolf of Wall Street** \- Yeah you've seen it 10 times while pretending to jack off to Margot Robbie when you were really thinking about Jonah Hill * **The Big Short** \- OG autistic action, I guess 🌈🐻s get a pass for this one  # Movies  * **Trading Places** \- What if WSB was around in the 80s? Two autist millionaires try to find out * **Rogue Trader** \- A retard who would feel right at home here manages a new trading desk with 0 oversight. I think we can all relate. Based on the real story of Nick Leeson (or is it 1ronyman?) which is worth a read, but watch the movie first or it'll spoil the ending. * **Boiler Room** \- Jesse Pinkman goes STONKS, BITCH and Vin Diesel doesn't blow shit up (except his clients accounts) * **Margin Call** \- Those suck right? It's like that but for a whole investment bank during the 2008 crisis. * **Barbarians at the Gates** \- Haven't seen this but it's about a guy trying to buy his own company. Probably a good watch for the week-end to get excited about incoming GME tendies  # Documentaries  * **Million dollar traders** \- They give random retards and a boomer a 2-week seminar and $1MM to trade, then proceed to manage them as loosely as possible. Somehow they don't all end up homeless. Can anyone become a trader? Apparently not a successful one, but you knew that already. * **Floored** \- Before RobinHood, retards had to congregate in a pit and scream orders at each other.

Pretty eye-opening on the practices of Chinese companies before they all stopped of course, now they're 100% legit trust me blo. * **Wall Street Warriors** \- Some are retards, some are autists, but somehow they all make money in finance, sometimes doing the stupidest shit.

It's kind of weird and Bri'ish and they fuck a lot, but it's all about people on the actual trading floor which is kinda cool. New this year so there's only like 8 episodes. * **Billions** \- I hesitate to put this here because it's more about politics and personal power-plays, but the main guy runs a hedge fund and a lot of the early seasons centers around that, plus he's rich and a dick about it so I automatically like him.

Just like GME I'm only getting started in Q4 of this year; as my positions clearly show I started right at the end of this week.   So this time of the year is the proper time to start new traditions, here's mine for this year. I'll post my stats for the year with the corresponding proof, laying out the highs and lows, talk shit about all those who doubted me or post some loss porn for you fuckers getting off to it.    This year doesn't have much to show since I've only recently been converted. But so far the last two months have gained over 17% which is nothing to the craisziness you retards post regularly, but it's enough to put a smile on my face!   I had started with 'optimally' levaraged ETFs and TSLA stocks (until my broker no longer offered levaraged TSLA long). I went full retard starting 30th of april and bought GME at the top for 19$, then went on to sell everything I could, maxed out my credit cards and left barely enough to pay the next rent into GME. This brought my average down to 17.02$ right before ER. I took out about 600$ to convert it into calls but the transaction still needs to go through.   So unless I manage to lose everything YOLOing it into something retarded I plan on upping this to at least 40k next year. I could pay off all debts and have 20k left to gamble in 2022.

It seems you've been making plays based off of /r/wallstreetbets top posts, but you always buy at the top and sell when it drops! You may have a intermediate case of the mysterious paper hands. Don't worry though, this holiday season can still be reversed if you've lost all of your gains to to $BABA weeklies, take a look below and allow me to introduce myself.   I'm dopydon, $GME trading mastermind, who can easily fix all of your horrendous day trades. There's a simple step by step solution to get you back on track, retard!  Step 1. Self diagnose yourself with paper hands, admitting you have a problem is the first part of finding a fix.   Step 2. Find a specific stock and stick to it. $GME offers a lot of upside with heavily researched DD, but your dumbass thought that about $PLTR and you still managed to fuck it up! Your dumb as hell! That's okay, things will be different this time, or so you tell yourself.   Step 3. Now that you have 200 GME shares, just wait. Literally do nothing. The money is free, and if you do this, not only can you get rid of paper hands, but you can starting to develop your trading prowess through diamond 💎 hands! That's a whole other post, stay tuned.   So you go out Monday, and put your whole $750 account into the stock, and I'll only be asking for a 75% helpers fee off of any of the monstrous gains you collect!

There are 70M shares outstanding and a short interest of 68M. Momentum slowed down a lot after Tuesday, but the price is holding above $20. These short positions were opened before the RC news, when the price was between $13 - $16. This means that unless the price falls back down below those levels, they'll have to pay a fine, which Is something like 20% + the price of buyback to hold the positions. But seeing as prices have been holding above $20 and news has all been positive since RC increased his stake, I don't see a nearly 50% drop happening soon. That's not to say they'll all cover, there were huge put orders right when the price started dropping, which could mean that institutions are trying to recoup losses through options.  **&lt;h2&gt;BUT&lt;/h2&gt;**  Even if 10% of those shares outstanding decided to cover next week, that's an additional 7M shares in demand. Recent volumes have been around 10M per day (not counting big news days). With almost a twice as many shares in demand as usual, we should expect to see some kind of pop. Maybe not a 300% short squeeze like,  but I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $25 next week.   Am I trying to hype myself up after being down 30% on 12/31 25c I bought at the ATH?

Whether that is with family or whether you are chasing another rocket high secretly in the backyard shed.  Short of the; GME TO THE MOON!!   **🚀**  \- which admittedly is retardedly funny, I do have some thoughts and questions you could potentially help me with. Bear with me as I take you on some quickly scanned background (optional) and the resulting thoughts/questions.   **Background**  I have been intrigued lately by the news around Gamestop (GME) and all of the commotion on WSB/Motley/Alpha. Thought the place might be Blockbuster-y junk at some point but maybe not?  * 5500 Locations. Succesful through 2016 when it starts hurting vs. Steam and Console Shops. Management unrest and changes 2018 forward.  * George Sherman (ex Best-buy) moving in and launching a re-org (Gamestop Reboot). Ryan Cohen moving up position to 13% and exerting management influence. * Focus on solidifying the core (selling poorly performing stores) and growing e-coverage (with some 800% YTY growth in Q2 2020).  From the Q3 2020 SEC Filing - comparisons Q3 2020 vs Q3 2019.  * Current assets down to 1.6bn (vs 1.8bn in Q3 2019). Total assets at 2.6bn (vs 3.1bn previously due to PPE drawndown). * Current liabilities sit at a steady 1.5bn (matches CA), with total liabilities at 2.2bn (down from 2.5bn, with long-term debt reduced from 420m to 216m).  * Retained earnings have taken a dive at 332m (vs 617m). * Net sales at 3bn (vs 4.2bn) previously, operating loss of 256m (vs 475m). There sits 25m of interest expense. Overall net loss is 295m (vs 490m). This includes 60m net PPE sales.  Market shows:  * Price August 2020 $5 rally to $20 now at 1.2bn market cap. * Of course, &gt;100% float with potential short squeeze (ie via Cohen, WSB retail buyers, etc.) * Positive impact new console launch  **Thoughts/questions**  I am strongly wondering whether:  \- GME will explode in a mess due to drawing down on their cash so hard. Still noting that likely they'd be able to attract more funding (ie via. bonds/lending/M&amp;A) - but we lose stock price/ownership in a Chapter 11-type of situation.  Or...  \- GME will be able to turn the ship around, make use of their client base and name, cut down on poorly performing stores, grow e-commerce.... then it will warrant a much higher market cap. And that doesn't even add the effect of short sellers desperately wanting to cover (the  **🚀** case!)  Really keen on hearing your thoughts/feedback!

Where did he get it?: I have no idea, hoping someone in the comments can tell us.  What's he saying?: I transcribed part using my shitty OCR app, there may be errors so it's better to read the screenshot but here you go because you're too lazy:  &gt;Right now there are some aggressive negotiations happening behind the scenes between several of the large short positions and some private equity / investment banks (PE/IBs) which will remain unnamed. The chatter going around is that the PE lb syndicate is offering two options. Option 1 is for the shorts to give highly discounted shares they hold of other stocks in exchange for shares of GME stock held by the PE lb side. This will allow the short positions to start to unwind their situation without getting completely destroyed having to source shares from the open market. Option 2 is to allow the large shorts to purchase tranches of GME from $35 to $80 in a private auction that will swap on an ATS and get reported over a series of weeks to minimize price impact.   &gt;However, things are not progressing well as the discussions have been going on for several months. So, Option 3 is the nuclear option and the reality of it occurring is increasing daily. A few of the head traders have indicated patience is waning and the short squeeze opportunity is just too good to pass up at this point.   &gt;And this is what brings us to Option 3. Option 3 is for PE/IB to suspend discussions with the shorts and begin accumulation. In fact, large quantities of Calls with strikes from $23 to $35 have been quietly accumulated via small lot buys in all expiry series out to 20 January 2023 and remain as open interest. Next step is analysts initiating new coverage on GameStop discussing how the company is turning things around post-COVID. ""Management closed the right stores and properly restructured. The remaining stores can act as micro-distribution centers with GameStop transitioning to a hybrid format e-commerce business. It appears they are taking the best of Amazon (online) and Best Buy (brick &amp; mortar). We see great things ahead for GameStop."" This is the narrative that will be launched at the right time to drive retail buying and to trigger passive management ETF buying. Then, PE/lBs will dive in with significant open market purchases to lock the float.

I believe in the company, and think they could make a comeback within the next year. I understand the whole Xbox and PS5 fiasco will gain them plentiful profits, and they are a main source of games for a lot of people without access to online stores and the like around the globe, but I have some doubts.   Cohen was a great pump. He raised moral regarding the stock and reinstated a lot of people’s faith in the company. If he were to do a full on hostile takeover this could go really, really well.   However, there are many alternative situations we could find ourselves in. What if he’s just being an evil cuck and plans to pump and dump this rally? What if he just decides he isn’t into the idea anymore and bails?   Furthermore, sure GameStops obvious next move is gaming e-commerce, but with Origin, Epic, Steam and more, there are already too many online gaming platforms at this point in my opinion. Perhaps they’ll mean to move into primarily shipping physical copies? Even then, why wouldn’t I simply order a game off Amazon?  Like I said, I’m all for GameStop as a stock, fuck a gay ass bear, and GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Basically I YOLOd into GME, which worked out yesterday but I fucked myself cause I ran out of day trades and actually went over the limit (Robinhood Account got restricted). With the profit I got from the over day trade tho I PUT BACK INTO GME into 12/24 $23 FDs and well we all know how that went today.   So not only did I go from $600 to $50 I now cannot even make trade until March. Now I have to move over to Webull BECAUSE they allow options without using a margin (don’t have enough to put in to activate margin on the other brokerages  which you need for Options).   TL;DR: I got too greedy, took profits and tried to make more with FDs. I’m a true retard and lost it all.

First some points to consider - I'm not going to explain them all because you are all intelligent enough:  -PC Gaming (how did this evolve)  -DVD/Blu Ray Sales (growth trends)  -XBox Game Pass  -Stadia  -Mobile Gaming  -Current Trends in YoY Physical/Digital Video Game Trends  -Cheaper Storage on devices (SSD, external drives etc...)  -Better Internet Service (starlink, fibre installations etc...)  -Facebook Marketplace/Kijiji/Craigslist -The Giants (Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart etc....)  -Chewy selling undigitiseable goods  -Ryan Cohen is a one hit wonder?  -Blockbuster  -HMV  The Short Squeeze Theory  If any catalyst was the short squeeze, its RC's increased position in GME. That generated 30% gains. If a 30% gain is not enough to trigger a short squeeze, then what is? This is the second 30% gain recently - I guess the Oct 8, Microsoft announcement was the first.   How does Gamestop have a rosy future,  where is its niche?   The only thing I can thing of that would be an epic play would be drone video game delivery. They have so many locations they can have a video game delivered by drone . A combination of super fast video game delivery and making a central video game console system à la steam is the only real way forward. Everything else is a distraction. Drones, Boardgames and video games hardware accessories might have a spot, however this would take a very motivated workforce.

I was pretty tired from a 4 hour hike and I really wanted to put it up earlier than later so more people would be exposed to it.  A lot of what I wanted to deliver got lost in the ‘Amazon vs GME’. I see it myself. Thank you to all that offered constructive criticism.  **If you still have any doubt that Gamestop is going back down to $16.00, I invite you to take a few minutes to read this as this would put the concern to rest. This DD is a bit longer, but I have never been more confident that this would put your concern to rest.**  Here we go:  **The Future of Gamestop/PowerUP**  **How many of you guys have one of these? Phones, GoPro, drones, VR gear, tablets, gimbal stabilizer?**        Of those who answered yes which would be everyone, how many of you did one of these with the old device when you upgraded?   A) Sold it on eBay and hoped to god every day you don’t get scammed until they could no longer open a case against you or pray USPS doesn’t lose the item or get delayed and have the buyer open a return/case as a result.   B) Sold it on Craigslist/Facebook/Kijiji and dealt with time wasters/low ballers/no-shows blowing up your phone which could only made you look popular in front of your crush only to finally have someone show up to offer you $50.00 less than your price which you clearly stated was a FIRM price because of a scratch you mentioned in the ad was ‘worse than they thought’ or that’s just all they had.  C) Gave it to a friend/relative/stash it in your drawer because you can’t be bothered with A or B  D) (Phones only) Don’t really love your friends/relatives as much as you love what you can do with the cash/they don’t want it more than you want the cash but don’t want to deal with A or B so you just took a lowball offer At&amp;T, Verizon…etc gave you which was easily $100\~200 below the fair market price?         **How many of you guys are ok with buying one of those devices used but you ultimately end up buying new because of:**   A) Getting scammed, buying a fake device/something being broken… etc etc   B) You can’t be bothered to deal with sellers who are not honest in their description.    C) The ideal unicorn seller is too far away.         **Can you relate? Of course you can.**  One day you buy a 1080P drone, next year they come out with 2.7K, next year they come out with 4K, year after that they come out with a 4K that fits in your pocket, and you can’t help but feel like you are just living in the past, or at least, left feeling like you are holding the bag like you bought PLTR at $29.   I have some of those devices, and I end up upgrading AT LEAST one of them every 1\~2.5 years just like you.      *  Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a place nearby that you can just go to get a fair value for your trade in (maybe $50 less than you could get online but you don’t have to waste any time)?  *  Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a brick and mortar place nearby you can count on that can’t just change their number/disappear tomorrow, have the ability to deliver your order to you in 1 hour AND offer returns AND offer 90 days warranty? What? I can buy extended warranty too?   * If there was one, and you just had to pay $50 on top of what you could find them for online otherwise, would you really bother with anything else? Would anyone?           **Don’t think about Gamestop for a second and be honest with yourself. If you answered yes to all 3, upvote this post. If you answered no to any of the above, just give it some time. You just haven’t experienced the inconvenience/pain yet.**   Ok, I get your point but there is no one that can offer something like this. Not **yet.**    Look, I know back in our days, Gamestop is where you went to get hustled but that’s going to change 180.’ Gamestop will change its name to “PowerUp” to be relevant in the broader consumer electronics field while retaining its gaming foundation.   So Ryan Cohen showed you guys that he’s serious about buying Gamestop upping his stake recently. It also said in 13D that he will do whatever is in the shareholders’ best interest. There was no new 13D posted today. **Meaning? The price rise was organic this week. Not from him buying. Shorts shook you a couple of times. You guys held. You guys did very good.**     Have you ever looked into what Chewy does in terms of customer service? Have you read up anything about Ryan Cohen to see what he/his father stands/stood for when it comes to customer experience? They are about selling goods that will make the customer the most happy not selling stuff that makes the most profit, funny enough, profit follows when you give customers what would make them the most happy and you end up making the most profit anyways. I speak from experience.   What made Bezos so successful is his focus on customer experience also. All entrepreneurs out there, please remember my spiel about customer experience at least. It’s the realest thing I or anyone can tell you. Do not ever fight with customers. Kill them with kindness if anything.    I bet you my last dollar this is what Cohen sees in Gamestop. The locations, the brand presence, 55M PowerUp members many of whom are already cultured on going through Gamestop’s revolving door because you get more store credit than cash and you are just accustomed to it.   **But c’mon man $50? How is the company going to make any money?** Look at the spread between bid and ask. It’s $50 each way from the mid-price (fair market price). That’s $100.00 profit for the company.   Still, only $100.00? Yeah, that’s actually 2X what they make off of console sales.   Every one of you, I know you said yes to my questions above, so do the math, upgrading at least one of the devices every 1\~2.5 years. Under this vision, it will be like 10 new consoles are being released every year for Gamestop AT LEAST. It will AT LEAST outdo BestBuy 26.55B market cap. Meaning Gamestop will do at least 20X within the next 5\~10 years.   **“Yeah but Amazon sells used too? Didn’t you see?”**  Not like this. Used items on Amazon is more like buying stuff on eBay. Often relying on the seller’s description and the seller’s shipping. Can you drop your item off to Amazon and get cash? No  Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   Then, after you bought the device, they just do this 1 simple thing.    1 week after you bought the thing they send you a text         *“Hey Autist, just wanted to check in, how’s your new dildo flexing so far? It’s gwon? Iight, good to hear. We are here if you have any questions/concerns. Have a nice day”*  Cohen will do at least this. I guarantee you, except he will add some more personal/relatable touch like “the 4K 69 Mega Pixel camera on that bitch really is something else huh?” As a cherry on top, there it is, one thing we can’t mistake as anything else. A FUCKIN ROCKET EMOJI at the end of the message. Wouldn’t you feel loved?  🚀   **Oh yeah, add this to the books.**      With millions of us retail WSB autists holding GME, think about what that does for the PR when the squeeze happens and it WILL HAPPEN because $16 is where all the shorts are under water, and we ARE NEVER going below that. They’re paying fees right now and they will eventually cover.   Good chance the squeeze will happen like Tesla’s, 4X ing+ over a couple of months as they start to prove their vision and show that they are there to stay. (Source A). This is how it typically squeezes against diamond hands, diamond balls institutional shorts. 10X ing++++ as they bring their vision to reality.   &amp;#x200B;  [See October 19 to Feb 20](https://preview.redd.it/zag3ukfz57761.jpg?width=959&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0b9ad0b7878c5f6fd49829d2fe16e719320ee4)  That is, of course unless Cohen was just waiting for the new year for tax purposes to announce that “oh yeah guys, I actually have enough options, shares now to buy the company”    He rides the squeeze, sell 25% shares, profit from that alone will pay for the business acquisition when it comes back down to its value as it is today of around $0. The positive profit they would MOST CERTAINLY generate from this console cycle will more than pay for the restructuring. He still remains a major shareholder with 25%. His best interest will always be scaling GME. Sherman for example, he owns 2% Bezos owns a little over 10%  **Do you want to think really long term?**   YouTube knew from Day 1 they were going to put ads one day, but they wanted to make it as sweet as possible for it to be engrained in you first – think video, think Youtube.          The day will come, think upgrading your device, whether it is new or used, think **PowerUP (more suitable name than Gamestop while retaining the gaming image)**     My point is, that they can increase the $100 spread if they wanted to if you are still so hung up on making only $100/device when I could easily run around myself as a nobody with no store, no reputation and flip 20 devices/week. Try it. Consumer electronics is SUPER LIQUID.             How about this? When you bring your trade in, you get only $50 less than the classifieds’ resale value when you take store credit, but if you want cash, we can only give you $75 less than the classifieds’ resale value      There, I just made the spread 50% more, $150 profit/device for Gamestop, and I made you more likely to return. Happy?   Bezos knew he wasn’t going to sell just books down the road.   Elon Musk knew he wasn’t signing up to build just cars.    Successful business people like Ryan can anticipate moves years down the road.   The sky is the limit.  **We are just at the beginning, and I'm not done yet.**    **You think I'm out to lunch? They're already getting started (as mentioned in Pt2 of my DD). If you really can't relate, it's ok, it's probably because you are deep in #1 (as mentioned in Pt1 of my DD)**   My position:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.   P.S :        Ryan, if you are reading this. I know you see the picture because it's the obvious picture. I’m in the space, and you’re right on the money in regards to the things you preach and do in regards to customer service/customer experience.    I got some ideas I can offer from writing these DDs, I see where you can save in shipping, how the listing ‘system’ should be so all employees can take pictures and describe the items with consistency like how all McDonalds employees can make burgers with consistency… etc etc just to start.

I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.  You see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff ""the bald Grinch"" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.  https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China  The previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html  But like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.  So he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.  https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power  So what happens?  Buy the dip??  Cut losses and run???  Answer is simple:  If you are holding stocks then just keep holding it. BABA isn't going anywhere, they are the ecommerce monopoly along with Tencent in almost the entire Asia. The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.  Recover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.  I have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work. So until there is a clear winner in the power struggle, I am not gonna be a bad retard. If you want to listen, cool. If you think it's the dip you were waiting for, good luck with welfare because I tried.

People will be going back to work and kids desperate to leave the fucking house will be getting their cars and moving about for the first time in a year. You’ll see the benefit of the pop in drivers (premium) without the crashes they’ll bring in the next 6 months.   -As my previous post explains, less people on the road have resulted in significantly less claims. Progressive made bank on people who didn’t wanna cancel their registration (no insurance means your registration gets canceled) so they stayed at home with their cars.   -Earnings is 1/27. The 2/19 play will cover this if a swing trade doesn’t hit. Do NOT play Jan 15th to save money on shorter calls.   -Last year in the same Dec to Feb time period it gained **8 dollars**. This environment of undriven cars and a light winter (with less drivers getting stuck everywhere) has potential to crush that gain.

For me personally, I started with 8k and day traded, swing traded, and stock jumped from one stock to the next from 2017 to 2019 as I learned what I was sort of doing I was able to turn 8k into 70k with stocks. Then,This year I lost damn near everything in my account ( 70k down to 6k)  when the Vid' hit in march.  I diamond handed to the bottom and then foolishly decided to sell thinking it would keep dropping and I could buy back in super fucking low.... only to sell at the bottom and watch the rocket to recovery leave me at the bottom of the trench.... Then I bitterly doubled down on a retarded theory that it would crash again and I could catch the second wave.  Bitter and anxious how I would recover from my retarded decisions I decided to started looking for a place to learn how to be a more informed trader, how to find the right stocks, how to not be a retard.   Then I found you guys! Around September of this year I started over with my 6k and decided fuck it i got nothing to lose 6k is a few nice meals or a months worth of bills...  Discovering my true retard nature and a loving community of fellow retards has allowed me to take 6k and turn it into 100k in the last 4 months.  SO from the bottom of my retarded heart - Thank you to everyone on this sub for laughing at me, teaching me, and forcing me to be a better retard in the stock market than I would have ever been without you guys.      So to my prayer; :P      Dear lord [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) ,      Please forgive me for my faith has waivered as I watch my trendies pile up and the temptation to sell is ever present. 6k to 50k to 100k,  Yae though I walk through the valley of gay bears, and paper hands - I shall fear no dip, for RC, GME Gang, and thine art with me.  Thy updates that ye are still with us re-affirms my diamond hands, and comforts my anxious water head. Thou anoited us with DD; and my cup runneth over. GME to the Moon, Fuck the gay bears, rocket kids pile in we are going to mars      In your heavenly name I pray!

I plan to rerun the script every monday morning before open, sell the ones that have been bumped off and buy what has replaced them. Script was created two days ago, stocks first purchased yesterday. All the stocks in each separate sub will be weighted evenly, so $200 for WSB and $100 for stocks.  ​ For r/wallstreetbets I will only be doing the top 5 most mentioned because it gets pretty hyper-focused over here.

I had decided June 1st to sell a shitty stock taking a long term loss this year (everything was going nuts from covid recovery and I didn’t want to miss out).  Thanks to WSB I’ve been getting some of those losses back but potentially not all, I’m down from $80k in losses to $16k in losses thanks to NIO run up.   Next I bought some GME and pussed out after earnings sold for an additional loss of $1,500 due to stop losses tighter than a virgin butthole on 12/10  The thing is, I’m getting fomo on this run and want back in but I’ve taken this loss within 30 days.  What happens if I buy this stock knowing I sold it for a loss under 30 days ago?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1737467|public|confidence|self|||Wash Sale 30 Days calculation|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kj800x/wash_sale_30_days_calculation/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I have a list of rules I follow when I take positions, and I think you might find some value if you have a similar list.  1. **Always trade to the long side - do not short.** There is an underlying elevating factor to the stock market - ""stocks only go up."" Although this is a meme, it's actually true. This means all bearish positions are fighting gravity by default. Go long, or go home. 2. **Pick a basket of individual stocks - at least 4 or 5.** If you have an 80% winning strategy, that means your basket will mostly win. If you have an 80% winning strategy and pick a loser, you're fucked. You work hard for your money, so don't fucking insult yourself by losing it you degenerate. Respect yourself and your money and stop giving it to theta goons. 3. **Only go long in an individual stock once you have a list of conditions**. Here are some of my conditions, and they usually work when I swing trade, as an example:    1. The stock is currently trading above the 180 day SMA.    2. The stock has a golden cross on the MACD.    3. The stock has a candle close above the 9 day SMA.    4. The day you enter in the position cannot be a new high.    5. Never hold through earnings.  These are all elevating factors. **To illustrate this point**, look at RAD over the past few weeks:  **10/9/20**, you had most of these confirmation points. The trade went flat and you likely would have sold the very next day at a minor loss. I look stupid, right?  But, look at **11/3/20** \- All of the elements listed above (**Except for #1**) are met, and the stock rallies hard. You could take this trade, but I like to have all my indicators met before I move.  Then, on **12/2/20** RAD crosses the 180 day SMA (so all elements are met), and rallies again. This is where someone like me comes in.  **Look at GME:** Yesterday it held above the 180 day SMA, it closed above the 9 day SMA, it had a golden cross, and it doesn't release earnings until March, so you can hold it for a while. You could have seen confirmation yesterday, bought in, and sold out today with a 5% gain.   **I'm not telling you to copy what I do. I'm just trying to give you a basic, understandable, introduction to some simple technical indicators so you don't get burned.** Or at least, you get burned less frequently.  **Also, final point: #4**. **Have a plan and stick to it.** Do you know why you have paper hands? Because you do not have a plan. There are lots of strategies online. There are people who only trade 3 bar plays. There are people who trade breakouts. There are people who trade on RSI. I don't care which one you use - just pick one and start making money. The sooner you have a plan, the sooner you will be able to get diamond hands because you'll know when you should enter and exit your positions.  **Honorable mention:**  [Tradingview.com](https://Tradingview.com). Check it out - it's charting software in the browser. **It's powerful and it's free.** I had no idea this was a thing until a few months ago. Changed my life and made screening so so so much easier.  That's it. I hope this helped at least one of you guys not throw your Christmas money into the pockets of someone else.

So interesting that I dare predict a short squeeze could happen as early as tomorrow. The magnitude of the squeeze is something that will be hard to tell, and could be dependent on factors currently unknown to us, but it will definitely be an early christmas present for many.   **What does it mean to be listed on the threshold list and what happens on the 13th consecutive day?**  The Regulation SHO Threshold Security List was created by the SEC in 2005 to reduce naked short selling. Stocks appear on this list when at least 0.5% of shares outstanding failed to be settled for 5 consecutive days or more. If a stock is on the list for 13 consecutive trading days, participants will be forced to close any settlement failures (a.k.a cover the naked shorts).  **Is GME on the threshold list?**  You bet. 12 consecutive trading days starting from 8th December 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day would fall on 24th December 2020. Shorts will be forced to cover tomorrow basically.  https://preview.redd.it/wm6n09bbs1761.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=552c76e3fdf51d81989e7021f53316385030a4ad  **Has this happened before?**  Yes. 12 consecutive days starting from 22 September 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day fell on 8th October 2020.   https://preview.redd.it/6r3d53lvs1761.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9f42ae5235bbee1b1044b42f8ce5fa6a0f382d  Guess what happened on the 8th October 2020?   [Price shot up by 41.4&amp;#37; with a staggering volume of 76 million shares](https://preview.redd.it/kktrcq0pt1761.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d85baa22a8b5666de0e888355c90b8ce02c466f1)  **So there will be squeeze tomorrow? By how much?**  I am not a prophet but I am confident a squeeze will happen tomorrow. How much would be up to your own conclusion. All I can say is that back in October, almost everyone and their wives' boyfriend were bearish on GME other than the few OGs we have here. Ryan Cohen only had a 9% stake, GME gang and their theories were laughed off. Shorts were able to cover and close their naked shorts stealthily and without much trouble.   This time round, Cohen upped his stake to 13%. WSB Capital has entered the foray with approximately 5% stake, which will probably be watered down to 2.5% of diamond hands stake.  Senvest Management has entered with a 5% stake as well. Hedgeye with 90k twitter followers sets a PT of $50 for GME. Some big player has been buying lots of GME shares for the past 2 days. 30M and 25M volume respectively. There are still 68M shares short at the moment. The market closes early tomorrow at 1pm. Shorts will have to buy a shitload amount of shares in half a trading day. Don't forget, GME is attracting a lot of attention from FOMOs and boomers with the Hedgeye tweet. Shorts will have to compete with all these buyers to cover. True available float should be much lower this time round with more big players in, and retail investors knowing about the potential short squeeze, and most importantly pure autistic energy.   TLDR: All in GME. Set sell limit at $420.69.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1737390|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/s_7lBZGY6nvGD7t9bcJzp9l2kFzM0ElUeM8J-nHEDd4.jpg|70.0|140.0|Why GME could squeeze as early as tomorrow|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kj7f8c/why_gme_could_squeeze_as_early_as_tomorrow/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I know yesterday’s DD was boring but I just had to start by laying the foundation to establish *GME’s bare minimum growth case (if I were to put a number, a low double digit growth yoy, which in today’s world is just a survival case)* ***in the gaming industry******.*** This is their baseline. This is their foundation.   Today, I’m framing a bull case I haven’t seen others lay out the blueprint for. I hope you guys can all picture it. I am willing to bet this is at least some of what Cohen sees in Gamestop. If I were Cohen, I’d be all over Gamestop too. Disclaimer: I am in e-commerce myself and I’m in a niche within consumer electronics. I make a comfortable living making more than most professionals do. Remember, all of this is on TOP of their baseline growth.   Back in September, Cohen said “long term, he wanted to make Gamestop a true competitor to Amazon” (source A). No article in September specified  the “gaming industry.” To be honest, I feel that only got added in November because to be frank, no one saw it. Everyone laughed. 1:1 competitor? I’m not so sure about this one. I believe in you Ryan, but this might take some time.      Co-existing among eBay ($35B), BestBuy ($26.5B), Amazon in the next 2\~3 years? 100% Doable. Being #2 amongst those names? Definitely achievable and the setup is too perfect to ignore.   **Gamestop vs Amazon. Advantage Gamestop has on Amazon**  · Gamestop has a location in every urban center. Even after closing 1000 locations that are losing money most likely due to them being in a mall, they still have 4000 locations. It’s time to think of them as 4000 distribution points/fulfillment centers and NOT brick and mortar stores. Amazon has 175 warehouses worldwide.   · They can deliver an item A LOT faster than Amazon or anyone else can. Almost as fast as you can get pizza/food delivery if you are in a major city.   · instant delivery via Doordash (piloting, but no problems yet). For the generation that want everything right now, this is great  · They are already set up to take trade-ins of consumer electronics and already have a reputation for it.  · Direct to consumer = no middle man = greater connection with consumers as well as greater profit.  · When it comes to new items, it’s safe to say that Gamestop has buying power advantage over almost all, if not ALL eBay/Amazon sellers.  · By not having a huge warehouse and carrying 12 million SKUs, their operation is much more efficient. Consumer electronics with the exception of television, are all very compact. (It’s not a loss though a TV is not a hot item people replace every couple of years).   **Now here is where it's gonna get sweet.**  **Ever watch Forrest Gump? Cohen spots Forrest Gamestop sprinting through the field in a true autist form, but he sees the potential in him, as the fastest receiver of tendies.**  · Consumer electronics is one of the most popular and one of the most profitable categories in ecommerce. Think drones, phones, computers, tablets, gaming consoles, VR… etc.  · When it comes to used consumer electronics, the profit margin is actually bigger. In major cities, even as a ‘nobody’, it is not difficult to make $100 flipping devices, and flip 20 devices/week. This is how I got started so I know firsthand.  · It also comprises the most commonly bought and sold items on local classifieds such as Craigslist, Kijiji, and Facebook marketplace.   · Currently the only business with a global presence to facilitate buying/selling them used is eBay.   **Where eBay &amp; others fail/their MAJOR drawbacks when it comes to used. Remember, this is the ONLY names in the game.**  · Long shipping times and many inconveniences to put up with to get the product  · Inconsistency.  · Risk of fraud or at the very least, risk of time being wasted leading to frustration.   Do you see it now? Gamestop is a unicorn hybrid in the marketplace filling the gap between Amazon and eBay, in the most profitable and most category in ecommerce as well as offline, with faster delivery, and you can bet your ass that with Cohen running it, better customer experience.   **But c’mon dude. With a name like Gamestop? How do you think they can establish this in people’s hearts and minds as the consumer electronics shop?**   How about this name? PowerUp, now it makes sense, right?   They already have 55M PowerUp members, compared to 165M Amazon Prime members, it’s not a lot. At the same time, it’s not little, but GME has also created a revolving door by giving them more in store credit than cash for their trade ins.   **Valuation**  Unless all shorts are underwater at $16.00 right? Let me use $16.00 as an example, because it will NEVER fall below it now. Meaning? shorts will eventually close.   That puts the market cap at $1,1B. Amongst 4000 stores. $276,000/store. Try setting up a store in locations Gamestop is set up at, with inventory and trained staff for $276,000.  It’s not possible. You would probably spend that on set up/reno and inventory alone and that’s not even including the brand presence that’s already built into people’s hearts and minds for buying and selling used consumer electronics.  Yeah but the valuation is low because they’re losing money! Without any of the things I mentioned today materializing, they’re going to be posting positive profit moving forward for sure after closing 1000 losing stores and focussing on e-commerce.   Guess what though? Gamestop is already slowly gearing towards what I laid out. Check out their website. Drones, tablets, VR, phones, consoles, used games, computers.   ALL of what I laid out today, is ON TOP of the gaming foundation I laid out yesterday.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**   **Squeeze valuation**   $103 MINIMUM  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀** $326 Maximum before coming back down to $40. Timeline 1\~4 months. I will talk about the squeeze valuation tomorrow. There’s a major positive I haven’t seen others mention.  Ask yourself, have you 4x’d your money in the past 1\~4 months?  **🚀**   **Position**  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C.

Aren't they effectively helping us stabilize the stock while shorts collectively pay borrowing fees?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1737087|public|confidence|self|||The put options that messed up our GME run today|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kj5day/the_put_options_that_messed_up_our_gme_run_today/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

You retards seem to know a thing or two. So in the past couple weeks alone, I managed to flip my $10k into $25k by yoloing my entire portfolio into a weed stock. That’s when I discovered call options. Long story short, the next two weeks would become the some of the most miserable, as I lost the entire $25k due to bad call option decisions. Now I’m really eager to just get my money back and feel really dumb for getting myself into this situation. I have $15k in my savings left, and am desperate to get my money back plus more, but this time I don’t want to make stupid gambling decisions. So, this is what I’m thinking for my next positions:  $10k into $TSLA calls 700 7/21  $3-$4k into $GME calls 25 1/21  Rest of the $1-2k into whatever   What do you guys think of these positions? Any suggestions on what I should or should NOT do? Also any suggestions on any stocks are welcome too. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.  TL;DR: Lost my entire portfolio due to bad plays, have $15k left in savings I want to invest to get my money back and more, and have certain positions I want to invest the $15k in but want any and all advice or any other stock suggestions to help me get back to where I was.

This post isn’t to take it away from that.  But I’ve been having much more success by taking myself almost fully out of the details and looking at company’s from a birds eye view. Holding stocks or calls (that are out at least 3 months)  My current portfolio  Safe bets (this is where I re invest all of my options gains, this is all of the research I’ve done) Disney — amazing scope in industry, theme parks, streaming, movies, and brand name Sony — absolutely monster of a balance sheet. Dominant in consoles. Activision — one of the only gaming companies that push out thrilling and popular games  Also hold Amazon stocks but that’s through RSUs.  My options bets AES — energy stock, renewable energy. I’m Betting on a big contract or for it to gain traction on any news of government giving preferential treatment.  2/19/2021 13 27C  CCL — Carnival. They almost guaranteed are planning worst and best scenario in order to prep themselves for the 2021 season. A company this size will not allow itself to be turned to dust even for a global pandemic, something will be done and I’m betting on that. 4/16/2021 3 27.5C  XOM — monster of a balance sheet as well with focus on renewable energy. Oil will not go away in the next 5 years and they are known more of an energy stock nowadays rather than just oil. 7/16/2021 2 50C  BP — same as above 1/21/2022 4 30C  ATT — truly a gamble to see what will happen. Price has been depressed and with the amount of brand and exposure and customer base they have I do think they may make a comeback 1/21/2022 6 35C  Ford — betting on their new electric vehicles and the possibility of landing good contracts selling batteries. Also like their CEO, much more forward thinking.  1/21/2022 7 15C  Nokia — Full gamble here as well. They have good engineers and they have good programmers. They have the experience and they still have the name that people remember. Betting on a full reinvention of themselves, they also got a new Chief Strategy officer that I’ve no idea who is but hoping here they made a decent choice and he starts taking risks  1/20/23 18 7C  Veritone and Plug — just a couple hundred shares each IV is too high for the risk for me. Already made about a grand each but I’ve literally done no research on it but just overview stuff. Will probably offload in Jan or Feb when hype dies down  This is an absolute trash DD and it’s not PLTR, GME or TSLA so I’ll take all the downvotes :)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1735941|public|confidence|self|||This market has taught me that a much simpler strategy is needed|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiywwb/this_market_has_taught_me_that_a_much_simpler/|some_ads|7.0||dark||||||||||

I’m new to trading and slowly learning how to buy stocks and options. I want to share my thoughts on the technology side of things.  I think the comparison between GameStop and Blockbuster is both right and wrong. It’s right when talking about brick &amp; mortar business losing to digital, but wrong in comparing movies to games. They are completely separate technologies.  Movies are pre-rendered and ran on the CPU. Games are rendered in real-time on the GPU. In other words, movies are in the business of CPUs while games are in the business of GPUs. This is why gaming is so important to Nvidia and AMD.   I believe that Blockbuster failed because they didn’t realize they were actually in the CPU business. How did Netflix defeat Blockbuster? They bought a ton of CPUs from Amazon and ran movies on them. With that CPU power they destroyed Blockbuster and became the de facto for movies.   With Microsoft partnering with GameStop means $GME will get Azure GPUs for cheap. Which means POWER! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  I believe we are seeing the start of a proxy war between the cloud providers namely Amazon CPUs (Prime Video &amp; Netflix) vs Microsoft GPUs (xCloud and GameStop).

But I remember the 2005-2010 drama around BB and GME right now has too many eery similarities for me to go anywhere near it.  BB had 9,000 stores and had cornered the home video market. Retail landlords sought out BB locations because they generated traffic for the restaurants and grocery stores nearby, it exploded in store count in about a decade. It's core business became a melting ice cube as Netflix's mail DVD business and streaming business took off, along with Redbox rental boxes at gas stations and convenience stores. EPS got killed as it steadily closed thousands of stores due to plummeting revs. Icahn steps in during this decline to buy a big stake, urges changes to the core business model, got into disagreements with the board and president and ultimately sold his stake for less than ten percent of what he paid. Months later, BB is bankrupt. Icahn has repeatedly said BB was the worst investment of his life.  Idk if GME is going to end up the same way, I do not know because the dynamics in the gaming industry and console cycle are a bit different than the movie and home rental business in the 2000s. But the parallels are eerily similar. You have two retailers that had explosive store growth over a decade or so due to active solicitation by commercial landlords at the urging of anchor tenants who want the foot traffic, you have two retailers that then are quickly eaten alive by plummeting store revs due to innovative competiton,, you have shares that have precipitously fallen in price as the companies have frantically closed underperformong stores to stop the bleeding, you have big gun activist investors coming in late in the life cycle pushing changes to the core business that are merely a hope and a prayer (at this point for Cohen anyway, GME has narely acknowledged the demands), you have opportunistic retail investors coming in after the fact hoping the hope becomes a new business model and bidding the shares up.  Maybe Cohen can push the changes through. I have zero faith in GME management turning the core B&amp;M business around, let alone stabilize it. Why? This is purely anecdotal - a couple of months before COVID, I passed by GME's new concept store while staying at the Mall of America. It is called ""Gamestop: Pop Culture."" It was a Gamestop with substantially lower floor space dedicated to games, with the remaining 75% of the space selling gundam kits and Hello Kitty and anime and Funko Pops. So GME management's grand idea to save the business before Cohen was to fight ThinkGeek over the dying table scraps of mall traffic. I am not convinced.  TLDR - Long ROKU, $700 target."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1735529|public|confidence|self|||GME management &amp; Ryan Cohen remind me a lot of the Blockbuster &amp; Carl Icahn disaster of 2010|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kix4q6/gme_management_ryan_cohen_remind_me_a_lot_of_the/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!  And an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I’m gonna call you Jim).    Now Jim, from what I’ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don’t always get a lot of love around here. But that’s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.” Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they’re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?  Anyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we’re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin’ brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you’re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim—simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we’re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They’re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids’ Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there’s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you’re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin’ viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and “*if they’re running GME, then do some work on GME*,” we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What’s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander.   Now, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don’t know—I don’t know if I’ll have enough time. But I’ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don’t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that’s just, like, your opinion man, and we’ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint.   First thing’s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman’s rug.  Now, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you’ve wandered into. And I know you’re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then “make sure you know GME.” So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it’s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much.   **Part 1: GME’s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**  Now, I’m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it’s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your “Stay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!” rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We’ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.  So to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today—by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen’s interest is over 10%.  Now, I’m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: “how is that even legal?” fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. But by all means run your manic ass over to the goddamn sound machine to get your viewers to munch on that big box stock.  Are you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then—there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I’m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It’s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he’s not going anywhere).

First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight—I’m sorry, I’m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim – this story is made for TV, man—and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had “nothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.”   [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702)   But Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It’s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman’s “Thine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All” Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I’m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that’s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you’re about to go bankrupt.  No, no – I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don’t. That’s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it’s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&amp;M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They’re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they’re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.  So fine, they’re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee’s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim:   First, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That’s higher than Nike, Macy’s, the Apple Store—and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88)   [https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)  That’s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad ass letter that identifies GME’s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\_Ventures\_Letter\_to\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)   So now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?  Now, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation’s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now—where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don’t really need to get into the details on that here, because it’s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don’t know. Millions of people don’t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin’ rolled-up sleeves.  **Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers’ Dumbass Heads**   And now we’ve gotten to the best part. It’s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all—and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol’ sound machine—I don’t know your fucking methods. But the real thing that’s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.  Now you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\_tribe\_a\_story\_about\_how\_ryan\_cohen\_is\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer’s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we’ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.  But here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares—starting on Tuesday December 15th—which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week—500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We’ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.  There was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you’re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.  Now, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I’m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot’s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it’s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here.   [http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/](http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/)  [https://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-HestiaCapital-PermitCapital-GameStop-BoardofDirectors-ShareholderActivism.html](https://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-HestiaCapital-PermitCapital-GameStop-BoardofDirectors-ShareholderActivism.html)  And if you follow u/snowk88 over at stocktwits (@snowk88)—you don’t? ‘the fuck is wrong with you?— you’d also find a wealth of DD on how Olshan rolls when entering these activist-investor-replaces-dumbass-boards-and-CEOs type disputes. To bottom line it: **they get it fucking done**.   [https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534)  [https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266155112](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266155112)  [https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266153175](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266153175)  But what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board *“regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.""* And while RC Ventures *“desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*  I really like that last part, don’t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he’s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.  And now seems like a good time to return to those “Ryan Cohen: Boy Genius” articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated last year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he’s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here’s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:  \*\*\*  Bloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)  · ""It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,"" he says. ""When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in.""   · Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”  · He wouldn’t, however, recommend his \[non-diversified\] investment approach to everyone. “You need to have the temperament to block the noise,” he says. “Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.”  · He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. ""I don't want to swing for a single,"" he says.  \*\*\*  You hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim – we’re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what’s the takeaway here? I’d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it’s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.  Here’s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:  \*\*\*  Forbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)  · “For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‘no’s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.”  · “I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.”  · “\[M\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.”  · “Dad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world’s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I’m flexible on details, but I’m never willing to give up.”  \*\*\*  Goddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you’ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.  But to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?  So where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude’s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann’s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592)  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can’t believe you’re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I’m holding pocket Kings I’m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you’re about to drop two Aces on my ass.  Anyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):  *I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*  We’re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:  *If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*  And now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I’m not sure I see it given the attorneys he’s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala’s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they’ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison. Now everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it’s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.  But even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today’s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision—then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I’d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. First, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That’s gruesomely delicious, isn’t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone—especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021—will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they’ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen’s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Know As GameStop’s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly.   **Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who’s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**  Now, Jim, given the fast friendship we’re creating here, and all we’ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we’ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I’m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*—many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that’s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\_cramer\_reveals\_dirty\_tricks\_short\_sellers\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)  [https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)  So where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here—who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone.   So for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the “new truth” or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it’s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?  And I know we’re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do ""because the SEC doesn't understand it."" But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME:   [https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It’s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.  I think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it’s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often—and maybe don’t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them—for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we’re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you’re smarter than the rest of us who do—but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass.   Now I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn’t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground—while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I’m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn’t mind too. Though he’s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he’s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I’m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up.   So maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what’s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what’s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.  In conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don’t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.  And Happy Holidays everyone.  \--CPT Hubbard  **TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds. DD on the GME turnaround is solid and overleveraged short sellers should be shitting themselves. Ryan Cohen, our polite, hard-working Canadian benefactor is about to rip all our fucking faces off and trigger a MOASS.

Have been browsing around the sub for a while, but I never bothered really commenting, much less posting. I had been browsing on WSB and obviously, the entire discussion about GME caught my eye.  Don’t get me wrong. These decisions are always looking dangerous and scary to me. I’m a student with not a lot to invest, and every penny  that can realistically make me a profit, is amazing to me. I’m just looking to build up a successful future for not only me, but my family.   I had been trying to register into websites, researching a bit into my legal requirements. Being a full-time student in a foreign country (UK), things seemed quite tough to me. The country specifically asks me for Tax-ID, when I can’t provide it. Having my other country’s Tax-ID, I thought it’d work just fine, but since I had created a my personal bank account (REVOLUT) in the foreign country, it specifically required the foreign country’s TID. I’m terribly confused at this, and don’t know how to advance about it. I’ve questioned if the websites could shut my account for this same reason, leaving all the money I had in there, gone.   Parents had told me that when you look at it that way, it doesn’t seem fun enough to do anymore, and I agree. The uncertainty of the future of my account, doesn’t seem appealing to me, if I were to ever create one.  I know I seem like I haven’t done much research about my situation, and I do admit, I haven’t, but when the information I receive or inquire about is too vague, it makes me doubt if I should even make an account or not just to see it poof up into space dust.   I appreciate any help, wether it’d be redirecting me to the right sub, or just giving me tips on how to handle these situations appropriately.  Have a great day! :)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1733386|public|confidence|self|||[Advice Request] How do I get started as an international university student?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kims4c/advice_request_how_do_i_get_started_as_an/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I’m breaking them down to chewable bits (less than 5 min read ea) because I know reading isn’t fun. I’m with you, I don’t enjoy reading either. Please let me know kindly if any of this gets too boring.   Through this series of DDs, I hope to show you guys perhaps *some* of what Cohen sees.   Please note that I will be referring to these 2 points in this DD, and maybe even throughout this DD series. These are the most important points that would form the foundation of my DD but they aren't the 'freshest' I apologize.   **1. Let me start by pointing out that most of us WSB autists are privileged. There exists the others, who actually make up the majority of the population** who/whose kids can’t afford to risk losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars making “educated guesses”/gambling the way we do.   As a group, it’s easy for us to confirm each other’s biases, forget about the rest and create our own echo chamber.   **2. Digital games is overtaking physical copies. This is true.**   SONY, EA, Take Two all have crossed a tipping point where more than half of their console games are now sold via download 51%, 52% and 55%   For Sony, it was up from 37% last year. (Source A)      Generally, the growth of digital vs discs seems to be quite even, so using SONY as an example, that’s a 38% increase (Yes. It’s a 14% difference, but it’s a 38% increase from 37% that takes it to 51%). That means GME’s going to experience apx 26% decrease YOY in sales.   **BUT!**    The global console games market is expected to grow from $40.6 billion in 2019 to about $57.9 billion in 2020 (source B) That’s a 42.6% increase.  &amp;#x200B;  [The numbers,](https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795d2a001ba7d25b4e7275f732ba8514d3df0c17)   **Young Mason:** This mean physical copies are dying! GME is DEAD!      Not quite. Actually, not at all. GME will definitely get a smaller piece of the *console pie*, but the pie itself has grown and they will actually get a larger pie.  **But wait, there’s more!** The research/stats was published in May. Did anyone project COVID will be as bad as it is now? Stay at home kids want to play games, meet desperate WFH parents that want a break. I am confident that the 2 factors push the numbers a lot higher than $57.90 Billion, but hey for now let’s just use that.      Also remember, that % for digital games download vs physical is based on quantity including all the shit/old games they push for cheap and people buy out of boredom. Although the numbers aren’t reported solid, the consensus is, is that more disc consoles are sold because people want to play their old disc games. Even at a modest 50/50, we’re locked in more or less until the next console cycle.   **But wait, there’s even more!**      So the console pie has grown 42.6%. You know what else has grown and is growing?    Gaming overall! Mobile, PC, even board games, they’ve all been growing. Checkout Gamestop’s website.    They’ve been getting into phones, computer parts and board games. It’s not out of desperation. It is the right move as Gamestop is really establishing its brand as one stop shop for games. When you think building supplies, you think Home Depot. Soon, when you think games, you will think Gamestop.  Gamestop is already set up for used games/devices trading like no one else. Phones are super liquid and high in demand (This isn't anything serious YET, I will cover this in another DD). Did I tell you that the digital consoles are now more tradable/rentable too? No moving parts = very low risk of damage other than drops/spills. Keep an eye on this. Remember the point #1.    Carrying computer parts also shield them from any sort of lockdown possibility because computer parts are essential. Bigger pie, and more pies.       **What you are saying makes sense… but bro, don’t you remember Q3 earnings?**  Yes, I do…Bro. They had a decrease in revenue. Do you remember Q3 was for August, September, October?   Were you really thinking about video games back then? We were all out there seeing friends, partying, enjoying nature thinking either Covid was gone and it was renaissance or thinking second wave is coming, and we have to enjoy it while it lasts.   **Establishing its brand? Are you nuts? People hate GME.**  Yes. **We do**. We all have that bitter memory. We remember the day when we or our friend went to GME to literally get hustled as a noob kid like we remember going to the strip club to get hustled as a noob adult.       Remember, we are ALL 18\~40+, ‘privileged’ minority. (Point#1).     Peak gaming target demographics is around 13\~25.  Right now, GME is putting trade value of all games online, updated daily and it isn’t as ‘hustly’ as it used to be. This is a simple change, but powerful. People now know exactly what to expect, and they’d only bring in games/consoles, when they see the money/credit is worth more for them.  Results? Happier transactions on both ends, and better branding moving forward.  They’ve also been spending a lot more on advertising for brand recognition. That recognition will soon put them in a spot where they are the only one that can organize e-sports/gaming tournaments in the western world in any meaningful way.   I will leave you with this. The majority (Point #1) isn’t so lucky to start blowing money at the launch of a new console. Where can the majority go to fill their increase in gaming needs while being fiscally conservative during this pandemic? eBay? With all this shipping delays?   Like how Amazon is eating eBay’s breakfast but eBay will always have its market share in ecommerce, GME will always have its place in gaming at the very least.   **Tomorrow I will tell you why GME will crush Amazon and not the other way around, and also touch up on either what their current valuation means to Cohen, or the future of gaming.**  Don’t worry, I’m even going to cover Stadia at one point too.  &amp;#x200B;      Sources A:  [https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-sony-and-take-two-now-sell-more-console-games-digitally-than-boxed/](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-sony-and-take-two-now-sell-more-console-games-digitally-than-boxed/)  Sources B:  [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/how-the-gaming-industry-may-be-experiencing-rapid-growth-during-the-pandemic-301126092.html#:\~:text=A%20recent%20report%20from%20ResearchAndMarkets,about%20%2457.9%20billion%20in%202020](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/how-the-gaming-industry-may-be-experiencing-rapid-growth-during-the-pandemic-301126092.html#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20from%20ResearchAndMarkets,about%20%2457.9%20billion%20in%202020).

In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp  For example let’s assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.  You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.    Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.  So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.  Your break even is kind of ass but that’s because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.    If it’s a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it’s 18.8.    That’s a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.  So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.  For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.  https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme  Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren’t going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.  But why has it been spiking if it’s not a short squeeze, and that’s really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don’t buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.  But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He’s in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn’t being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.  Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That’s what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn’t going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn’t going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.   TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don’t be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1733010|public|confidence|self|||GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kil4wu/gme_short_squeeze_is_a_myth_that_assumes_massive/|some_ads|7.0|#dadada|dark|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '822NPCZ48e6EgaBFb-W_KT_TVlbTurw3D2mP6R9AYLY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 70, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8376ee83cdece9b712c07a1131483fc1a5c5712e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 141, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=816318beefa5c663dd7d93be44800bba0516c0eb', 'width': 216}, {'height': 209, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ba3e9c9af35cee008037b27fab0eadac7d538bc', 'width': 320}, {'height': 418, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ee637f5b7918b2bb4779f93b3316d98dde1ff43', 'width': 640}, {'height': 627, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a81289765e11c7f531e51b115eea72088685a62', 'width': 960}, {'height': 706, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0582fd1a9a74f0f86a972a4a46ee2f7ae651f03', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2553, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/egEZznu650Hx5bTeO3qGYU0lZEgXs2C3Sry2ie-YkCw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=551107ed0d9e31e878d044bd166d4e7644c41930', 'width': 3903}, 'variants': {}}]}|78806c26-46a2-11e9-82c1-0ee7a9b74720|||||||

It was going to argue the following as being bullish  1. improving balance sheets with possible future credit upgrades 2. easier access to credit (bless you jpow) - kills the bankrupcy risk 3. console cycle ( meaning more sales and likely sales of higher margin merchandise like accessories) 4.  low valuation relative to revenue 5.  higher short interest post earnings (ever seen bears that trap themselves?)  But since you guys managed to do great pumping the stock I decided it wasn't necessary.   There's few a bearish thesis which I'm going to dismiss because it's all gay bear talk.

I never imagined my first DD would be a warrant arbitrage play, but this is 2020. I’ve got something gay bears and big ball bulls will like. Big Rock Partners Acquisition (BRPA) is about to give you big cock tendies.   What is BRPA you ask? It’s a SPAC set to merge with NeuroRx, Inc. is a clinical stage, small molecule pharmaceutical company which develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 (RLF-100 or ""ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil)"") and Bipolar Depression (NRX-100, 101). An article recently came out that COVID ICU patients survival rates tripled on this drug.  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurorx-and-relief-announce-initial-successful-results-from-expanded-access-use-of-rlf-100-aviptadil-in-patients-with-critical-covid-19-and-severe-comorbidity-72-survival-seen-in-icu-patients-301179820.html  Do you need to know anything beyond that? No. Do you care are about anything beyond that? No. Should you? Maybe.    What’s important to note is the stock is at ~$52 rn. The warrants, BRPAW are at ~$7. You can exercise the warrants post merger into stock for 11.50. For all you retards out there this means should remain approx $11.50 below the stock price. Thus, these warrants are severely undervalued. This is because of extremely low float. Well shouldn’t I go balls deep in warrants then? I did very happily did, but there is a potential drawback. The majority of commons got recalled. They have an extremely low float. That's why the stock price is so disconnected from the warrant price.  When warrants can be excised, they will dilute the stock. Which will have a big impact, because they will increase the float by a lot due to the recalled shares. The warrants price in an unusual amount of dilution.  Don't hold them until after the merger. So gay bears, even if the stock is getting pumped  and may be overvalued and will come crashing down to $18, the warrant’s value is still solid. In that case, you don’t stand to lose all that much money.  If stock price stays flat we are talking 500% gains on the arbitrage.

According to \[iborrowdesk\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)), shares available for borrow did not change at all today. This shows 2 things.  &amp;#x200B;   Firstly, the institutional shorts like BOfA and melvin have yet to cover, yet are getting pushed further underwater. When/If the squeeze eventually occurs, it is going to be violent. This also shows that the price dips at the 19 range was not a short attack but rather weak hands profit taking.   &amp;#x200B;  Secondly, a big player is accumulating. Either it’s Cohen trying to increase his stake for takeover(he’ll have to report within 2 days), or another institution buying. Either way its bullish.  &amp;#x200B;  Now, heres the important part. Take a look at this chart, paying attention to the red crayon marks.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/5i6dco7lqr661.jpg?width=3038&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d2c3e40eb68b649d7d8b42eb6acff2ad4f3a970  Before every console season, some idiots start shorting GME, resulting in a mini short squeeze in 2008 and  2014. At its peak, it had a share price of about $64. Now, take a look at how much higher the short interest is, and how much lower the float (total number of shares issued) is. Accounting for the same peak market cap, this gives a conservative estimate of $150 if the squeeze occurs. Note that due to the significantly higher short interest, it may very well exceed 150 by a mile.  &amp;#x200B;  Lastly, for the short squeeze to occur, we need to all stop being paperhanded bitches. stop fucking selling at a 20% gain when u can easily get a 10x gain. The more liquidity u give to shorters, the less violent the short squeeze.  &amp;#x200B;  tldr: GME to $150 provided people stop being paperhanded hoes.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1729288|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rOodi8pAf3XoSveNDwFpPCtquNY6lvUhZOoFyB8pMYM.jpg|54.0|140.0|Why a $150 price target for GME is realistic|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ki99rp/why_a_150_price_target_for_gme_is_realistic/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

I think it's one of the best free ways to do some real time DD. It's flawed in many ways because it's not always clear why people are searching for something. Just because ""Ford Cars"" becomes a big search term it doesn't necessarily mean that Ford is going to go up, it might mean Ford cars began to explode, etc.  With that in mind, and also bearing in mind this is all *my opinion* on things, here are some of the search trends for GME.  https://imgur.com/a/rDktx4x  Checking the search term ""Gamestop Playstation"" lets you compare across years. What this chart means is that the search term ""Gamestop Playstation"" in Nov 2020 is about 400% larger than it has been since 2012. You'll note that the chart includes 2013, the year the PS4 was released.  The bump for Xbox is there but not as huge. It still does beat all of the last 9 years including the launch of the Xbone.  https://imgur.com/a/Jg4rA8g  Hang on because this is where it gets a little bumpy. I have contended that COVID is damping down interest in going to GME stores in person. That's a tough one to tease out of this data but I think you can get a proxy.  First, searches for ""is gamestop open""  https://imgur.com/a/rXAsSvt  That huge blue dildo at the end is a break from the past which would normally occur at Nov to Dec, this year it happened starting March. I think you can guess why. But why does this matter?  The next chart is ""gamestop trade in"" which we know is a big part of their business. You see a spike in 2013 when the last gen consoles were released. Then you see an even bigger spike the year after as people are getting new used games for the consoles they bought the year before. Then a long steady trend down, which makes sense.  Now pay close attention, when did this search term start to plunge way below its trendline, yes right as COVID started. I contend that COVID is suppressing interest in game trade ins and we will see a massive rebound when COVID gets its boot off our neck.  https://imgur.com/a/9gvSnpd   Long 10K shares, avg cost basis $14.50. I have also promised to self-ban from WSB if it doesn't hit 27.18 by 6-17-21. I await my battle with the autonazi.

Im back with some more bullish DD on our very favourite gamestop incorporation. To preface, I am not a financial advisor so fuck off SEC and mods. If you're new here, the old DD is there for you to read, I wont repost it. The best way to hold this is **BUYING AND HOLDING SHARES**.  As we know, the gamestop bankrupt hypothesis is completely obliterated at this point and for the mid to long term future. the NeXt BlOcKbStEr bullshit is out the window. done. I'm also not going to talk about any type of short squeeze, we already know about that and you can read about that elsewhere.   **Heres a list of things that we know:**  * Cohen *just* increased his stake in gamestop to almost 13%. * Gamestop is closing unprofitable locations * Gamestop is *omnichanneling* their retard energy into online  * Melvin capital has a MASSIVE short position and they are sweating * BofA also has a large short position * Sherman is clueless * Gamestop will likely surprise wall street with their holiday sales and eps   But why is this important? Who gives a fuck? dont we already know this shit?  Many saw cohen as a potential catalyst but it was a gamble. Since he entered his position at such a low share price, he could easily leave it and take a profit. And after suffering through that earnings call the two options for cohen were: GTFO or hostile takeover.   * Since cohen ***Increased*** his holding after that debacle, it is easy to see that he will not be leaving us high and dry. **It is now impossible for sherman to dilute his position to under 11%. He is preparing for war.** We can speculate all day into what this means, but one thing is certain. If GameStop doesn't shape up, Cohen will do ***Something.*** This is bullish  This one's a no brainer, but sometimes can scare people off. Headlines that GameStop is closing more stores may seem bearish, but heres why it's not:   * It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is ***LOSING MONEY*** or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. **Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.**  Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the **one stop video game and video game related product online retailer.** While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that **If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in.** Expect to see real progress made.  &amp;#x200B;  Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it **WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.**   &amp;#x200B;  Sherman is a clueless boomer who is gonna have his ass handed to him by the younger, smarter, better Ryan Cohen. I mean look at this guy. He's gonna get his ass handed to him and have no clue what's happening. Cohen has a gun to his head and he's sweating.   [Just look at his face. You can see the fear in his eyes. The fake smile. He is terrified.](https://preview.redd.it/wqrztm3vjn661.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1eaace117ae61da56ef5d741be36d1e05d71246)  Finally, It is likely that GME will more than likely beat earnings next quarter. I won't go into much detail into this because it is not my expertise, however u/Uberkikz11 has done some amazing DD and has been doing so for a long time. This guy literally goes into GameStop stores to get his information. Read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically, GameStop is a very solid bet. Barring the event of a total market crash and new bullish news, I think it is extremely realistic to hit 17-20 by EOY. Obviously this is a shares play, but for you gamblers, I cant see jan 15 16-20 calls not printing bigly. Long term calls or leaps too. If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual. Fortunately these swings dont burn much theta as they are relatively common and expected.   &amp;#x200B;  **For those of you who cant read**  GME GO UP SHARES SHARES SHARES JAN 16-20CALL FOR GAMBLER RETARD|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1727139|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5TynwY8WYSx3qUfjYpwWuqGDabTppe-0fbnDAGrb8gs.jpg|140.0|140.0|GME: Why it's time for shorts to give up.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khwlj3/gme_why_its_time_for_shorts_to_give_up/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

They've reduced their net debt YOY and has been able to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet over the course of this pandemic.  **Copper**  After a small decline of 0.2% in 2019, world copper mine production, adjusted for historical disruption factors, is expected to decline by about 1.5% in 2020 and then to recover by around 4.5% in 2021:  Copper prices are currently at an all time high (look at chart below) and demand for copper will pick up significantly into 2021 as economies start to recover. Like steel, this is a no brainer cyclical economic crash play, and people will always fucking need copper.   https://preview.redd.it/91u0up2ntk661.png?width=699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ed529e67a3c56655ba6c3da2f521da6166e82b  **70% of the world's copper is used in applications that deliver electricity**  * Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations, high efficiency motors use roughly **4x more copper** than traditional automobiles    * We know the EV hype is there and coming into fruition with countries committing to be climate neutral by 20\_\_, there will be even more demand for copper as production ramps up * Solar panels and associated hardware use copper vs. the traditional fossil fuel power generators * 5G higher frequency spectrum requires more than 10x the hardware of 4g and there's plenty of associated copper cabling   **Copper supply takes a long time to ramp up (i.e. getting mines approved, excavation, etc)**  and FCX is in the midst of massively ramping its biggest mine which will roughly double output next year.  Copper is used in building construction, power generation and transmission, electronic product manufacturing, and the production of industrial machinery and transportation vehicles. Copper is an essential component in the motors, wiring, radiators, connectors, brakes, and bearings used in cars and trucks.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/g2zry31kvk661.png?width=386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd35220322d168ea1636d0906b52841d5c84bba7  **FCX OUTLOOK 2021**  **Volume Growth (2021e v. 2020e)** = Copper 20%+, Gold 70%+ 🚀🚀🚀  **Expanding Margins =** EBITDA/Cash Flows to approximately double in 2021e compared to 2020e  🚀🚀🚀  **Near-term: Laser Focused on Execution** = Continued net debt reduction 🚀🚀🚀🚀  **Sustained growth** in copper demand is expected to continue as **copper is essential to economic activity** and even more so to the modern technological society.

ATH was ~$9B cap back in 2007/2008 and a less high ~$6,5B cap in 2013. This would put share price today at $130 and $95 with the shares outstanding that GameStop currently has (69.75 million).   For the share price to reach $1000 would ""only"" take a $70B market cap. For reference, other companies with such a market cap include: CSX, CB, BDX, LRCX Don't know who they are? Neither do I. Boomer companies with large caps.  For a more conservative example, how would a $500 price valuation ($35B cap) look like compared to others in that range? SYY (food distribution), CMG (Chipotle), F (Ford) and EBAY (eBay).  Even comparing to Best Buy ($26B market cap) would already raise share price to $370  If Cohen does a complete turnaround for GameStop and makes it a household name in the gaming industry (something like Steam but EVERYTHING gaming related) then I can see $500 becoming pretty reasonable (might even be low-balling it). However even if he takes over that would be mid- to long-term valuations since it would take quite a bit of work to pull off all the changes. So what are we banking on right now? The positive earnings for Q4 + maybe some Cohen news to get the ball rolling to tendie land and maybe a mild short squeeze to help.  Perhaps. Or maybe there's still *some* chance for an infinity squeeze if MM uses logic.  With the current share price, for Boomer Sherman &amp; Co to issue the shelf order, it would dilute the shares with an additional 6-7 million shares (to get the $100 million worth). However what if they waited for the share to reach obscene heights (say $1000) they would reach their $100 million with only 100k shares. Thus very minimal dilution would occur.  Obviously this has a lot of speculation in it, so don't take what I said too seriously. I mainly wrote this down so I can visualize it better for myself and confirm my own bias that GME is going to the moon.  Oh and fun fact; according to the ownership list for WSB, we own approximately 3.8 Million shares of GameStop, 5.8% or ~$57 million worth of GME (soon to be Billions). 🚀🚀🚀"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1721220|public|confidence|self|||GME Interesting Squeeze Facts &amp; Market Cap &amp; Future Valuations|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgsl8r/gme_interesting_squeeze_facts_market_cap_future/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||

Fundamentals  Unemployment numbers  885,000 total vs 808,000 expected unemployment is simply bad no more needs to be said.  Consumer spending power is going down Every state is seeing a decline in personal income. This will affect most companies and will lead to unimpressive Christmas sales.  The US dollar is weakening and will only continue on the next Stimulus   The stimulus Its underwhelming not sexy at all. Wheres my Trump bucks????????  Countries all over the world are reaching all time highs as their government desperately try to sell their bonds its simply not healthy.   All the firms know this cannot last there has to be a pull back and when it does they will end richer than they were before. They hold this up by buying stocks.

Uberkiks11 has done DD so deep that he's basically an oracle at this point so strap in and get ready. I'll try and throw some key points down that I haven't seen covered in a lot of the other Gamestop DD.   ## the GME situation.  It should be no secret by now that people have been shifting away from Brick and Motor retailers and convenience shopping has largely shifted to online. We've all been fudded to death with blockbuster analogies and the rise of online gaming and steam. So why would anyone ever step foot in a Gamestop?   While true that people are shifting away from standard brick and motor they are also seeking human interaction and experiential retail experiences. Part of the Sherm overhaul is specifically focusing on making these stores hubs to get expert knowledge from, and talk shit about peoples favorite games.   You know who loves to hang out in stores and endlessly talk about fantasy worlds with clerks and then spend money? Gamers, the lonely and Otakus all of which were packing out a local EB games (NZ Gamestop) and it was packed not only with people buying games but verbally shitposting at the clerks about the finer points of the Halo nerf gun and its accuracy compared to the game, which frankly as bullish as all the people walking out of there with EB game bags.   Over this side of the world our internet can be a little shithouse some times as well. To the point that if you are trying to download a game that is unironically 90GBs it can take 2 days and blow your entire internet cap. This demographic is a lot larger then you think as most people don't have the patience or time to wait for the latest game hot the market. So no people are not going to be only downloading through online stores quite just yet. Also gamers love to show their collection. Its a mark of pride to show the your evolution and lineage from the first disk of Crash Bandicoot to your modern day COD collection.   Another addition I haven't seen mentioned in any recent DD is that the new PS5 only has 667GBs of storage. That is absolutely not hard to pack out with a few modern games and the ability to have more storage is disabled, to be [enabled on a future update](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch).  ## okay but what about the massive amount of losses?  Part of these losses was writing off GOODWILL which is comprised of intangible assets which essentially means THEY DIDN'T LOSE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH ACTUAL DOLLARS. They were writing off the fact they pissed their customers off and drove the brand name into the mud. So it is entirely likely they can return to profitability and soon after and its worth remembering that even a hateful emotional attachment is top of mind when stuck at 57.4 GB. Don't be fooled by the sly bear saying the company is going bankrupt they have more then enough cash to see them through until Sherms strategy plays itself out or they eventually kick him out for failing at his job.   ## But what about the revenue miss and the stores closing how can that possibly be bullish? or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sherman.  Prior to shutting the stores GME was everywhere and had infested malls to the point of absurd inefficiency. There was a point where within the small mall there were multiple gamestops that were essentially competing with each other. As it is physical stores are ridiculously expensive to run. A good action to take in when you have too many stores and there is a shift online would be to close down unneeded stores and focus more on online shopping. And guess what? Thats exactly what the Sherm omniclose strat is all about. That's why when people say that closing 1000 stores is bullish, that while yes it will drop revenue, it will also allow Gamestop to focus more intently on profitable stores and Ecommerce.   Then there is the shift towards a greater product line like console accessories, gaming headsets and focused advertising. This is part of building an experiential service that will be a league against companies like amazon that can't customize for hardcore gamers who lets face it are fanatics when it comes to their genre of choice. Despite Sherms shitty corporate speak they are actually somewhat following Cohens letter just on Boomer time.   ## Beyond the Cohen rainbow  We should all be aware of Cohen at this point. But there are actually more big dogs then Cohen and Burry betting that GME is going to turn around. What I've seen missing is Daniel Foss the billionaire and Senvest who ""employs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy "" or specialize in underdogs due for a comeback. Why would they do that? because they also see the big opportunity of a Gamestop turn around with sensible fiscal management and a turn towards being a multi product eCommerce store. So you're not alone in your holdings and its backed by some very big players in the game.   ## Where this leaves us?  So even ignoring the Ryan Cohen X factor, the short squeeze, and the other X factors this stock is a total value play. There is some much more detailed posts out there, notably the [infinity war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) post that dives into the numbers also worth a look at is [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) profile and associated accounts you can find on his profile. The additional X factors that could take this from a strong value play to an actual lottery ticket is Cohen and the infamous short squeeze but thats a story for another day.   The Tl:dr is People still buy physical games, PS5 has limited space so yes physical disks aren't going away this console cycle. GME is shifting into bigger product categories, and they are backed by serious money. If you want to listen to Uberkiks11 go further into depth into the history of GME and the intricacies of this play you can listen and frankly do a much better job then this rough summary you can hear him in [full here](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6)  Positions: 2122 shares in GME $13.87 cost basis and more when I can."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1710655|public|confidence|self|||GME DD crossing the Shermancon edition.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keup2z/gme_dd_crossing_the_shermancon_edition/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'c1xfqXSBHj4RQ9DE0EWILmkgXzc-nX0lEuk91PkhY_g', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8NntGFU131ar5o7cHuSjeUaEMVP5jp3ayRD9KUvpkgs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddfc412d85c7f434422e55c553c7f86446de32f', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8NntGFU131ar5o7cHuSjeUaEMVP5jp3ayRD9KUvpkgs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c4e874daed27f753f8dac719c49b1566e386d42', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8NntGFU131ar5o7cHuSjeUaEMVP5jp3ayRD9KUvpkgs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f7cb5478725ea0d92682e6dadb2c8ce69a22227', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 400, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8NntGFU131ar5o7cHuSjeUaEMVP5jp3ayRD9KUvpkgs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a6e1a02b0f7e18c7e7e8621f6bba2162271f9b57', 'width': 400}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||

Everyone who tuned into the earnings call last week was annoyed that GME management did not even comment on Cohen's now-infamous letter. However, listening to Ackman talking about activist investing at [6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGatQk1JSas&amp;t=420s) does shed a bit of light onto why this is.   Ackman says that often companies will refuse to comment on activist investor requests. If the management directly comments on a proposal, then event-driven investors (like 90% of the autists here) will buy in in droves. If this happens and there is a proxy contest down the line, the activist investor will win as he/she will be backed by the event-driven investors. i.e. George Sherman didn't comment on Cohen, as he doesn't want to lose his job.  Anyone with half a brain cell probably realised from the earnings call, especially with the option for GME to issue more shares, that they are scared of a takeover. That's why we heard 'omnichannel' a trillion times, to suggest that GME are shifting to e-commerce without directly talking about Cohen's strategy.  Lastly, it has been noted here a few times that GME won't need to use the shelved shares. Gamestop is currently sitting on $500 million cash and so just don't need the extra capital. They will only exercise the right if they spot a Cohen hostile takeover, meaning it won't affect the share price greatly.   Remember it's also Q4 earnings, not Q3, that matter.

This post will setup my framework and over the next few days I'm going to be posting my DDs on the stocks I've invested in if there is interest.  # TLDR: I am FULLY SENDING IT - below is WHY.  **Aphorism 1:** ""STONKS only go up"" - WSB legends  * I am a true believer of things improving over time. My plays are stocks and leaps due to tax advantages and frankly the humility that came along with trying to time the top/bottom and failing on multiple occasions.  **Aphorism 2:** ""History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."" - Mark Twain  * What are the top 3 countries with the lowest interest rates?    * Switzerland: maintained the same interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EWL ETF over those 5 years? 10% with 61% total return.    * Denmark: maintained 0% to negative \~1% interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EDEN ETF over those 5 years? 12.78% with 82.43% total return.    * Japan: has been fucked for a long time, everybody knows it. EVENTHOUGH FUCKED - annualized return of EWJ over the past 5 years? 8.22% with 48.46% total return. * The Federal Reserve indicates it will not raise rates for years. It will leave the interest rates around 0% until 2023. What does this mean? Long equity, any equity and if you want to short something don't short fucking TESLA short BANKS. My favorite bank to short is Goldman Sachs, because I like Bernard Baruch not a retard that calls himself DJ Sol.  **Aphorism 3:** ""The odds are either 100% or 0%, and we just don't know which."" - one of my legendary friends  * The fundamental risk at the moment is, the FED's statement of keeping interest rates low is not binding. I am betting that they will stay at 0% but again the statement is NOT BINDING.

The issue was between porches' current Volkswagen stake (will not sell, will only acquire more), the institutional investors stake (will not sell), and index funds (will not sell), the shorts were out of luck.  In the GME scenario, there are those sitting at 600% profit from buying GME at $2-3 who will take their profits at every opportunity. Another group is those who bought at the top and will likely sell near breakeven to mitigate their loss. The last group is the speculators who just want to make their money and get out.

Fuck me right ?   GME is at **12.38** right now as I'm writing this. I'm trying to figure out what to do now, since I went all IN. And I mean all IN - got no money to invest on any other plays anymore.  I originally got into GME a couple of days before their Q2 earnings. I bought 30c's for 1/15/21 after reading one of the first DDs about the squeeze. Q2 earnings happened, and they got killed, and I panic sold my calls at a loss. And decided not to fuck with GME again.   Made some money on other plays over the months, until the squeeze hype train ran into me, and I decided to YOLO everything into GME, at an average of 18.03, and the ride has just been downhill ever since.  Q3 earnings of course did not lead us anywhere. And today morning, a week later, GME is down to a sad 12.38. Don't I feel like quite the bag holder.   It seems like every one has a better position than I do (tons of comments from people who got in when it was in single digits, or at around 12-13). But there have to be others like me, who're stuck at an average that seems unsurmountable right now.   Is the plan to just wait till Q4 earnings ? Is there any hope of Daddy Cohen intervening ? Seems like the board has started cutting costs by shutting stores, something that Cohen wanted them to do. My fear is that Sherman might half arse this enough to avoid being taken over, and we're left with this stock that just won't move. Although honestly I don't fully understand the technicals of the squeeze, so I'm sure there are factors beyond these.  Every time I try asking about these doubts I have on /r/wsb, the answer I've received is that I should hold. And hold I will, as I watch all you autists make money on other plays like PLTR and god knows what.  Look momma didn't raise no paper handed bitch, I've got diamond hands. What I don't got, are diamond balls, and so I'm looking for some support, perhaps some confirmation bias, some guidance ? Anyway, thought I'd create a post where we GME autists can support each other.  Anyone else feel like they're on the same boat ?

I'm not going to bother with the niceties since most of you have the attention span of a pre-teen needing to go potty. That's not a lot so I'll keep it brief.  &amp;#x200B;  GME is a B&amp;M primary business, first and foremost. It operates mainly in the US, though it also has retail stores in Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. They used to be wildly popular back in the day, but have seen rapid decline since the digitization era has come and GME for the most part hasn't been adapting as it should have been.      This brings us to today, where the share price has been averaging down for years, until mid-August this year when we got the news of the [partnership with Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-surges-after-microsoft-partnership-announcement-2020-10-08#:~:text=GME%2C%20%2D5.74%25%20gained%2044,end%20and%20in%2Dstore%20operations), which sent the price to tendie-town for those who got in early. However, based on purely DCF, a fair value for the stock would be around 22 USD. Way higher than what it's now, and that's also the difference between Burry and Cohen imo. Burry invested purely on the fair value for GME, while Cohen has different intentions (more on that later).  Now, a partnership is great, but it won't keep them afloat forever. They NEED to change their boomer mentality and start getting digitized. Gaming is a booming sector, [with insane growth YOY.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20game%20market,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027.&amp;text=The%20rising%20inclination%20from%20physical,on%20hardware%20compatibility%20and%20efficiency) They need to capitalize on this or they'll flicker out eventually because someone else came around and filled the void.   This is where Ryan Cohen comes in. No need to introduce him, this guy has been mentioned enough, founded CHEWY made millions, etc. What hasn't been sent home enough, is that he has vision. He knows what people want, how they want to be treated as customers ([which is in part why CHWY has such good reputability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronikasonsev/2018/05/23/chewys-customers-love-them-and-heres-why/?sh=58b595244b7f)).   What the gaming industry lacks is a centralized point that makes people go ""Oh yeah, I need this or that game, let's go to Gamestop for that"" There really isn't that one name for people. It used to BE Gamestop with them even now still being the largest gaming retailer in America. But they're but a shadow of what they have been.   Now if anyone has been able to follow me through my ramblings, Ryan Cohen has in front of him an opportunity to pull GME up from the mud and reveal a diamond. Because that what GME is. A diamond in the rough, and no one's noticed, or bothered to check it out.   Now I don't know how, or when exactly, there are plenty of other posts that go into the when and how Cohen will take over, but all I do know is this:  \-He bought up 9.98% of the shares outstanding (massive position)  \-He ([or his lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/)) wrote an unusually aggressive letter to the BoD to change pretty massively.   \-He's mentioned in interviews that he doesn't like to half-ass investments if he [""believes in the company""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJdZPTjq274).   &amp;#x200B;  What does this say for me? That he believes in the company, not so much in the current way that its heading (hence the letter). His stake in the company tells me he's not just a friendly passer-by telling them to look-up because a meteorite is about to smash into them. No, he's putting his foot in the door so that he can then open it wide and let in some fresh air (himself/his team).   Not only would it change the entire company in a good way, it would make any sort of valuation unpredictable taking into account future potential.   Add on to this situation that GME is so heavily shorted, and this makes for a SUPER interesting play, if not long-term, at the very least short-term, because of the short squeeze that would occur because of this. And if Cohen takes over, long term prospects are probably higher than whatever we get from the squeeze.   I don't know if much of what I said made sense, but here you go anyway. My 2 cents.  &amp;#x200B;  Positions are 1000 shares @$16.33 - It's not whale size, but I don't have much money to start with.

Also, NZ has no covid so can shop safely without masks etc).   Anyway, I think I see exactly what Cohen sees in GME; it's a gaming culture brand for consoles and PCs that also serves fandom merch. It just works cause there's nothing like it in the market. It's a fun place and a good brand. It's one of the only places where everything is kinda fun and as a huge pokemon fan, im not really served otherwise except for target clones which draws the life out of you shopping in.   The good news was the console sales. I chatted to a rep acting interested in a ps5. She told me there is a backlog of PS5s and Xboxs. NZ will prob get 10k max at EB games then will have to wait for the next shipment. I cannot order a PS5 until January and even then March and April is more likely. Shit is real. And EB Games (GME) is seen as a market leader in the NZ market. She said xbox didnt even have a date in nz. Gotta love hype.   Im buying more of this dip. Have a Wendy's worker's size of stock atm.

The only downside seems to be if there's a significant crash in the underlying (eg AAPL suddenly drops to 110 and doesnt recover before the long calls expire), you're effectively making the % returns based on the premium of the long call rather than the actual share price (0.5/27.3 vs 1.25/124).   &amp;#x200B;  so even if I can afford 100 shares of a company to do covered calls, why would I do that instead of PMCC? what am I missing?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1694213|public|confidence|self|||Someone please explain to me why I would not use poor mans covered calls for theta gang?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kc28c7/someone_please_explain_to_me_why_i_would_not_use/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Lower store base and lower store operating days contributed to same-store sales down 12.7% in the second quarter.  “The second quarter saw strong progress toward our strategic initiatives, fueling an 800% increase in global e-commerce sales, a $133.7 million reduction in SG&amp;A and a significant improvement in our balance sheet with $735.1 million in cash at quarter-end,” CEO George Sherman said.  Quarterly losses of $1.40 per share missed the analyst consensus estimate by 37 cents.  # Why It’s Important: E-commerce growth of 800% year over year was the bright spot in the quarter and represented 20% of total net sales. GameStop was able to see 90% fulfillment rates within 24 hours of customer orders.  # [What does this mean for me?

ALL ON PAPA ELON.  Let me set the stage for you--&gt;  I'm balls deep in TSLA calls, one sweet SPY put and you know damn straight I'm GME gang till I fucking die. #WEWANTCOHEN  Here's the spread:  TSLA:  12/18 $450 call +3  12/18 $610 call +2   12/24 $545 call +1  12/24 $520 call +1  1/15 $500 call +2  9/16/22 $300 call +1  SPY:  12/28 $335 put +23  Now I pull out my massive paintbrush. This is how I see it, it literally CAN NOT GO TITS UP. (Famous last words? TBD). there's 3  likely outcomes.  \#1. \[75% chance dubbed the Baseline\] Due to the massive demand from benchmark funds and tracking funds alike having to buy a little over 164 MILLION SHARES Tesla fucking skyrockets to 750 minimum by Friday 12/18. ( A 23.1527% increase) I sell everything friday, Take my money and leave the poker table  after calling their bluffs, \*cough pussies cough\*, and head over to and put it all on black GME for the win. (long fucking wait though its going to be bouncing around till April). Oh also the Spy calls expire worthless, but in reality who gives a fuck?  \#2. \[12.5% chance dubbed the Black swan\] Due to some unforeseen event. Tesla tanks despite the massive demand and buying pressure leading into Friday the 18th, but somehow the general market is largely unaffected and doesn't trigger my 8% hail merry FT(motherfucking)W spy puts and I lose everything. I then look longing at the closet, as i open the door to see my day 1, $rope, and flip a coin to see if today is the day.   \#3\[12.5% chance dubbed the golden goose\] Due to unforeseen event the psychology of the market takes a massive shit on itself from rebalancing portfolios and algorithmic bot traders proceed to shit the bed and dump all other stocks besides tesla and the market sees a massive +10% drop while TSLA, un wavered by the fools who thought technology could save it reaches to Mars because the moon was just too damn close. This triggers not only my spy puts raking in boat loads of cash but also sending my TSLA shares and options threw the proverbial roof. I also sell here and go see my boy #WEWANTCOHEN and proceed to take over the Gamestop board to help captain turn this bitchin' ship around.  So 1) Tesla's meteoric rise is taken into account. 2) if i shit the bed or market tanks and effects tesla i still profit. and 3) there's always the good ol' $Rope theory i hear so much about. I Literally cant see how this can all go tits up. With impending government lockdowns, fed programs ending, Jpow turning the printer off, the stimulus on hold, and all eviction memorandums coming up the end of December, its looking really good for a nice lil correction.  Now, i know what you fucktards are going to say. ""why so deep in the money? if you believe TSLA is hitting 700 minimum Friday, why so much capital upfront?""  Answer: Because all of this isn't just for fun, i like to manage my risk. Because WINNING is much more important to me than loss porn. if any issues see Link #3.  or Maybe the good old ""why are you buying so many different strikes?""  answer: different strikes bought on different days and different accounts and I'm still learning/adapting.  I'm going to do the DD post with the same name and tittle is part [2. So](https://2.So) am i missing anything?   TLDR: TSLA GO MARS FRIDAY. HOLD CALLS TILL FRIDAY. GROFIT.

Since logic no longer applies with trading in 2020, why not like RNGesus help? This is a quick python script I put together that takes a list of tickers and generates some random options to help you lose your money without guilt. If you lose money with these trades, you can blame RNG instead of yourself! If you're feeling even more adventurous, there's an FD mode too!  **DISCLAIMER**  This script is purely for entertainment purposes and I will be not responsible for any losses your retarded plays get you!!   **How it works**   More details available in the README in the Github repo, but here's the gist of it. You feed it a list of tickers you want to ""invest"" in. For each one, it randomly decides whether to make a call/put, selects a random expiration date and strike price and returns the relevant data. The script uses a library that uses the Yahoo Finance API for data which is limited to 1000 API calls per hour per IP address.  Activating FD mode restricts the returned options to those that are &lt;2 weeks and 3-5 strikes OTM only. Otherwise by default, you have a chance of OTM, ATM, and ITM  options.  **Setup and Usage**   You'll need Python 3.6+ installed. Download requirements.txt and wsbroulette.py from the Github repo. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you downloaded the files and install the requirements using      pip install -r requirements.txt      Script Usage:      python wsbroulette.py -t TICKERS -b BALANCE [-e EXPIRATION RANGE] [-s STRIKE_RANGE] [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-f]      Enter the list of tickers in parantheses and seperated by commas. Ex. ""TSLA,GME,ROPE""  Balance is the maximum amount of $ you want to spend  EXPIRATION_RANGE is optional and controls what the maximum number of expiration dates are returned (Default = 4)  STRIKE_RANGE is optional and controls the range of strikes returned from the current underlying price (Default = 3)  DISTRIBUTION is optional and controls the randomness of allocation of funds between the tickers (Lower is more random, Higher is more even, Default = 10)  Add the -f flag if you want to engage FD mode! In FD mode, only the next 2 expiration dates are used. Options are also always OTM at 3-5 strikes out from underlying.    **Example Usage**      python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -e 2 -s 5  This generates 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a total bankroll of up to $50,000. It will only use up to the next 2 expirations because FDs are life. The strike price will be in the range of +/- 5 strikes from the current underyling price.      python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -f  FD MODE! Generate 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a bankroll of $50k. Options are OTM, expire within 2 weeks and are 3-5 strikes out.  **Screenshot**   https://i.ibb.co/wcc144P/image.png   **Source and Download**   https://github.com/r34p3rex/wsb-roulette"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1692920|public|confidence|self|||Introducing WSB Roulette!

He has been in the cosmetic industry for decades and he knows his shit, certainly wouldn’t have picked HydraFacial unless the product was legit. He and Cramer are legitimately best buds...you'll want to get in before the inevitable Cramer pump. They are forking over $460M and leading a $350M PIPE to buy HydraFacial at a $1.1B valuation.  **Financials**  HydraFacial makes money selling both the dispensers for the system which lasts 7 years and makes up 49% of revenue, and the other 51% of revenue is the single-use serums.  In 2019 they were at $167M of revenue with 52% CAGR, and $41M EBITDA with 38% CAGR. Margins are around 20%-25%. They're targeting $250M in rev in 2022. This deal will give them an extra $100M of cash on the balance sheet and get their debt down to $0. That's right, **this is a profitable SPAC with $0 in debt**  **Growth Opportunity**  This thing is primed for growth in the next 5-10 years. They're already growing at over 50% YOY and were able to have record deliveries even in the middle of COVID when a lot of salons were closed.  They don't just have market share...they ARE the market. They have created this category in the beauty industry. They are the ""Kleenex"" of this industry; HydraFacial is now both their brand and synonymous for the process of hydrating facial treatment. They have 38 patents on their products so that they will continue to corner this market as it grows.  The youngins fucking love this treatment. They have a massive social media presence (\~$2.3B media impressions, 16% instagram engagement rate). About 50%-60% of their users are millennials, and the average user gets 4 treatments per year. Just like botox, this is a recurring treatment with recurring revenue for HydraFacial. As influencers and social media keeps making us look at ourselves in a camera...these products are going to be needed.  Oh yeah, did I mention they're in 87 counties?! Their biggest market is the US, but they are predicting a much larger and faster growth in the Asia market.  **Valuation**  This deal sits them at *$1.1B, about 4.6x 2022 revenue*. Yeah that's high, but so is this goddamn market. Shit, Nikola pushed a truck down a hill and QS hasn't built a goddamn thing yet and they're worth billions. This market wants future growth, and this company has plenty it.  It's hard to get an exact comparable valuation since they are a new player in a new market. If we're going with the Becky market they are massively undervalued compared to their peers and they have better growth:  (Align 9.0x rev, LULU 6.9X rev, L' Oreal 5.3x rev, Estee Lauder 5.2x rev).  I own a large amount of $ALGN which popped over 100% just because some TikTokers use their product. LULU and PTON...huge becky stocks that are crushed during the pandemic. This is all the new rage with the younger female generation and this is the ALGN of skincare.  **What's the play?**  Fuck can't believe you read this far. This is a SPAC. SPAC market has been retarded lately, nothing but moons. Wall Street hasn't caught up to this one yet because its not an EV SPAC. If you don't know how SPACs work...learn how to Google things, but essentially they all start at $10/share and have a $10 floor. That's right, you CAN'T GO BELOW $10. This offers an insanely low risk for a SPAC that is going to take off.  The stock (or ""commons"") are trading at $10.65...offering a very low downside. Even better, the warrants (essentially a call option for SPACs) are trading at $2 which is stupid cheap for a SPAC that's announced a target. Warrants are more volatile but offer a ton of upside. I set a limit at $2 today and it fucking hit. I can't believe I got them that cheap.  These warrants WILL hit $3 easy as they get closer to their merger. This one will start to get more attention and start to climb, and I'll be at $3 or probably closer to $4 or $5 in a month. Like I said, Cramer fucking LOVES this CEO and will 100% have him on Mad Money to jerk this thing higher. You'll want to get in on these warrants before that happens.  **Buy VSPR or VSPRW (warrants) and thank me when you're rich.**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1691470|public|confidence|self|||$VSPR HydraFacial - Major Becky Stock + Undervalued SPAC set to 🚀|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbgmo1/vspr_hydrafacial_major_becky_stock_undervalued/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

The liquidity programs we've come to know and love--the true ""pumps""—are stagnating or contracting, and it's clear SPY doesn't like this.  We are our own out there people. Let me break down for you how and why that is; and what we can do to save our tendies.  *First, let’s take a quick look at the vehicles that the FED has used to keep us propped up that I’m referencing:*  **Overnight short-term loans (Repo, Reverse Repo operations)** *What It Is* [More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money. [‘0 basis points over IOER’ is nerd speak for ‘fucking free money’](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg) **-Did it work?  Yes.**   Fed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring. [look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)  **Treasuries**  I won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks. **-Did it work? Yes**. Take a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks. ""How do you know this was the Fed's doing?"" They said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying ""we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID"".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip. [treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)  **Bond Repurchases** In March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get. **Did it work? Yes**.  See: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.  *So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What’s the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*  **Because the Fed’s balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn’t strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**  [here’s a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg) The FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven’t been increased.* **a) Repo operations haven’t been at a lower cost interest level since July**, from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts. **b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts. **c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)  **What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on their own to continue its rise.  If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**  Why did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two options: **1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.  **2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).  **So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying “where was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY”** -[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Tuesday saying not to go near SPY without a stimulus -[heres my tweet](https://twitter.com/yourboymilt/status/1336366986545098752?s=21) from last week calling the top of SPY at 370 To be fair, I'm wrong a fucking ton, as we all are lol. but gotta flx those few sweet moments you get it right.  **Positions:** TLT is my new hedge against SPY because VIX and its derivatives are ass rn. I dont buy puts cuz im not sweet like that.  (here's my[ DD on VIX 101 if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)) Other than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope.   **WMT: 1/8 155c** **TGT: 1/8 180c** **TDOC 11/24 200c** **TDOC 1/15 205c** **AAPL: 1/8 126c** **HPQ: 1/15 25c** **TOL 1/15 46c**   **TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is toodangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winnersin preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.

Despite some recovery this year, GME is a company that has been failing despite CAGR of 12.1% over the course of the past 5 years in gaming. Now you may ask, why the fuck would GameStop fail despite such strong growth in gaming. I’ll tell you why. THEY BUTTFUCK THEMSELVES ON REAL ESTATE EXPENSES. On top of that they were a laggard in adopting a robust e-commerce platform, making them lose market share. In a 10 mile radius from my home there is 13 GameStop stores, and I’m certain this story is true for many different parts of the US.   Now you might argue that this is precisely what makes GME attractive. Ryan Cohen is going to come in and shit on the whole board and we’ll be seeing 🚀 for days. Unfortunately, this isn’t that simple. Even with 10% ownership in GME, it’s pretty difficult for someone like Cohen to come in and conduct a hostile takeover, and it’s definitely not quick. Instead, let me make a quick and simple proposal to those of you who love Cohen.  Invest in CHWY. This is the best e-commerce play available in the market in my opinion. We saw a great earnings report last week detailing how CHWY has managed to improve margins, grow its customer base, and launch a new Telehealth platform for pets. Despite all this it’s only trading at about 6 times sales. LET ME REITERATE THAT IN CAPS FOR THOSE NOT PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. CHWY IS ONLY TRADING AT ABOUT 6 TIMES SALES.   You might argue that the most directly comparable company, AMZN, trades at 4.5 times sales. And I would argue that CHWY is growing at a much faster pace. And with introduction of pet telehealth, we should see stronger growth within a seemingly new and disruptive sector that has emerged since the introduction.   CONCLUSION/TLDR;  If you want to suck Cohen’s dick, suck it through CHWY, not GME dumbasses.

TL:DR ALL IN GME  GME earnings was largely a bull case for those following WSB's DD, but we've seen shares slide down. One of the main reasons is the potential dilution of shares from the shelf offering. People have explained that it's an offering of $100mil worth of shares, not actually 100mil shares but no one gave any numbers. Turns out I'm the only one out here with a TI-84 Plus CE.

TL:DR ALL IN GME  GME earnings was largely a bull case for those following WSB's DD, but we've seen shares slide down. One of the main reasons is the potential dilution of shares from the shelf offering. People have explained that it's an offering of $100mil worth of shares, not actually 100mil shares but no one gave any numbers. Turns out I'm the only one out here with a TI-84 Plus CE.   Based on the market cap before earnings call and a conservative estimate of 10mil shares offered at $10 share price.  16.94 x 69750000 / 79750000 = 14.82 (2d.p)  Based on share dilution alone, the stock would only dip to 14.82 on very conservative assumptions.

This survey is mainly for those who responded to the first survey before Q3 earnings. Only entries where the ID matches an ID from the first survey will be counted.  The preliminary results from the post-earnings responses to the first survey are extremely bullish.

But this post, it still isn’t useless now. Have a read you all.  Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.  # The case for a squeeze:  The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.  **In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)  This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.  Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.  [It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&amp;location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&amp;placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&amp;facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)  It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)  Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.  Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.  It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.  Why would it be inevitable?  [Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)  GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.  The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)  But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.  [Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.  The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.  **Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.  Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.  This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.  **Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.  It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.  [Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.  **Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.  But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).  **Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.  # The Case For Bankruptcy  The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.  As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.  After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.  The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.  Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).  Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.  Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)  Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.  While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.  To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.  GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.  Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.  Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.  Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.  After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.  They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn’t give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.  Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.  # Conclusion  The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.      If     ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""          Else If     ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""          Else If     ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important          Else If     ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""          Else If     ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""          Else     ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)  # Disclaimer  There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research.

I also enjoy my GME porn to have a good story to it and I think I've crafted an enjoyable scene here  If I was Ryan Cohen, which tahnkfully for all of u I'm not because I'd burn this company to the ground faster than General Sherman, the last step to me trying to take over would be gobbling as many voting shares as I can. He's worth 600 mil, presumably not all liquid, but he also stopped right at 9.9% ownership because he's leaving the option open of going over 10% (or at least the impression of it). If he ticks over 10% he has 10 days to report and file. What I would do if I were him is I would plan my 10 days of purchases around earnings because that's when volume is the highest. Not only that, but that is when call option liquidity is the highest. There is 5 million worth of shares (50k call contracts) from current price to 20 strike expiring tm. There is 3 million worth of shares (30k contracts) expiring next week. He's not gonna be able to buy that many of the calls without giving away his move but again what I would do is buy as many of those as I could before I fire my final bullet to buy as much of GME as I can. Then, if I drive the price of GME over the strikes of calls that I own that works out because I'll just exercise and own even more GME. Again it's well over 10% of the float that is in calls expiring in the next 6 days up to the 20 stirke, idk how much of that he can buy without showing his hand but it's definitely going to be a helpful amount of voting power if he's really trying to pull off this take over.  Looked up what 10 days before tomorrow looked like, it was the Friday before the Monday that we gapped up 20% so there was definitely a lot of buying pressure there. GME is on, maybe. Lots of volume thru earnings as expected. Shorts definitely came through as we can see with the borrow rate spiking, price dropped 20% but I've seen intraday swings of 20% with what looked like less shorting pressure..is there buying pressure?  If I'm a speculator looking for a Ryan Cohen take over, I'm going to pay careful attention to the price action tomorrow morning. If I see a lot of early volume in the calls and then buying in the morning (buying has to start in the morning IMO coz that's when volume is highest and heavy buying can be a little more hidden) then the play is to yeet a bullet into way OTM calls expiring tm.

I've been getting off from the sidelines with the meme/videos/comment gold and now I hope to return the favor.  Many of us were cucked into oblivion from GME ER (I actually liked the call, bagholding into bankruptcy) and watched G L S I pump into another galaxy.   I know someone who got in on the action today at $26 that called out another run that I plan to sIMMP for tomorrow. I don't know how to draw any of the squiggly lines or get into the financials as to why a company without revenue is worth a bazillion dollars, but I do trust the recommendations of this particular person. No they are not on WSB, my wife's bull's bosses' sister just really knows her shit. But it was described to me as a ""sympathy"" play and I do have some pics to back up why that might make sense, PLUS:  Symp = sIMMP = ROCKET   In true aut form I only read about half of the article and to be clear it sounds like the trial results only prove to extend a patient's life, not prevent their death entirely. I wasn't even planning on posting this until I saw there wasn't a single mention in this thread, only a couple in some of the boomer threads. Check ST to verify the sentiment and if you have any doubts just look at the pump our criminal spawn friends are seeing down under right now.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/5bs2ro07ma461.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2decd98af57e47b684ccc3107056841857b4f37  Someone said something about the trials reports not being thorough enough.  DOES THAT MATTER TO US? WE ARE THE 5TH LARGEST SHAREHOLDER OF GME, WE CAN PUMP THIS PIECE OF TIN CAN TRASH TO THE MOON!   Looks like it pumped here AH but came back down? Maybe someone higher on the spectrum can explain why to us. Here's a link to the thread with some data points that I don't understand.

Might even be cool to get some of that shiny flair stuff I see sometimes? I hear you can trade it for OTM weeklies on RH.  Positions: Boomer Stonks (no options)  P.S. If you still feel I don't belong here just know that I recently took out a $15k personal loan to pay of my existing 401k loan so that I could then take out another larger 401k loan (company only allows one at a time)."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1682774|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XqU-RuhvZDD52L2mTDnZpkEswyz89uo3ROqPL0dKUxs.jpg|80.0|140.0|F ind O ther M arket O pportunities - sIMMPs Unite!|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ka9a6u/f_ind_o_ther_m_arket_o_pportunities_simmps_unite/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'lGh7VS_jRjByicMJkAMwkwWvAsNmn88lkkYKqIE0_ho', 'resolutions': [{'height': 45, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QDeLLbdUlbuwPj3oXuFxq91LSCfOq7TDCeXRURMZcg0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5bf8e200a14a988845198e9dc13ee7273a4d553', 'width': 108}, {'height': 90, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QDeLLbdUlbuwPj3oXuFxq91LSCfOq7TDCeXRURMZcg0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699509c49ea23b73c04d75aef0694968fa392597', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 103, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QDeLLbdUlbuwPj3oXuFxq91LSCfOq7TDCeXRURMZcg0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=855ea9c1c96a340ddbf12e7a0777d4f9dcb4a474', 'width': 246}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||

In that same timeframe, that same roughly 24-month timeframe, plus or minus, we also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So, I think -- look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility.

I will start off with a brief intro into BF, then I will list off some emotional and cognitive biases that retail investors are notorious for exhibiting. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will become more self-aware of what you are doing and become that much closer to someone that doesn’t lose his rent money on a regular basis.   **What is Behavioral Finance (BF)**  To put it in simplest terms, BF attempts to understand and explain observed investor and market behaviors.   You are all familiar with traditional, neo-classical finance where it assumes investors are risk-averse (lol), maximize utility (level of satisfaction received from the consumption of goods and services), and the markets are efficient in every single way. BF essentially says that’s all bullshit because in reality, people are seldom rational and cannot possibly consider all available information when making a decision, therefore, the markets are not efficient at all.   To put it in layman’s terms, just like two wrongs don’t make a right, BF states that stuffing a million retards on Robinhood doesn’t make an Einstein.   **Emotional Bias**  1. Loss Aversion Bias: People tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to gains. This will cause people to hold on to failing securities. This is a big one on this sub. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for strong hands and all but recognize when you’re in a bad play and don’t be afraid to get out.   2. Overconfidence Bias: Unwarranted faith in their own intuitive reasoning, judgement, and cognitive ability. This is a big one and is shown every time someone yolo their life savings on far OTM options.   3. Self-Control Bias: Failure to act in pursuit of their long-term goals due to a lack of self-discipline. This is anyone in GME gang that paper handed and sold at open without realizing that the long term play is to bank on this company turning around starting in 20Q4 and triggering a short squeeze.   4. Status Quo Bias: Doing nothing instead of making a change. Example are those that never closed their TSLA puts.   5. Regret-Aversion Bias: Avoid making decisions that will result in action out of fear that decision will turn out poorly. Stop being a pussy.   **Cognitive Errors**  1. Cognitive Dissonance: mental discomfort that occurs when new information conflicts with previously held beliefs. This is shown when people only notice information that confirm existing biases and ignore conflicting points of view.   2. Conservation Bias: People maintain prior views by inadequately incorporating new information. Will often result in being too slow to update their viewpoints and end up bag holding major losses. A good example are those that diamond handed SPY puts in March.   3. Confirmation Bias: people only look for and notice what confirms their own beliefs and ignore those that contradict. An example can be virtually any “gang” that existed in WSB history. Tanker gang, silver gang, etc.   4. Representativeness Bias: people classify new information based on past experience and not realize that just because something happened in the past does not mean it is repeating itself right now. An example can be anytime someone compares the March crash to 08 or 1929.   5. Anchoring Bias: Use of a psychological heuristic that influences the way people estimate probabilities. This is every time someone says stocks are at an ATH, why should I buy? Without looking at the fundamentals that drove the stock there to begin with  6. Mental Accounting Bias: Treating one sum of money differently to another equal sum. Money is money, get over it.   7. Framing Bias: answering a question differently based on way it is asked.   8. Availability Bias: people take a heuristic approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily outcome comes to mind. Everytime stocks dip 5-7% I guarantee you there will be posts saying the crash is here simply because people can easily remember March.   **Conclusion**  In conclusion, before making a decision, ask yourself if any of these biases apply to you. If so, you are probably not thinking straight and acting like a total retard. All of these biases can be countered by having a clear head, understand your risk tolerance and return objectives, and having a clear long term strategy.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1680886|public|confidence|self|||Behavioral Finance: You’re Retarded Explained|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zxon/behavioral_finance_youre_retarded_explained/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Retard management came out and said they will issue 100mln$ stocks while BRAGGING about buybacks in the same call. This does not get more retarded than this. Anyways, let's focus on a few issues here, and then everyone can make their own mind. First of all, I have not Yoloed on this thing, in fact, it is around 1% of my portfolio (still sizable 1%) and the reason I got in this thing is due to 2 things. in the short term, short squeeze (probability of this happening diminished since yesterday), long term, GME realized they have missed the boat of the e-commerce world and trying to catch up to it (retards don't even have an app for God's sake!. )   If someone listened to the latest call, there are few things that popped up, good and bad.   The bad is their YoY comp sales are in decline - they blame Covid closures for that which is reasonable I would say considering they got closed, but Walmart and BestBuy did not. This was an unfair game for GME (but they compensated on online sales for some of it). The good news is they are getting rid of stores that are unprofitable, reducing their brick and mortar exposure, they are working on fixing their balance sheet, have increased the cash they hold, reduction in debt, inventory management, etc. (don't remind me here share issuance!) But what I didn't hear much is what they are doing on the Online front (again, where is the goddamn app?). Plus they have been doing share buybacks and paying dividends meaning the company does not know how to build a new growing company. This is troubling news IMO. returning money to shareholders for the troubling company should be the last resort when you don't know what else to do with money, how to scale.  My honest take from current management is they are genuine at fixing GME, and doing what they think is the best for the comp while almost missing the E-COM Train (they have grabbed from the side of the train but can't catch up fast to jump in it, still running by its side - just like in the movies )    Ok now, whether GME will be able to get back to its feet is unknown even for the management, but what should I do with my investment? A short squeeze might still happen but as mentioned earlier, unless GME makes a significant rocket jump, that dream is gone. And the reason I have been posting this is that I see lots of autists here holding the bag just like me and thinking everything will be fine (I can't help if you bought options, this is for shareowners) So there are few behavioral biases (cognitive errors) I have become a victim of and definitely so have you - overconfidence bias, confirmation bias, conservatism bias. (I highly recommend you Google these).  Final thought, GME is in real trouble, brick, and mortar is almost dead, management returns money to shareholders meaning, they are basically selling/returning the company piece by piece.

What is the latest news on Apple and the new AirPods Max? Should we buy AirBNB or DoorDash when they launch tomorrow? Let’s talk about this and more about the stock market**  Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/8zQQ165) leading the way up half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9pFmQ0X) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqM) also up .35% to close Tuesday. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MPVyNn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. This moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/Lnr5Q3X) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. Things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. So, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4LYBk9) Mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.  We saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/R9N61kK) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in November as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and 200-day moving averages. The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/hLpbcrx) yesterday were Energy and Health Care while Real Estate and Utilities lagged behind as Large-Cap Growth companies were the only company factor [analysis](https://ibb.co/zbJd6m2) that lost ground yesterday, with small-caps, especially small-cap growth companies largely outperforming the markets.  You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hcMmt7x) that there were gains to be made yesterday in a lot of parts of the stock market, with only a few big red spots on the map.  [Today](https://ibb.co/RgSDj55) we will get some numbers on the November Job [openings](https://ibb.co/VLVz771), MBA mortgage applications and Petroleum inventories.   While we got some earnings yesterday from Chewy which dazzled again in [earnings](https://ibb.co/Jd7Scx1) with the only small miss coming in net sales per customer, but as the number of customers keeps increasing, this might continue to go down, as not every pet owner spends the same amount of big money on pets. The company [reported](https://ibb.co/WVndSgJ) an EBITDA of $5.5M vs a loss of over $9M expected with the gross margin increasing to over 25% while also giving great [guidance](https://ibb.co/h8BPK2W) for Q4 of $1.94B to $1.96B vs less than $1.8B expected by analysts.  The company also turned around to a positive [cash flow](https://ibb.co/ys3NVTc) of over $30M. I really like this company and I expected it to be a good own at least for the next quarter until they reach more hard earnings comps next year.  Meanwhile, as I expected GameStop had another bad [quarter](https://ibb.co/DWP4jZh) despite beating some earnings estimates with a smaller loss than expected, the revenue still continued to drop over 30% on a year over year basis while comps where even worse missing the expectations by quite a margin.   Though e-commerce sales rose by more than 250% in Q3, this did not offset the comparable store sales. Margins also declined with hardware margins being the biggest reasons why. I think this company has a very though challenge on its hands with e-commerce being such a though place to compete in, I think the shift to online has been delayed for this company and I think it will struggle to survive, even though it might see a boost next quarter from the sales of the new gaming consoles that were released last month from both Sony and Microsoft.  [GME EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS](https://ibb.co/SymxCtK)  I wouldn’t touch this [stock](https://ibb.co/K0cN5ds) as I think there are far better plays out there than betting on this struggling company.  The only company that I am interested today which will release earnings results is [ADOBE](https://ibb.co/d5SBbyX) which is expected to have the best results ever for the company with an increase of over 12% in both EPS and Revenues. Last go around despite posting great results, the stock fell more than 4% in September and have just recovered to that price point. I expect it this time to go higher and stay that way if they manage to deliver the best quarter on the books.  Meanwhile [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/FgJ5k7z) is pricing its initial public offering at over 100$/share which I believe is ridiculous, and it is an flat out joke of a valuation, this company has benefited a ton from this economy and still, this valuation implies that they will have over 50% of the total addressable market not in the US, but in the WORLD in the next couple of years, I don’t think this is a good investment opportunity, they will have increasing competition that offer the same thing for free or cheaper, this is a very though business to try and take over as one single company. People will also be way more likely to start going to restaurants maybe not in 2021 but for sure starting 2022 or whenever the vaccines are widely available in the entire world. I wouldn’t touch this stock at such high valuations, especially over 110$, even if I was looking for short-term gains which might end up being the case, I think there are better opportunities out there.  In contrast to DoorDash, I might be interested to buy some AirBNB if the price is right after the [IPO](https://ibb.co/RBDhWW0), I think it will have a much better future, as personally I really like to rent out apartments or homes whenever I go on a vacation rather than a traditional hotel. And even though it might have a tough Q4 and Q1 next year, I expect by Q2 next year more people will be vaccinated, so more people will start and go out and travel, and with especially low comps for next year as bookings are way down in 2020 this might make the company look much more attractive by this time next year. So, between DoorDash and AirBNB, I clearly like AirBNB a whole damn lot more.  In other IPO news, [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/WyJs5vQ) is expected to go public as soon as Q1 next year as they seek a valuation of over $20B.  Some other [Boeing](https://ibb.co/6rN04h6) came for companies like Boeing which made its first 737 MAX delivery since the ban ended, as it is expected to start rolling out deliveries and upgrades for current planes at a very good rate with more good news coming from the UK which will suspend the tariffs imposed on US Goods.  While [PENN](https://ibb.co/qJhKxGY) gaming ran to an all-time high yesterday after news that sports betting may be launched in Michigan as early as six weeks from now, as legalization of gambling is moving faster and faster in the US, this also bolds well for DraftKings and other gambling stocks.  Also, [ETSY](https://ibb.co/F0vsdmD) keeps getting upgrades from analysts as they are expected to have a great Q4 suggested from the most recent November sales data.  And finally let’s talk about Apple, as they just [revealed](https://ibb.co/dKrwT6j) the new AirPods Max headphone yesterday, with a huge price tag of 549$, this seemed to gain a pretty bad reaction from [consumers](https://ibb.co/CJ8DkLR) as [they](https://ibb.co/xz2HDXx) complained about the huge price tag with competitors like Bose and others selling similar headphones for 350$ or less. These headphones, also have a bigger price tag than even the new PS5 videogame console so we will have to wait and see if this is a successful product from Apple, I think they have gone a little overboard with the price, but rich people do tend to pay a premium for brand names. This can also be seen in the [latest](https://ibb.co/By3F6jS) analyst call from JPMorgan as customers appear to favor high end models as delivery times have been increasing for the 12 Pro and 12 PRO MAX.   On the better side of things for Apple, the [Fitness+](https://ibb.co/Kh3KnQg) service is expected to launch on the 14th of December and it will cost $9.99/month or $79.99$/year. I expect this to be a better success for the company and to drive an even more stable increase of revenues, as subscription-based revenues are better than one-time sales.   So, I still like this company the most in the long-term and it might see a spike in the near future, especially moving closer to Q4 results and earnings. Apple is still the biggest position in my portfolio and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.

This week has me shook and I can feel my hands turning to paper. Not only did one of the Collisions straight up deny the Stripe x PSTH rumors, but the GME Q3 earnings call had the opposite of what people expected (instead of executing the remaining allocated buyback, they filed for an option to issue new shares). Seems like the prevailing theories which led me to buy these stocks in the first place are dead in the water.  I still strongly believe in both companies and also believe that they’ll both fulfill their WSB DD prophecies eventually, but my 100% conviction has definitely wavered this week.  Luckily I just own an irresponsible amount of shares and very few options. I’m still up quite a bit on both positions even accounting for GME’s AH plummet.  Question is:  Do I hold all? Trim my positions? Cash out and move on?

Sell. Motherfucking. CC’s. How much are you down per share? $2? $3? More? Doesn’t matter. You have 100 shares, you have a fighting chance. Time to join theta gang. Sure, sometimes they give us shit, but their strategies work. So, Sell-To-Open a covered call for each 100 share bag you’re holding, find a strike price above or at your cost basis, chose and expiry and boom - some amount of dollars goes back into your account. Good, now your cost basis is $X minus the value of the call. If GME recovers and shoots past $X, your shares get called away, but you made profit. If it doesn’t, if it trades sideways or goes down, theta/delta drive the price of the call down, ao buy that shit back for a net profit and repeat. Remember, if you have a multiple of 100 shares, you can still fight. First rule - don’t lose money.   Now, #2. You fuckers make me sick. I mean, sure, we don’t feel sorry for you when you lose money, you dance with the market, you accepts the risks, but there’s literally no good reason to be happy about it, let alone ecstatic. Is your wife less ugly and your dick longer because some sad shmuck loses his rent money on GME? Is their misfortune somehow making your life less of a shithole? Are you no longer living in your parent’s basement because an autist bought GME calls when fucking everyone said “buy shares”? Be a decent fucking human being and don’t gloat. Oh, and another thing. That company still sold one billion motherfucking dollars of stuff in a quarter, despite the shithow we live in. What did you do this quarter? Some of you are gonna point me to your massive gains, but I say to fuck with that - you did it with massive help of lady luck, some other company’s hard work and your hand in your pants, GME made their $$ from hard work, that makes them respectable, and you a lucky speculator that’s gonna lose their shirt one day while GME still survives.  TL;DR; #1 - stop whining, put your big boy pants on and either DCA or sell CCs. #2 - eat a dick.  Downvote this to oblivion or upvote it to stratosphere, I don’t care.

So anyway after GME management has shown themselves to be as retarded as we are, I thought I'd share a few things for the newbies to help cope and recoup losses after today's shit show. if you read my previous post you would've expected a dump after Q3 earnings, although I have to admit I was expecting a 10% dump, not a 17% dump. That shelf offering was completely unexpected and the only valid reason for having it IMO would be for management to sell some shares during a squeeze to help raise funds. There are a few other reasons that people brought up that I thought made sense, no need for me to repeat it here.   Fundamentally the earnings were pretty much as expected, a better than expected loss was pretty much priced in and things look like they're on track for Q4. Management closed more unprofitable stores, reduced inventory, sold their private jet (lol), and e-commerce is up. Risks to that outlook would be a restart of lockdowns and stimulus not being passed on time. Remember that IWM and many other ETFs hold quite a lot of GME shares, so a dump in those means we dumping as well. Don't forget to think about the risk of an overall market dump, since we are getting close to dec OPEX with record low put/call ratios, this market is being driven up by call buying and MM hedging can dump just as hard as they pump. I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that'll take place between late dec- early Feb, watch for changes in option positioning and VIX term structure for clues.  Between now and Q4, the only catalyst for a durable pump would be the announcement of deals like the one with MSFT (there are rumors of a deal with SONY, not likely IMO), reports of VERY strong sales of consoles (good isn't good enough). We will likely start to have a slow ramp-up leading up to the earnings. These are your reasons to bag hold.   People keep on asking RC to start a takeover but I doubt that will happen, in fact, I think RC might just sell his stake, since it's already up like 300%. Don't make any significant moves based on speculations on what RC might do.  For the immediate near term, figure out how to sell covered calls if you haven't already, selling weeklies can help bring down your cost basis, especially while IV is high. iBorrow shows borrow costs at 50%, which is near ATH I think, we might get a small but significant short-covering rally, sell your calls into these rallies. On the other hand, WSB might FOMO into weekly puts, which will also inevitably backfire but drag prices down in the process, take advantage of this by finding put walls near support and selling puts at a price you're comfortable DCA-ing at.   Keep your eyes on the prize, which IMO really just come down to a new console cycle, the fact that there is a shortage of consoles right now just means people will be forced to shop at GME when other giants like AMZN or WMT runs out of stock. Keep an eye on any news about logistics and supply chain, if the giants get the upper hand in procuring new consoles, that will seriously damage the bull thesis  &amp;#x200B;  Good luck retards|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1677616|public|confidence|self|||[DD] GME shareholder DD and support thread|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9klph/dd_gme_shareholder_dd_and_support_thread/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Anyone that bought weekly FDs, I feel bad for you son.   Autists that bought calls when IV was at 200% and at the top, you knew what you were getting into; you knew earnings would suck a giant cockmeat sandwich, revenue would be the steaming shit sandwich on the the side.  We all knew this was going to dip after earnings. Your mom knew. Even my dog knew.   What might have avoided the IV crush was if GME management would have given better guidance, but what do these boomer fucks know except omnichannel and whatever bs corporate lingo for restructuring and cost cutting is.  We know there needs to be some sweeping changes in leadership that much is obvious.   The important thing is, short squeeze is still in play.   1. Nothing has changed after earnings.  Other than the alternative securities shelf.   2. People are making a big deal out of the alternative securities shelf, but it’s only $100M.  If GME gets to $20, that’s only 5M shares, even at $10 a share, it’s 10M.  That’s still not enough to cover all the shorts relative to the float.  The “dilution” is to prevent any Cohen takeover, and/or to get ready to release some shares to shorts that won’t be able to cover (kind of how VW released some shares during the squeeze).   3. Cost to borrow to short shares is going back up to 50%.  Shorts had their chance to cover during the low cost to borrow and when GME popped during run up to earnings, but they didn’t.  Higher cost to borrow sets the table for the squeeze.   4. They still can pull the trigger for the $100M buyback this fiscal year.  That could be the catalyst.   5. They’re going to close stores and pivot to e-commerce. Streamline/Omni, improve logistics and channels.    I have doubts about the next earnings when console cycle numbers coming up will trigger the squeeze. It will be news, or something else that will serve as a catalyst.    For those that are worried about GME drilling down to $10, I don’t think it drills down past $13.69.  But who cares, it wasn’t ever about earnings but the squeeze to fucking Valhalla.

When market opens it will sell at market price and it is way past my S/L of $14.

That said, I hope you autists were in fact in with shares, and not calls: otherwise, u r fuk.   But back to the point: there was one very interesting pair of questions posed during the call: the first related to why GME would be planning to sell more shares ($100million’s worth). The answer was given with remarkable force compared to most of the others, and was also quite clearer: it was emphasized that GME did NOT NEED THE MONEY: it was simply an option being considered for the sole possible purpose of “increasing liquidity.” The reason they gave was in case the beer flu hit them hard again. With the vaccine coming, this seems like horse shit. To translate their likely intention for gay bears: if in fact there is a short squeeze, they would be primed to capitalize off of it by selling off some shares at a crazy good price. In addition, when asked if they would be buying back more shares in general, they said “it would not be off the table”: and I’m pretty certain that other $100 million left for share buybacks by the end of this fiscal year hasn’t been used yet. I think they’ve definitely got their heads out of the sand, and I look forward to their continued success. Continued success, you ask? Yes. Their fourth quarter, if what they said is true, might be the first profitable quarter they’ve had in years. Good luck, everyone.   Disclaimer: Not financial advice for anyone except my parents, who are the only people in my family holding GME positions at the moment.

Currently I am trading/investing using a platform that is available to me in New Zealand.   I would love to get into trading options but have not found a platform to support this in my country,   If someone could refer me to a webpage or app that can facilitate options trading internationally I would highly appreciate it,     Now I would like to break down my experience with WSB over my 1st week.   Immediately when I entered this forum I was overwhelmed with GME/meme stock hype and sucumed to the excessive use of the 🚀 emoji.   Yes it was very enticing to hear all the speculation regarding a short-squeeze in response to short interest in GME and I ended up buying in @ 15.58 when the FOMO kicked in.     After a somewhat logical evaluation, It was clear that the underlying business model of GME largely capitalized on a rather traditional and dated sales strategy. Historical share price trends were driven by instore sales, console releases and of course secondhand trade-ins.    Though Covid-19 has been changing global dynamics and consumer spending since the end of Q1, It was evident that Gamestop failed to correctly adjust and deliver a revised  sales strategy to combat the rapid decline of interest in their 5,500 locations.     Now, lets go to the public letter presented by Ryan Cohen, pleading for strategic review.   This to me, was interpreted as a desperate cry for change to try deter a company from the looming path of bankruptcy.   Time was on GME's side for the best part of 2020, and I question why change was not brought into fruition earlier.   Were the directors of GME simply complacent to impact COVID would reap?   GME had full position to open a digital platform for second-hand gaming trade,    something resembling the marketplace STOCK-X would have kept their second-hand market strong throughout the restrictive times.   Is the hype generated by Cohen's letter and any change made from this afternoons announcements enough to revive the company?   It almost seems too little to late for GME to put its heavy footprint into E-commerce realm as competitors adjusted swiftly and dynamically to COVID, maximizing their position in the this consumer market.   Also I have acknowledged that PS5 delivery numbers have been limited, and disappointed our expectations.  This evaluation has supported my paper hands and I sold my stock @ 16.6 on Monday morning.     Below I have attached my current positions as of 8/12     https://preview.redd.it/bfszs7cbe1461.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb7737e04587bd7cbc7616c3314aa2fc940745b2|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1675982|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/j5oTp-n1jKePOg3Csh7swOVToo6pE_hGBs1KcqYlfLg.jpg|40.0|140.0|Evaluation of my first week trading, hype effect &amp; international options trading platform|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9eagv/evaluation_of_my_first_week_trading_hype_effect/|no_ads|0.0||dark||||||||||

I don't have a position yet, but I think even with this announcement I'll scale into a position regardless with some options. Even at $100m offering, that is a dilution of less than 10 million shares. I believe the numbers were something like 60+ million shares held short in the middle of November. I'm sure that the number has decreased but I doubt that the short float has dropped to below 10 million shares. I'm pretty sure shorts are looking for a way out of this squeeze, and maybe this is their saving grace, I'll start grabbing a position later this week with some long term options.

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.  And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen’s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that’s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you’re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the “Chewy-fication” of GameStop – efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.  And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn’t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn’t like Sherman’s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he’s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He’s saying: Don’t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.  And the “or else” is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the “or else” is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn’t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman’s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it’s done. He’s got the eye of the tiger, he’s still in that young and crushing it phase. He’s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he’s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He’s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.  Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company—the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he's going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.  And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It’s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call – one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it’s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you’re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?  Or do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don’t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It’s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I’m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman’s incentives – financial, ego – point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn’t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that’s coming to him. But even though I’d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I’m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren’t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.  This is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1674950|public|confidence|self|||GME Q3 Call Thoughts on the clash between Cohen and Sherman [Insert Rocket Emoji Here]|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9apx5/gme_q3_call_thoughts_on_the_clash_between_cohen/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

I think we should use this to our advantage as GME shareholders to walk the board through what should be done to come out on the other end of this by making a more detailed next steps letter than Cohen did.  I believe we all are uniquely positioned to give a fairly accurate VOC (ELI5: Voice of the customer, basically a company surveying customers to see what they want so that they can sell shit to them) since we are all playing video games on some device while our wife goes on dates with her boyfriend.  I wanted us to lay these ideas out that we believe will help the company and then we can get one of the less retarded of us to send the best ideas in a letter to the board.  To start off, one idea I have to leverage the current brick-and-mortar locations is to create a return partnership with these e-retailers like Amazon has with Kohl's but specifically for gaming returns. Kohl's uses it to increase foot traffic by giving the person returning something a receipt with a Kohl's coupon which greatly increases the likelihood of making a sale.

(or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)  3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.  4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.  5) A driver accepts  6) The restaurant hits a ""confirmed rdy"" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.  At EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the ""Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop"" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.  Customers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit ""Picked Up"", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.  What happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.  Uber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers ""boosts"" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a ""2$ boost"" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).  **2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**  Repeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.  Here's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.  The way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!  I get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.  I call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.  Here are the possible outcomes :  A) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.  B) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.  What do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an ""independent contractor"", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.  Let's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.  I've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.  Their support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.  I try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.  I leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.  I go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.  I go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support ""Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time"". Support says ""That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming"".  Next week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?  I could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.  My friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.  **Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide ""oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?""**  TL;DR SHORT DOORTRASH  Positions, all stock, will be shorting DD with my GME profits soon enough.

This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.     The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.     Call Data   * Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)    * 75.3% of the calls are out of the money  * The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money.   * The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money.    Put Data   * Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts  * 86.1% of the puts are out of the money  * The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money  * The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money    On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close.   The most popular calls that are in the money are the   * TSLA 570 – 590  * ACB 10.    The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.    The most popular calls that are out of the money are the   * TSLA 600 - 650,  * GME 20,  * PLTR 25 - 40,  * AMD 100,  * SPY 370 - 380, * APHA 9.    The most popular puts that are out of the money are   * NKLA 15,  * PLTR 15 – 21,  * NIO 40  * ACB 7.    As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting.   Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:  * SPY 370 Calls: $2.10 * TESLA 600 Calls: $2500|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1667414|public|confidence|self|||Do you want to bet against reddit?

LOOK at GME earnings call quarters this year and they have all reported negative earnings YET the stock goes up.   Q3 2020 for Dec 8th, the earnings are expected to be negative as well but the stock will go up. Last Friday was the best time to buy the stock before it goes up this earnings call.   For those asking about the short squeeze, NOW LOOK at the expected Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. They’re both expected to be positive earnings. So the stock is just going to keep going up and any news about the future and Cohen will keep driving it up. At some point, in theory,  the short squeeze will happen.    Below I make reference for all of the 4 earnings call for 2020  [GME earnings calls 2020](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/12/18675057/preview-gamestops-earnings)  Quarter	Q2 2020	Q1 2020	Q4 2020	Q3 2019 EPS Estimate	-1.13	-0.46	0.79	0.11 EPS Actual	-1.40	-1.61	1.27	-0.49 Revenue Estimate	1.02 B	1.09 B	2.24 B	1.62 B Revenue Actual	942.00 M	1.02 B	2.19 B	1.44 B   AND IF YOURE INTERESTED IN Q1 2021 you can see the expectation on the article below.

Net revenue for the third quarter increased to $280,000 from $92,000 in the prior quarter and from $56,000 in Q3 of last year. The sequential and year-over-year increase in net revenue was due to a significant amount of revenue generated from two customers in the quarter.  &gt; *Net revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020, increased to $1.8 million from $162,000 in the same period last year.*  &gt; *The increase was primarily due to revenue generated in connection with the beta testing of KAI as well as the significant amount of revenue generated from two customers.*   You read that right, they were making cash off of *the AI's beta test* - it is now in the wild and finding botnets.

UMC also reportedly plans to complete its 28nm at the Xiamen facility by the middle of next year.  &gt; Related: Last month, UMC reported Q3 revenue growth of 19% Y/Y.

This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.     The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.     Call Data   * Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)    * 75.3% of the calls are out of the money  * The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money.   * The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money.    Put Data   * Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts  * 86.1% of the puts are out of the money  * The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money  * The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money    On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close.   The most popular calls that are in the money are the   * TSLA 570 – 590  * ACB 10.    The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.    The most popular calls that are out of the money are the   * TSLA 600 - 650,  * GME 20,  * PLTR 25 - 40,  * AMD 100,  * SPY 370 - 380, * APHA 9.    The most popular puts that are out of the money are   * NKLA 15,  * PLTR 15 – 21,  * NIO 40  * ACB 7.    As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting.   If you are interested in the full dataset I could potentially post it somewhere.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1665115|public|confidence|self|||If you want to sell options, these are what you should be selling...|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k87h0v/if_you_want_to_sell_options_these_are_what_you/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

I will single handily create the short squeeze when they announce they are out of stock on everything at earnings. The sudden influx of cash will let them buy back every share on the market and soon the shorts will cry for mercy.   Then, 15 days later, after the short squeeze has happened, I will simply return it all to my local GameStop, abusing their 30 day return policy.

Like the tens of thousands former $DIS corporation cast members, you’ve been laid off for months and are bored out of your fucking mind. Who knows how you’ll pay for rent next week? Having stretched your $1,200 Trump bucks as far as possible, you’ve begun considering cashing in and seeing if there’s a market for Sheriff Woody on OnlyFans. You always knew it would come to this; you think to yourself as you gaze upon your old $DIS corporation costume.   Fortunately, before you can hit submit, an old buddy, Tom Nook, calls you up to drop a fat tip. That’s right, good old Tom got a job working for $GME Stop, and they’re hiring people just like you. After a quick 5 minute conversation, you’ve got a new job. Even better, the company respects your rights, given by God, and doesn’t require you wear a mask or submit to humiliating “health and wellness” checks every morning like Biden supporters and the Fake News love to do.   Much like investors in $GME Stop’s stock, you’ve hit the jackpot. Everything’s going to be OK; the only Woody you’ll be sharing this Christmas is with your store manager in the stock room. The COVID-flu hit traditional brick and mortar retail stores like a songbird flying 28 mph into a lit window at night. While most retailers were grossly unprepared to handle the drop in sales and health risks associated with this event, $GME Stop had nothing to lose. In a world where swans are black and coronavirus is fake, $GME Stop has ignored health and safety recommendations, putting shareholder value first while competitors have been duped and distracted by fads such as face masks and toilet paper. Furthermore, $GME Stop has been a bastion of hope for other brick and mortar retailers to aspire to - with more than one PS5 in stock on Black Friday unlike the other stores near me like Best Buy ($BBY) or Target ($TGT) who “discouraged” us from camping out and “required” face coverings on threat of expulsion.  ** With new VR and 3D TV technologies on the horizon, and the rise of Mobile Gaming, institutions are sure to be clamoring for $GME Stop shares after earnings on Tuesday. It’s undeniable, millions of Americans are sitting at home and the demand for adult entertainment has only continued to grow during these difficult times. From the hottest consoles to the sexiest Switch games, $GME Stop is well positioned to pleasure and delight customers across the globe for many years to come.  **TLDR; $GME Stop may shock shorts and pop after inspiring investors to embrace their animal spirits following earnings on Tuesday.**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1663409|public|confidence|self|||$GME Earnings 12/8/20 – Will Gamestops’s Shops Shock the Stock?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7yq17/gme_earnings_12820_will_gamestopss_shops_shock/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

In fact, we are a minority owner group of fucking GameStop. So, as a minority owner, I thought about what I’d want GME to do, as their business model right now, is for lack of a better word, ass.  TGT and ULTA have paired up for ULTA to use space in Target locations to sell their products. Being overly reductive- TGT takes the revenue, leases the space to ULTA, and ULTA supplies the product and keeps the profits. Sephora and Kohl’s have announced a similar deal.  Could GameStop replicate that model? If you look at anyone who they would naturally pair with: BestBuy, WalMart, Frys, etc. There’s nothing that either entity could bring to help improve the business of the other.  Second, let’s look at what RC has said he wants for the company. He wants them to become the “Amazon” of gaming. A lot of that, to me, means order fulfillment. This is hampered in the times of COVID by two things, real estate prices, and the very, very, limited square footage of GameStop retail spaces.  I think that a partnership with Costco could alleviate those concerns. First, Costco is a warehouse that makes pretend it is a retail space. They have room in their locations. Lots of it. This could allow CostCo to act as distribution and BOPIS fulfillment for GME. Additionally, right when you walk in they have that electronics area that has some decent stuff, but fucking barely any gaming and generally terrible advice and service for people looking into that stuff. Enter GameStop. They could lease that space, do the training for the electronics staff and provide a better variety of products for the electronics area. Like TGT/ULTA, GME leases some of the space, provides the product, service. COST gets to report the revenue. GME gets a ton of space to store product, so that they’re not pathetically short-stocked on launch days. Also, since COST would allow GME to make much larger product orders, COST could possibly offer games or accessories at “Costco prices”. Gamer Chairs, gamer desks, headsets, shit like that comes to mind as something Costco could sling effectively. It would also likely cut out even more overhead in larger metros where one costco could distribute for 5+ retail locations.  Costco still closes shitty locations, further cutting overhead, but this streamlined process could save them a decent amount of $ on shipping costs.  I don’t know shit about customer data or customer acquisition costs. But they both have a large amount of customer data, that when merged, could possibly help both parties?   TL;DR - COST acts as a warehouse for GME online orders and for distribution. Both profit.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.  # **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)** ***** &gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead. ***** &gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal. ***** &gt; “It probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don’t know what the answer is to that,” said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “If it’s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.” ***** &gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans. ***** &gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. “I wouldn’t think it’s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it’s less than $900 billion,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ***** &gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher. ***** &gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March. ***** &gt; “Is it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?” said Schumacher. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464. ***** &gt; # Getting jabbed &gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market’s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines. ***** &gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. ***** &gt; “They’re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that’s something that’s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. “That’s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they’re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.” ***** &gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna’s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S. ***** &gt; “The vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,” said Hogan. “There’s going to be some volatility around the logistics.” ***** &gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions. ***** &gt; “The big question is how long does the Covid surge last?” Krosby said. ***** &gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday’s weekly jobless claims more important for markets. ***** &gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday. ***** &gt; “There is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,” said Krosby. “It’s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.” *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**  *****  &gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode  &gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.  &gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**  &gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**  &gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**  *****  &gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues  &gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**  &gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices—Customer Inventories and Employment—showed contractionary readings.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**  &gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**  &gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**  &gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**  *****  &gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa  &gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:  &gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928 &gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%) &gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%) &gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020 &gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%) &gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%) &gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009 &gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)  &gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Add ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.”  &gt; Here’s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. “The bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,” according to Ryan Detrick. “Also, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.”  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn’t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December’s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn’t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

Not calls. WSB needs to reduce the available float.   I'm seeing too many retards going all in on calls. Have y'all seen the IV on this? Your calls are getting IV fucked post ER.   So if you're playing this, buy shares and hold. Atleast until the squeeze starts and you see insane returns. You'll know when that happens. But even if the squeeze doesnt materialize, hold this until next ER in Q1 2020. Console numbers will come out in next ER. Consoles are sold out literally everywhere. This is a cyclical stock. Look at what happened to GME when PS3 and PS4 came out.   Short percentage of float is 292% lol thats an insane number. This rocket is literally filled to the brim, ready to take off at any positive catalyst. For GME, the worst has passed. It's only one way from here on. At least in the short term.

Others are less obvious, with random numbers spread out over a wider period of time. But it's not easy to create legit-looking entries and have an impact since they can't see the whole data set.  There were so many that I couldn't go through all the responses in a detailed way, and was more conservative to exclude more responses than necessary. Unfortunately, I'm also hiding the category column and grouped duplicates, outliers, fake entries into the Excluded category so that I don't provide any helpful feedback to fakers. Apologies for removing transparency for the sake of countering spoilers.  If we really wanted to stop the fakers, we would ask for email addresses, but then no one would fill out the form. But it doesn't matter anyways, because...  **2) Fake entries don't even matter much, since it just has to be in the ballpark**  Surveys have a huge margin of error and only have to be directionally correct (see recent political polls). The fakers think they're playing 4D chess but are actually playing Candyland... and losing to 4 year-olds. They have the logical skills of GME shorts (which they probably are).   **3) The main benefit of the survey is social proof**  From all the responses and all the shares, it's obvious we are a force to be reckoned with. We hold great power, and with great power come great tendies. The next time you get weak hands (next Wed), remember everyone else holding until a squeeze.

I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure – I own \~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.  First off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.  Now, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:  *Same-Store Sales*  * Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20) * Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)  **If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 – 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**  **Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I’m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**  &amp;#x200B;  Happy to answer any questions :)|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1655811|public|confidence|self|||$GME is a SCREAMING buy.

I want to start losing everything on Options, but have some questions to make sure I do it as efficiently as possible:  How liquid are ITM options?  If I pick up some TSLA 12/31 $600c, and the stock touches $625, how quickly would I be able to dump the contracts? is it as quick as with shares?  If I buy $600c contracts, but the price goes down, I’m out only the premium I paid right? Conversely, if I buy $600p and the price goes up, I’m only out the premium?  It’s only if I “write” contracts that I’m obligated to buy or sell those shares.  Also, I seem to catch on to what you guys are suggesting a little late. I am usually looking at buying into whatever your talking about while it’s near the top (PLTR @ $27.60) What keywords should I be looking for in your retarded posts that will clue me in to what is going to happen before it starts moving?

Boomer stocks; especially AT&amp;t and GE, are generally looked down on by this forum and for good reason. I took a look at Stocktwits and when AT&amp;T moved up 1 FUCKING percent, people were freaking out, acting as if the messiah had returned or some bullshit. Well, I have reason to believe it's going to move a lot more than just 1 percent over the next month.  First: Potential Price Upgrade?  Currently, Morningstar has a price target of $37 per share, a very nice increase from the current stock price. This is primarily because of Time Warner's willingness to move forwards and keep releasing movies (Some pretty big names such as Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and the Conjuring), even with the Vurus shutting down theaters across the country. Also, AT&amp;T is bidding out DirectTV (even at a potential loss), freeing up its assets for better opportunities.  Second: Technicals:  I will link another post with some technical voodoo in it, but they look good according to my crayon vision. Again, within the next year this could easily hit $37 per share, considering this still has not fully recovered from the crash of March.  This is the major reason as to why I am very interested in this stock. Also, because of the incredibly low IV, options are cheap as hell currently, even ITM monthlys.  Finally, if you want to look at my track record, my two major plays this year was a certain vaccine company (Ticker is banned) back in March, managed to make quite a nice amount off of them when the stock went from my buy in at a little over a dollar to my sale of $6 per share, and my latest play was 369 APHA $17.5 Jan 15 calls which printed like mofos. (You can see my shitty dd on these in past posts).  Anyways, I am not a financial consultant and if you buy anything, do it on your own accord please!

I started trading 6 weeks ago, I’m up 120% yoloing my life savings on meme stocks, and I’m feeling absolutely fucking bulletproof.   Two things are known:  1) GME is absolutely going to squeeze harder than my dick was last night watching my wife’s bf ram her from behind.  2) It’s going to take some catalyst to get that shit moving.   There’s some hope that earnings next week will be that catalyst. In the meantime, all you degenerates are yoloing calls like there’s no tomorrow. Some of you boomer cucks are using your noggins and buying shares, and actually contributing to The Big Squeeze premise.   See, the problem is that you Chads are buying shares in dribs and drabs - your student loan cheque comes in and its $100 here, $300 there, spread out of a long period of time. Like the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs jizzing into the Nile one at a time, the impact is not felt. Only when every man in Egypt rubs one out do we get a flowing cum river. Multiplication of energies or some shit.   But think about it. If we could band together and collectively and instantaneously buy a metric fuckton of boomer shares, instead of parcelling our purchases out over weeks or months like we have been, we might just stand a chance of moving the needle on this bitch. We could be the catalyst. We could be the MMs. We could fucking Moby Dick this bitch.   So what’s the plan?   There are 1.7 million subscribers to this sub. If each one of you shitbricks PayPals me just $7.06, we would collectively have $12 million to play with.   You think you see where this is going, but you don’t. This shit right here is why they are going to name a school after me.   In the run up to earnings (let’s say on Monday 07th or Tuesday 08th), I take $8 million, and drop that shit on GME shares. A big whale moving in that close to earnings has got to be noticed, and my bet is that those short shits sit up and take notice. Boom, short squeeze triggered.   Now here’s where it gets interesting. I take the remaining $4 bar, and continually place buy orders 5% below the current share price as it moves up. If that little shit even thinks about correcting, there will be so much resistance 5% below that it will have no choice but keep on mooning. Literal. Infinite. Gains.   Earnings won’t even matter. That shit will moon so hard it will Uranus. And the best part is, it won’t be able to stop. This quite literally cannot go tits up.   I cannot see the downside to this. Infinite gains, and all it will cost each of you is less than the price of your morning blowjob.   Be the change.

I dont know when but If it squeezes in time the profit can have a bigger impact than we could have made before.

Since **mid-November**—and right after RC sent his soon to be legendary letter to the Board—GameStop posted some mighty interesting job announcements for its Grapevine HQs. Especially for a Dying-Brick-and-Mortar-90s-Mall-Bro-Boomer company.   It definitely seems like this Blockbuster redux is TOTALLY uninterested in pivoting to e-commerce, digital monetization, and a technologically-driven marketing infrastructure and product distribution landscape.   Just find ‘em in the mall.  Or else you bears are just fucking stupid and cant read or understand words good.  But you don’t have to take my word for it. Do the clickity clickity and the read-y read-y.   I think you’ll find it just as odd as I do that a soon-to-be-bankrupt boomer company just published a bunch of silicon-valley-jargon-filled-digital-monetization-bla bla jobs right before everyone is wondering if they’re going to pivot away from being Another Cautionary Tale and toward a Fuck Yeah E-commerce-centric Money Minting Technology-driven Gaming Company You’re Gonna Tell Your Goddamn Grandkids About When You’re Old and Rich (and hopefully fulfilled spiritually and emotionally after many kind and generous years of philanthropy and a lot of self-care and reflection)  Check out some of the highlights below. Or don’t. I don’t give a shit. But GTFO of here with any kind of tHis StOcK iS BlOckBusTeR comparisons any more you simps.

Your Google Alert for Gamestop tells you that trading is halted on the announcement that Cohen is taking over the company. This is the moment you've been waiting for. You open Robinhood and check your sell orders. You're smart.    Yep, they're set right. 100 shares at $25 and 100 more at $10 increments all the way to $105. You're going to make $70,000. That money will change your life. You can finally go back to school and move out of your mom's basement. You can dump Becky and finally tell her that you don't actually like sitting in the closet and watching her fuck Chad, even if it is the only way she can get off.   Trading resumes. You watch the price rise. $30. $48. $70. Your mind and your heart race as you mentally calculate how much money you've made. $115. $130. The squeeze has squoze. You watch the share price trend back down, settling at a respectable $17.04, but that no longer matters to you. You're RICH!     You open Robinhood to see what it feels like to have a five figure account balance. Buying Power: $3.50. There's a message.     ""Due to high traffic, some functionality may be impacted and trades may be delayed."""|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1650581|public|confidence|self|||Exactly how the GME squeeze will go for you.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5zmcd/exactly_how_the_gme_squeeze_will_go_for_you/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

(Also not well-versed in the gay talk yet so please be gentle.. though I'm not counting on it.)  Anyway, most of you are familiar with the WSB team effort GME short squeeze play suggested and that there has been a survey of shares owned by users in this sub as well. Now obviously that survey can't be super accurate, but it certainly does provide meaningful information on WSB participation and sentiment. I'm not smart or retarded enough to figure out if and how our very public discussion of this play can affect the success of it, and whether there could be an inverse relationship between public talk and a successful short squeeze. Institutional money and whales who are shorting are surely aware of us. Can they take countermeasures, and if so, what kinds?   It's that my gut says more of anything (interest, comments, analyses(gay), # of shares owned etc etc) just gives more info for the enemy to on. Can someone smart teach me a lesson or two in regular-person talk?

This worked out pretty good so when it spiked back up a little Tuesday I added closer to the money puts to my position. Which has paid off since they are down about 20% in the past 2 days.  That means people are starting to sell off their profits in anticipation of the lockup ending on the 8th. That is a great signal that he was correct and indicates the market is expecting heavy selling after the lockup so those investors (who bought in at $21) can collect some profits.   I'm not sure if it's already to late to get in now if you missed the boat but I just wanted to take a minute and thanks u/maxprtr for his DD that was un related to the memes and look forward to seeing any of your future plays.

My hands are sore from jerking off your dad so I’ll make this brief.   A cup and handle pattern is formed [during an existing uptrend ](https://imgur.com/a/W7YOBWS) which GME was certainly not in during 2019. A quick zoom out to the weekly chart [makes this pretty obvious.](https://imgur.com/a/H0kWHLI)  What you’re [seeing](https://imgur.com/a/XU9Hl08) is [basing](https://imgur.com/a/dsi8C5M), a period of consolidation where a downtrend stops but before the next uptrend begins. Very bullish if you catch the breakout, which was around $5.  The cup and handle pattern [has formed over the last 6 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/vHAWzv4) and is quite beautiful. However, if you’re playing this pattern you aren’t supposed to buy until it bounces back up and breaks the top of the cup. A lot of you have this cost base at $18-19 but got in too early and before the pattern is completed. If it completes the target is [around $26](https://imgur.com/a/WyKZZjI), though with other factors could be higher.

I've known her for about 5 years; probably one of the smartest and kindest people I know. Our friendship has dwindled over the past year because of an abusive relationship I got into, which I recently left because *that other girl* cheated on me. Prior to that, though, we used to hang out 24/7. I'm sitting here scratching my head as to why I chose someone else instead of her.   However, after the pandemic began, and right when I started investing into PLTR (my very first WSB advice taken), my friend and I have been hanging out more. I have to admit, before I fell out of my recent relationship; I had already been hanging out with her. We went from playing Among Us together and League of Legends while calling to going on walks together and hanging out at the park. Albeit, with some restraint due to the COVID restrictions.  Recently, I got this friend into ""investing**"".** And I gave her some ""advice"" based on strict ""fundamental and technical analysis"" of sound stocks. **She all ins GME** ***stocks*** **on November 23 and gets out on November 27 (amounts to about 20K CAD -- 1000+ shares, around there).**  I was shocked.   This was very out of character, even for her. Normally, you would imagine this girl as the cool-headed, neutral sweet heart who would make your breakfast while the light of the dawning sun beams through the window onto her porcelain skin. She had an ROI of 21.44% (Return on investment). Now imagine if she bought calls instead. Then it dawned on me. What if she is not as level-headed as I think she is? What if she's actually **wild**, and **impulsive?** Until now, I have no answer to that question.  I want to know one thing, though. Something all guys are curious about when they have a cute and cunning friend that is a female. **What does she look like in ""bed?""** I began to ponder it over and over again. I've already fantasized multiple times. Images such as my hand gripping her sweet, porcelain neck softly as I cause her body to twitch erratically from pure pleasure as beads of sweat flies off of her petite, but perfectly shaped breasts. I want her to call me lewd and vulgar names as I softly bite the tip of her ear, while amassing a large penetrating force from behind her. And I want to enter a moment where my breaths barely synchronize with hers as we are lost in each other's eyes.    And some of you may doubt me, but trust me. I've had more experience with my right hand than most of you have in your whole life.   *And I know. It's indecent*.   It's just something I can't help thinking about and projecting to you all. You people who have made my life a success. At this point, I'm leaving all of my major life decisions to you. The story is not over and I want to begin a new chapter with this chick.   **If you know a babe as level-headed but then she all ins her investment, wouldn't she be wild in bed too?** Let me know what you think."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1646205|public|confidence|self|||If NIO hits $60 within the next 2 weeks and XPEV hits $80, I'm going to bed my hot friend|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5f242/if_nio_hits_60_within_the_next_2_weeks_and_xpev/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

It currently offers a few major pharma drugs including Chantix, viagra, and EpiPen. Out of the Top 10 causes of death according to the WHO, VTRS offers therapeutics to 9 of them. VTRS is a new kind of healthcare company with a 1400 product portfolio and is extremely well positioned in the future of global healthcare.

Anyway why not start a campaign to write the SEC to look into the over shorting of GME. I have been trading since 89 and I have never seen a stock with more shares short than the float. there is 25.91 million shares short more than the float of the stock. I have witnessed EXPE, ROOM, HLF and Volkswagen shorts, but never seen anything like this. How do you even short anymore than the float ? do you just make up shares which is illegal under the guidelines and trading rules.    Then how do you get 65.16 million shares outstanding and 67.45 million shares short. Even if the float wasn't enough they shorted 2.29 million shares over every share ever issued in this company. How is it even possible? The answer is it isn't and it's illegal    tradingandmarkets@sec.gov  is the e-mail address   [https://www.investor.gov/](https://www.investor.gov/) is the website where below you can send tweets and other shit   If someone want to come up with a generic e-mail I will send it.

Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**  &gt;Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.   While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).   The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \[redacted\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \[redacted\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\~$15.80). The difference between \[redacted\] and $GME is that \[redacted\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.   This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.  Extreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.  And lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).  What will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  Also, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!  Lastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT. This is the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime, and you get to be part of history, and one day you'll be able to tell your grandkids how you fucked up, missed the $500 peak cuz you got too greedy, and sold it at $60 instead.

One thing I have been wondering is this, if we do get the huge short squeeze and hypothetically let's say it hits $50. Who is going to buy all our shares when we want to exit. Are the shorts going to be the ones paying $50 a share to exit their positions? Wouldn't they realize this is exactly what we are hoping for and just hold their positions until it drops again? Retail definitely isn't going to buy our shares at that price. Who exactly will be paying us our profits?

If you didn’t notice in the past couple of weeks prior to this slow “sell off” of GME, PLTR, and a handful of others these last few days, there was a large amount of bullish sentiment surrounding these stonks and you more than likely got AT LEAST 1-2 nice trades off before this ball draining decline (if you didn’t FOMO entirely too late). A large number of the bearish posts were being downvoted to oblivion or deleted by shit mods. Weird right. (Insert bull trap)   Now, if you look at the recent posts regarding these same stonk handles, there’s a growing number of bearish fucktards saying things like “PLTR $10 EOY” &amp; “GME going back to $5”. 🤡 The shorts are getting theirs during this time and are taking what they came for before the inevitable occurs with all of these (our testicles dragging across the moon, Mars, your mom’s chin, what have you 🚀🚀🚀). This is our time to shine. You heard it hear first. (Insert bear trap)  TL;DR - Don’t go against your senses and go all gay bear on us ... we’re holding strong and retail is about to overtake institutional. Don’t go too short on your calls but be sure to lock in these free tendies. 📈  GME $25+ EOY.  PLTR $35+ EOY.

The Bears in shambles, scrambled to cover, the shorts were overbought. Among his ranks a cry went up, the Bears were in retreat. So into the gap the Bull horde rushed, to clinch the Bear defeat. And as the Bulls pursued the Bears, a grim truth became clear: The Bears were not retreating, they were not fleeing in fear. The trap was sprung, the Bulls exposed, the Bears did circle in. The paper-handed fell in droves, their will was much too thin. Then in the distance, a clarion call, a bugle sounded out. A cry was heard, “RALLY TO ME, WE CAN REVERSE THIS ROUTE!” Upon a white horse, sitting tall, a figure could be seen. Ryan Cohen rides into the fray, swinging his mighty Peen. “A TENDER OFFER! A PARTNERSHIP! E-COMMERCE OF GREAT RENOWN!” And as he bellows his battle cry, the Bears are stricken down. Bruised and bloodied, the Bulls regroup around their mighty king. A knot of Bulls in a sea of Bears, the Bears begin to sing: “GME IS OVERBOUGHT, B&amp;M IS DEAD” “JOIN US BULLS, SHOW PAPER HANDS,SAVE YOUR FOOLISH HEADS” And as the Bears advance in waves the stricken Bulls reply: “YOLO! SHORT SQUEEZE! DIAMOND HANDS, GME’s A BUY!” And as the Bears fall on the Bulls, the shield wall does hold. As waves upon the shore they break upon the Bulls most bold. Wave by wave the Bears attack and wave by wave they fall. With hands of diamond the Bulls push back, Bear corpses form a wall. The Bulls ascend onto the wall, it’s here they’ll make their stand. And as they gaze upon the field Bear corpses for the land. And in the eyes of the Bears they see pride give way to dread. A moment of stillness, the Bears shy back, the Bulls then push ahead. With Ryan Cohen in the lead the mighty Bulls March on. “YOLO! SHORT SQUEEZE! DIAMOND HANDS!” the field rings with their song. Now tasting fear, the Bears lose heart and start to melt away. The Bulls push forward, the battle won, they’ll dine on tendies this day. The Bulls still standing, with hollow eyes, watch their foe retreat. They weigh the cost of their victory; the tendies oh-so sweet. Their paper-handed brethren laid into an early grave. “THEY SOLD TOO EARLY”, King Cohen states “TENDIES ARE FOR THE BOLD” “NOW WITH THE GAY BEARS OVERRUN, OUR DAY IS NEAR AT HAND.” “LET THE SHOET SQUEEZE BEGIN NOW, THIS IS MY COMMAND” “FOR ALL YOU BULLS WHO HELD THE FAITH”, King Cohen decried, “TENDIES FOR ALL, WE’LL SOON BE RICH, RO VALHALLA WE DO RIDE!”|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1641814|public|confidence|self|||Charge of the Bill Brigade; GME to infinity and beyond|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ryh9/charge_of_the_bill_brigade_gme_to_infinity_and/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

If people actually appreciate this stuff, I'll be happy to take the time to write up more of these.     Who am I/What do I do? I'm a fellow autist, but I'm also a licensed portfolio manager and I work for an investment firm that shall remain nameless. I don't trade on their behalf, so I'm free to do whatever I want on my own portfolio.   &amp;#x200B;  When buying a call (or a put), you're effectively buying the right to purchase a stock at a set price.   With a call, you are paying someone for the right to buy their shares at a specific price. This is called the **Strike price**. Your contract also has an expiry date. If the stock is below the strike price on/before the expiry, your option expires worthless, and your maximum loss is the amount of money you paid for the contract.   If the stock is above the strike price on/before the expiry, you can either sell the contract, or hold onto it with the hope of it continueing to go up. At expiry, if the contract is ""in the money"" (profitable), then you have the right to exercise this contract and buy the shares for the strike price.     Your call option has several things incorporated in it for the price you pay.  1) you have the time value. How long is left between the day you buy vs the day it expires.  2) Implied volatility of the stock between the day you buy and the day it expires (how much the expected move in the stock is between now and the expiry date)  3) the difference in price between the option's strike and the stock's price  4) The supply/demand factor.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's use real-life examples:   You buy 100 shares of GME. You're paying  **16.19** per share as of right now. That means you need to invest 1619$ today to have ownership of these shares.  Your maximum downside is 1619$, your upside is unlimited.  If shares drop back down to 5$, you lose 1,119$ \[ (16.19 - 5) x 100 \]   If shares run to 30$, you make 1,381$ \[ (30 - 16.19) x 100 \]  December 31 2020 16$ call options currently have a bid of 3.15$ and an ask of 3.40$.   Which means, if you buy at market price, you're paying 3.40$ per share for the right to buy shares between now and december 31st at 16$.   Assuming you hold until that day, your break-even price is 19.40$.   However, you only pay 3.40\*100 = 340$ for this right.  If the stock drops back to 5$, your maximum loss is 340$ in this scenario.   Your upside however, is unlimited.   If shares run up to 30$ on december 10th, you still have some time value to the options, plus you have some implied volatility, plus you have the movement.   So, your 16$ calls will probably sell for slightly more than 14$ (30-16).   At expiry, you'll have the option to either a) sell those options or b) have them exercise, allowing you to buy the shares for 16$.     The leverage effect comes in the fact that you only paid 340$ for this contract and in the fact that you get the upside of those 100 shares without as large of a cash outlay.     If you're right on the direction and the timing of your bet, you can make a lot of money.  If you're wrong, this acts as a way to minimize your losses.

This is a good thing, it is an opportunity to buy in more and serves to get rid of all the weaklings.  If you are one of those paper hands that panics and sells, CONGRATS you can now go pick up your boomer license and get a gratis invite to subs r/investing and r/stocks where you will feel right at home  This will be a lifeline for hedgeholes that cannot, must not allow GME to go over 18$ at any cost. If you do not understand this or ignore it then you need to read more (if that is a skill you possess) of the amazing DD that has been posted here before.  This is a war and yes apes, together, strong but do not forget the other side has manipulation weapons that are very precise and can keep pounding the price any sec of any day.  Expect a lot more hit pieces here and in traditional media that are designed to invoke fear in your ability to stay the course.  Luckily if you do stay retard-ant an autistical like myself and other beautiful peeps you will already know this and have more cash lined up for adding more shares to your sherwood forrest.

Bullish  🚀 It's safer to buy in the second half of the trading day; personally, I usually buy in the last 3 hours and again in the last 5 minutes before market close   If today's red, the closest trendline support + fib extension is at $15.92. Keeping pocket money in the unlikely case it drops that low wouldn't hurt  Weekly highs resistance since the last cycle is at $20.67, after that the sky is the limit.  ▶ Q3 earnings expectations?  🚀 If their guidance shows a stronger focus on e-commerce rather than brick-and-mortar stores, we'll surely see a pump, as that would kill every GME = Blockbuster shorter's theory. Bullish.  🚀 If they don't mention that and the price dumps, Cohen might step in and increase his stake, finally guiding GME into the 21st century. That would be a major squeeze catalyst. Bullish.  The earnings that matter the most though, are in Q4 (March 2021). They will show what a e-commerce powerhouse GME has become.  That said, I'm personally holding through earnings, hoping for a dump and a takeover by Cohen.  ""Worst"" case scenario the price pumps and I can't load up at cheaper prices.  That's why I'd rather have an amount of shares I'm happy with before earnings.  ▶ When do I cash out?  Realistically, whenever you're happy with the profits you've made.  🚀 The price peaked around $60s and the mid $50s in the last two console cycles, respectively. Now that GME has a modern business model it can be safely guessed that it can reach at least previous highs  🚀 No one can tell how high the price will be with the squeeze. I can tell you it's gonna be $200 if that makes you wet your pants, but that'd be wishful thinking cause, again, I can't guess how high it will be. $50 is already a good enough PT for me  That said, I'm happy I feel safe holding shares through ER, for once.

We want to pump $GME and force the short-sellers into a squeeze so we can pump this shit to the moon and get our tendies, no?   Well I think there is a better (or at least less financially painful way) for us all to do our part.   *What do we know?*   * We know that there are more short positions than shares outstanding. * We know GME has 100 million in cash for stock buybacks but will most likely not exercise to avoid giving Ryan Cohen (founder of [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) that bought 9.98% of all $GME shares &amp; doesn't like the way the board is running shit) control over the company/board.  * We know Michael Burry (Big Short legend) has a massive position (his second largest) and also seems to be invested in the short squeeze theory.    *Our Current Strategy:*   As of now, the hive mind has decided that we collectively yolo our life savings randomly (at random times) in random ways, leaving some of our comrades alone on the field, wounded with loss porn.   &amp;#x200B;  *My Suggested Strategy:*   We could force the short sellers to buy exponentially more shares to cover their shorts by increasing the risk/probability by buying DEEP OTM weekly call options.   STORYTIME:   Remember the $AAPL / $TSLA rally that dominated July and August? Well, there is consensus that there was a reason the squeezes were so aggressive and constant was the insane buying of these short expiry DEEP OTM call options by a few autists (myself included) and SOFTBANK.   Since institutions/market makers have to follow risk practices, most have to buy stocks to protect their positions - the higher the implied volatility, the more stock they have to buy... aka 100shares X \~imagine\~. As the demand rises for short-dated DEEP OTM call options so does the ""likelihood"" due to the increase in implied vol, forcing them to buy not in the 100s but 100,000s due to the increase in risk. Basically, you are forcing their hand far more aggressively than you ever could by just buying the stock itself.  &amp;#x200B;  So (theoretically), if we want to win the war, we need to be fighting with bombs not swords.

Ultimate tendies. But we’re all aware of this. Get your ass in Tesla now or risk becoming a full retard.  What isn’t talked about is how the money will be transferred into Tesla. The index is passive (not active like you dipshits following tickers all day). This means that shares that follow the S&amp;P now will be forced to sell in order to make room for Tesla.  Almost every stock within the S&amp;P will have shares sold off, driving the price down. With the S&amp;P tanking this will trigger the already unstable economy we’re in.

Equivalently, the shorter has borrowed N\*P\_0 dollars.  The person/institution can cover the share (buy back the share and return it to the broker)  after T periods at the price of P\_T, and make a gross profit (not considering the costs of borrowing) of N(P\_0 -  P\_T)  The costs to the shorter: interest paid + opportunity cost of what could have been done with the money (let's say buying an index ETF with an R% annual return is a relatively safe alternative).  So in the end, the shorter makes a loss if:  gains &lt; costs  N \* (P\_0 - P\_T) &lt; N \* P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]  Cancel out N from both sides:  (P\_0 - P\_T) &lt; P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]  Let's give our parameters numbers. If the shorter started their position in Nov 2015 (5 years ago, so T=5) when the price of GME was $40 per share, with an interest rate of r = 5% per year and the opportunity cost (the return on an index fund) being R = 4%, solve for P\_T  40 - P\_T &lt; 40 \* \[(1 + 0.05 + 0.04)\^5 - 1\]  40 - P\_T &lt; 40 \* 0.54  40 - P\_T &lt; 21.5  P\_T &gt; 18.5  So for this shorter who started its position at such a high price ($40) 5 years ago, the price should go above $18.5 to get them in the red.  This could explain why they fought so hard to keep the price below $18 today.

I've had an incredible revelation and I must tell all you mother fuckers!  This is just like WestWorld that TV show where the rich tourists go and they think the game is being in a Western Animatronics World and they can do sick stuff like kill people and rape and gamble and drink and ride horses. That's the game but the real, deeper, hidden game is the circle puzzle William is trying to solve. Williams done all the face value stuff over and over and then he realized that there's something more there. The puzzle maze under the scalp of the Indian.  That's the same idea with what's going on with GameStop!  The game isn't the next, new game you're going to buy from GameStop like CyberPunk 2077 or the next game console like the XBox Series X or PS5, No! the game is embedded in the GameStop Stock. The real, hidden game with GameStop is played with the GameStop Stock. The Game is to buy the stock and hold and wait for the squeeze. That's the game. In order to win, we need to wait for the squeeze. And put all our faith and money in GME and wait for this squeeze event to happen and have it happen. That's the Game. That's the entire purpose for all of GameStop's 5,000 stores! That's why GameStop was founded when video games became popular in North America in the 1990s! That's why all of this happened. It sounds absolutely crazy but it's true. It was all done by the makers and architects to bring us to this point. To this once in a 7 year console cycle that has begun a new again this November. It's also why Blockbuster, the rental company even existed and went bankrupt in the first place. It was all planned by our architects so that GameStop could be compared to BlockBuster so that certain people working at large financial companies would be compelled to short the stock to over 100% with their customer's money. This all sounds completely bananas and conspiratorial but it is all true. This squeeze event will be an event that will marry heaven and earth and reveal all secrets and lead to orgastic joy and pleasure and warm happiness for everyone in humanity. We will be rewarded 1000x over not just in monetary terms but also emotionally for brining about this once in the world / galaxy / time and space event!  &amp;#x200B;  Warning / Disambiguation: I'm not a financial specialist.

GME share price has been increasing steadily for the past few months. Every Release of a new console rapidly increases the price per share of GME such as in 2007 with the release of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and in 2013 with the release of the PS4 and Xbox 1, in both scenarios, the share price capped in the low 40's before falling back into the normal range. Before both of these ""console induced"" surges the price per share was $11 just check out this graph:   [GME the last 20 years showing a surge of both console releases.](https://preview.redd.it/zhna7ifxjh261.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f82684f1e1f3e94ac1bb9b36373755589ecfd90)  As seen in this stock price history graph price per share drops dramatically a couple of months after each console release. This is just beginning with GME today. THE SHORT TO FLOAT PERCENTAGE OF GME AS OF RIGHT NOW IS 292.53% this is very important. Starting very soon there could be a short squeeze. Since the number of people short selling this stock is insanely high in today's market, there is a very good possibility of a short squeeze. As I said at the start share prices have been rising making short-sellers nervous, as the price increases due to the ""console induced"" surge (and other factors ill link later), the more short sellers will buy back their losses since they are at an infinite risk for loss of money. Since this is likely to cause all of the short sellers to buy back their shorts the insane 292.53% short to float ratio will come into play, this is what will cause the short squeeze... AS THE SHORT SELLERS BUY BACK IT WILL DRAMATICALLY RAISE THE PRICE PER SHARE CAUSING A MASSIVE GAIN IN PROFIT. this is very likely to be way higher than the previous $40 per share cap as seen in the last console surges. This is why a short squeeze is likely and this is why there are millions of more shares owned than on Friday's market close. This is only the start gentlemen and watch as this phenomenon plays out.

First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings.   but we ain't here to ""invest"" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy.   IV for options around earnings are huge at \~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares)   What I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.  Do what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.

I would also like to say, PLTR has gone up so quickly and is so volatile right now. You can easily make %100 percent days or lose it all. So for that reason, I am stepping away from the stock just to let it cool off.   Before all you fucktards go check my post history and see that I didn't post anything about PLTR its cuz I didn't, I made a google slideshow for my school finance club, but it is timestamped so it's good enough. Link [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J5FeTZvrRgou_-HjvXiOAlRXCveea3CTcl7nXy25vZQ/edit#slide=id.g9f1af0b272_0_269). It was a rushed presentation and I didn't get to include all of the data I wanted to.   Ok, to get to the point, GME is the next big stock. The short squeeze is inevitable. Why? Because of retard power, it's literally WSB vs Hedge funds, and we all know who would win. Today was just a tease of the real squeeze. All of the hedge funds are gonna be fucking scared after today and are gonna sell their puts asap. GME to the fucking moon boys.

I don’t know whether this topic been discussed here but GME short squeeze will be one of the best trades ever. ( actually it’s been going for a month). Gamestop has around 41.54mln shares in float ( ignore shares outstanding ) and short interest is whopping 162%!!! ( btw, this is unprecedented event in capital markets , guaranteed ) it means, shorts have borrowed from other shorters to short. This is a nightmare for shorters because there is risk of being getting milked!!! How are they getting milked? Simple, stock goes up, they start accumulating losses ( in short you can have unlimited losses), they panic and start covering their shorts. Now this is interesting part! In GME, short interest is 162% meaning they have shorted more than what is out there trading. To cover , they have to buy in the open market from 41.54 mln shares available. Look at the second pic i uploaded which is simplistic version of what happens to GME. You have investor A say owns all 10 shares floating. Shorter B borrows from A and shortsi those 10 shares , you need investor C to purchase those who buys those shares and then lends again to investor D 6 of them to short ( here you go over 100-%. Short interest) and investor E buys those 6 shares. Now C and E thinks they “ own those shares” in fact they do, but when B and D is milked , they have to go out there to purchase from either A, C or E. someone has to sell 16 shares so shorters B and D can cover. When you have higher short interest it is hard without moving prices higher. Month ago shorted shares was 70 mln , in month 3 mln shares covered. But in the past 2 weeks prices have gone up by 50%. Expect more short covering which will push prices higher.

Callaway (Boomer golf company, who previously owned 14% of Top Golf, is now planning to buy the entire company through a stock issuance.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/news/callaway-topgolf-ceos-explain-merger/amp/  Why does this matter? Bc golf absolutely thrived during the pandemic, and Top Golf is the fastest growing golf niche in America right now. Let me pull out some stats: Golfers played 20% more rounds of golf August 2020 vs 2019.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/travel/golf-rounds-played-increase-2020-coronavirus/amp/  Additionally, Top Golf has experienced 30% yoy revenue growth each year since 2017. Top Golf is operating at similar capacity to pre-Covid thanks to the open bay environment, thus making it a reopening play that was never really punished.  This merger will weigh the company almost 50/50 between Callaway and Top Golf, with revenue streams projected to be around 50/50 too. However, this is a 1+1 = 3 scenario to me.

I have been lurking for a while and generally make stock plays here and there. Just starting doing options but, due to loss porn possibilities, I don't yolo it or make bets that seem crazy. Missed opportunity but I only have like 1 or 2 calls on PLTR.  Basically I am probably the biggest idiot here and am looking for advice and/or resources you guys use. I would like to pay attention to stocks on the side to supplement my income hopefully. At worst I will just lose money I am okay with losing. At best I will use the gains as fire wood in the winter.  If you guys are feeling generous please help a retard out.   Something I have noticed is there seem to be a lot of people in my shoes as well so maybe it will help someone else out as well.  Thanks in advance and you all are fantastic. Let me know if I need to brown nose anymore. Preferably the people that YOLO'd on PLTR and GME.

For all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon🚀  **So what is Alteryx?**  glad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.  **Who are the customers?**  So the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand.   **Tell me more, please.**  No problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at.   Alteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.  **Let's dig in for some numbers**  Annual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.  Q3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.  The company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&amp;D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.  **Balance Sheet**  Cash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1:1.5 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even black swans like covid.                 Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though.   Cash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%                              FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M)   So the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.  **Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**  &amp;#x200B;  [AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)  Well as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied.   So the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.  **Now we compare this company with other companies**     * SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~100x * DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 40x * MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 25x * **Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 15x** * JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 30x  * PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 50x  (thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)  As you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.  Gross Margin:  **AYX- 92%**  DDOG- 78%  SNOW - 55%  MongoDB- 69%  P/S Ratio:  **AYX-  16.95**  DDOG- 51.71  SNOW - 150.15  MONGODB-  30.88  PLTR - 47.76  AYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.  **TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.

Okay, so everyone keeps referring to the VW squeeze. That was nothing. 5x? Please.  **VW squeeze started at around €200 and went up to around €1000. That's only an increase of 400%.  GameStop has went up 400% in the last few months purely on sentiment and I guess hope, since Micheal Burry and Ryan Cohen got involved. GME went up 400% and the short interest barely budged. It actually went up a few times, and even now the short interest is *still* over 100%.  I think we can all assume, once and of all, that GameStop WILL squeeze more, possibly *far* more than VW did.**  Why aren't people talking about KBIO?  KBIO squeezed 10,000% from $0.44 to $44. However, it should be noted that Martin Shkreli *did* manipulate the market to trigger a short squeeze for personal gain. GME is different because the GameStop *is* actually a company recovering from a near bankruptcy situation with many new changes being implemented to their business model, as well as to their senior management. No one is manipulating anything here. All the people claiming ""illegal short squeeze"" are the same ones that said NIO would get delisted because it's a Chinese stock. Well, XPeng hit $72 recently. FUCKING XPENG. Sounds ugly. Is ugly. I don't understand it. Anyway, I digress. There is nothing illegal going on here. Shorts are just fucked and that's that.  Now, GME has *the* highest short interest on a stock ever seen. As far as I know, no other stock has ever been shorted more that 100%. Not even KBIO at the time when it squeezed.  I'm hoping/praying over here, and we might or might not see anything like KBIO, but we're definitely not gonna see +400% and call it a day. That's some bs, GME is gonna be the MOASS if it actually happens.   So...  **PRICE TARGETS:**  If, hypothetically, squeeze starts at market open today, starting at $16... and we have a squeeze of:  +500% = $96 +1000% = $176 +2000% = $336 +3000% = $496 +4000% = $656 +5000% = $816 +10000% = $1616  Now, these are obviously crazy numbers and this will *never* happen. The point of the demonstration is that **the price at which the the stock will end up after the squeeze will largely rely on when shorts exit**  If, hypothetically, shorts keep diamond handing like us until retailers' FOMOs &amp; YOLOs bring the price up to say $25:  +500% = $150 +1000% = $275 +2000% = $525 +5000% = $1275 +10000% = $2525  If shorts keep holding on until $30, even a +500% squeeze would put the price at $180.  I guess if it still hasn't started by the time we hit $30, I'll make another post with the next price targets🤣  **With all that being said, a very conservative market cap of $4bn would put GME at $61 without any short squeeze whatsoever.** I say this is conservative because GameStop's market cap in both previous console cycles was $8bn+. With the new changes implemented, share buybacks, pivot to e-commerce, cutting down non-profitable locations, etc etc etc., GameStop could actually end up being worth even more than ever before. Especially if Ryan Cohen ends up playing a bigger part. At its ATH valuation of $9bn, GME stock would be worth $138 a share. Even half of that is an upside of almost 300% from last closing price.  **GameStop is ready to start printing.** Yes, people have been saying it for months. The stock is up hundreds of percent in the last few months, yet *some* people are saying it's barely moving. Come on. Stop lying to yourself. Everyone, their grandma, and their dog is making money off this shit, and are about to make a shit ton more. Jump on the hype train.  **TLDR** It depends on when shorts exit. From there, if an actual short squeeze takes place, I believe we will see at least a few thousand percent gain over the course of a few days of very high volume. Absolute minimum you can expect if a sudden short squeeze started say, today, is about $96 per share ($16+500%). If you want to guarantee yourself a decent profit but don't want to risk missing the peak, start trimming your position at $100+ or about 2-3 days after it becomes CLEAR that shorts are covering in large quantities. If you're in this for the MOASS, DIAMOND HANDS TILL $500+ 💎   Once shorts start covering, you best believe their buddies are gonna jump ship too. The squeeze should play out over a couple of days. I would say stay in for 3 to 5 days? After that, if you're still in, start trimming your position at the very least or you'll get fucked when it inevitably plummets.

But what will happen is the share price will pop. Currently they have a shit load of cash. How come they have so much cash despite losing about 1b over the past 2 financial years and not raising money thru debt or equity.  Well some autist accountant back in the day decided to create some bullshit called double entry. GME bought some companies along the way which resulted in Goodwill. Which is basically the premium above net assets GME bought acquisitions for EB games ect.  As a result GME had a Profit of 74m total over the past 2 years before tax when you add back the goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairment over the last 2 years was roughly 1.3b.  Why is this important? Because the business for the past 2 years has been treated as a bankrupt despite actually holding its own in a digital era. If leadership manage to realise they can get out of most of the lease in the next 2 years and more to a online sale delivery plus pick up in store at foot traffic heavy locations / most profitable stores GME will remain profitable and cash flow positive for years to come.  TLDR; Adding back fake accounting lossing for the past 2 years results in a profitable company.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1630895|public|confidence|self|||GME ShortSqueeze is not happening, but GME is unvalued.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3k596/gme_shortsqueeze_is_not_happening_but_gme_is/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

They probably have an actual short position too (don't have to file that in an 13F) they're also underwater on. No one else has a put position this big in the 13F's.  What are the chances they're responsible for half the short interest? It'd make sense on why we're not seeing significant covering on GME yet. They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/u7ttqxuym8261.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b39a443a7d7cdc8d62ede4680a5b540af920f1d  &amp;#x200B;  Of course that $200 million bet would have turned to a $500 million (and growing) that they owe. They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.  **Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze. These boomers still think that digital consoles are going to kill Gamestop even though Microsoft threw them a safety net and that disc consoles are still the vast majority of sales. Surprise surprise, no one wants digital consoles in America when downloading a game uses up their entire bandwidth cap for the month.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1630357|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cEL1b_UplDnrpLn-T3bBGgb-evkI3Naskvc2Cucqm7Q.jpg|74.0|140.0|People pumping GME: Melvin Capital Management hates you a lot|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3gn91/people_pumping_gme_melvin_capital_management/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Typically large buyers will either buy in small chunks like 25k shares at a time or they will buy via dark pools.  It tends to be a really bad idea to purchase in such a massive block order.  I've been talking to a number of people for the last week about this, and it sounds like there really isn't a reason to ever do this.  &amp;#x200B;  The only reason I can come up with, is that the Board of Directors/Sherman are responding to Cohen's letter about allowing huge short interest to act like leeches.  If they are doing more buybacks, placing a huge order like that could be a sign/warning/fuck you to the short sellers.  Since Cohen hasn't updated his 13D since that happened, it couldn't be him (and wouldn't have made a ton of sense for him to do it either, as he would rather pay less for shares).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: I think the order was for share buybacks in response to Cohen's letter.

We know that GME is hot garbage in the long run. But this is WSB, where we’re looking to smash, not get married.   We also know the positive catalysts for GME in the short term:  1. New gaming cycle + holiday sales = $$$ 2. Earnings 12/8 3. Short interest is still around 130% (I genuinely don’t understand how dumb you’d have to be to short this company heading into a new gaming cycle) 4. Ryan Cohen 5. Short squeeze. Short squeeze. Short squeeze.   Conversely, there are some red flags on PLTR over the next couple of months that give me pause:  1. Citron is dumb, but it obviously affected price already 2. There *may* be issues after the lock up period expires, despite its active secondary market. Lockup ends the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir's financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020.

here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \*really\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?  I'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.  I've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.  **Here's the kicker**. \*Most\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of ""mooning"". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.  &amp;#x200B;  **XPEV**  Look at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.  https://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b  1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **CRSR**  https://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8  Next up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **LI**   https://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0  Next we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.  &amp;#x200B;  **PLTR**  https://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02  The PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.  &amp;#x200B;  **Conclusion**  What's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before. Once a few believers hop on the train the whole sub-reddit jumps on the bandwagon headed to hell or Valhalla."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1629617|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PLipM7ppZFk2OQebIjEC6zdoLnxe7Y-CaNQ4EJh3lko.jpg|72.0|140.0|Is the WallStreetBets sub-reddit fools gold or are we a diamond in the rough?

SHORT SQUEEZE MEANS MORE RETURNS THAN PLTR, NIO, XPEV, EVERY MEME STOCK COMBINED. GME** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  **Squeeze?**  Its  gotten to the point where short interest is over 100%, meaning that  more than 100% of the available shares of gamestop have been shorted.  How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from  the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share).  This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short  squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks  like when short interest exceeds 100%).  📷  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME  So  if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is  literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the  price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make  gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?  **Consoles**  Well,  the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the  consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators  that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a  metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily*  which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are  literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.  **Cohen**  Also,  they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed  with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made  him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help  pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which  means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors  that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately  trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the  BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to  take over soon.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)  📷  Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares.   **Positioning**  They  have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick  and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online  revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from  digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling  TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to  compete as an online retailer.  📷  https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517970/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games  [https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)  \^Link about TVs.  **The move:**  Buy  as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares  for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That  alone would be a 3,233% gain.  Important  note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short  squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump  after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be  a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips.  **TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**  edit\* positions are long 1,000 shares and more when I get my next paycheck.

George made huge changes to the company (e.g., hired a former president of Nintendo America in order to solve supply issues for Nintendo Switch during the beginning of Pandemic).  \- As a result, E-commerce revenue grew 500% YTY in Q1 2020 and 800% YTY in Q2 2020.  \- Ryan Cohen, a self-made Billionaire, who co-found Chewy .com shows interest in Gamestop and purchases 9.98% of GME shares.   \- Ryan Cohen recognizes the booming gaming industry and realizes the goldmine that Gamestop is sitting on with strong brand and 55million + PowerUp members.   \- Despite George Sherman’s proven success in E-comm sales, Ryan Cohen believes a more aggressive change needs to happen in order to make GameStop Great Again.  \- Ryan Cohen believes that in order to make GME Great Again, it is absolutely necessary for GameStop do the following:  1) Forgo the upcoming 2-year lease renewal on all underperforming stores  2) Non-core operations in Europe and Australia to be streamlined or sold.  3) By cutting cost with the above two methods and with the revenue generated from the biggest ever console cycle, GameStop should invest heavily on boosting E-comm sales.  (Hire proficient E-comm gurus, invest more in GME website and App, secure delivery channels that are better or at least on par with Amazon.

GameStop addresses Cohen’s letters and agrees to implement Cohen’s ideas.  2. GameStop completely disagrees with Cohen as they believe they are on the right track or doesn’t address Cohen’s letter at all.  \- Scenario 2 is where it could get interesting as many speculate a potential hostile takeover by Ryan Cohen.   My take on this:  \- Ryan Cohen is not a WSB autist. He sees the potential short squeeze opportunity. Ryan Cohen could be holding massive amount of ITM calls which he can exercise and reduce the supply of shares significantly. This way, he could easily takeover the company with the shares his holding and possibly even ride the short squeeze with us. This would force the shorts the cover. Similar to what happened in 2008 with Volkswagen.  [https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)  \- Or, Cohen could actually plan a hostile takeover and call up a proxy vote. This could lead to recalling shares by the company, forcing the shorts to cover and triggering the short squeeze.  Icing on the cake:  \- On 12/11/20, GameStop voluntarily pays off debt as their cash on hand deems healthy.

Very excited to see you all joining the rag-tag GME OGs that have been to sub $3 and back. Something does feel different this time.   I won’t rehash the story, just here with a friendly reminder about share lending:  1.	⁠GTC limit orders don’t do shit to inhibit lendability. GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS. 2.	⁠Shares held in cash accounts can only be lent with your explicit permission (e.g. enrollment into a lending program like @ IBKR, Schwab, etc.). When this starts going berserk they will reach out and offer you low at first, eventually ridiculous annualized interest rates to opt in. Look at the historical interest rates on iborrow during the proxy recall this Spring as a proof point. DO NOT!  3.	⁠Shares held in a margin account can and will be lent, unless you are NOT using any margin and the position is fully cash secured. If any portion of the position is no longer secured, the broker will assuredly be lending your GME. Those prime broker fuckers are frothing at the mouth to lend every share that exists (and then some, thanks to synthetic longs—see S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky’s excellent writeup here that specifically discusses GME: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/ ) They’ve been doing it for years (see my Twitter (RodAlzmann) for some charting on the shares short vs. price vs. short interest on max and other charts) and will gladly keep making $$$ off your shares.  That is all.

We should see some coverings next week, out of both fear going into earnings and just out of how much some of them will be losing. These last few moves have been mainly big buying rather than coverings, but that doesn’t matter too much. Black Friday sales were huge this year, just in general, so that should give us a bump. Technicals are pretty strong right now also. I personally think next week could be great, with a string of 10% days or around that, with some shorts covering. I think we could hit low 20’s next week, then Monday and Tuesday some profit taking before earnings and some more shorting since earnings are anticipated to be bad, like the recent GME earnings. Should have a nice dip right after ER, then from then on it’s all unprecedented. Cohen could buy GME on that dip, depending his plan, how much we dip, if we dip at all, and if he has funding to buy GME anyway. Vaccine approval should bump us a little as well, since GME is still seen as B&amp;M. I will be buying weekly 20c’s at open, but only becuase I’m very confident we go up a good amount next week, don’t do what I’m doing, IV and theta will hurt me.

For those of you who've been living under a rock, GME's short is currently more the entire number of outstanding shares. This is a very interesting, but the more important fact is that the number of shares sold short is roughly 3x the entire float.   https://preview.redd.it/udkkxz9ok1261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98f9645d9e2bf94dc3ccbd409f2d2b375be6d91  This is very important, as to cover short positions, MM's will have to buy from the float, the greater the Short % of Float, the greater the squeeze. In comparison, VW had a short float of just under 13% right before the insane short squeeze. Now, roughly 30-35% of VW shares were in the float, with Porsche holding 42.6%, the state of Lower Saxony holding 20%, and about 5-6% held by passive investors. This made the Short % of Float about 40%, far less than GME currently.  &amp;#x200B;  The short squeeze occurred because Porsche announced that they were going to exercise options to buy another 31.5% of the float, taking their total up to 74.1%, and had plans to hold 75% of VW the following year. This triggered a squeeze as shorts rushed to buy to cover before Porsche exercised the options. As you can see from the graph, VW's share price jumped nearly 5x, and then quickly fell back down.   https://preview.redd.it/p8720v4xm1261.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116f1045eacf3e73ecde3e44868b0867ca0b1231  A GME short squeeze will likely do the same thing, with possibly an even greater climb. However, this is no sure thing. To trigger the squeeze, GME would likely need to demonstrate long term profitability and growth. If MM's continue to believe GME's business model is dead, they will continue to be short as they can wait the 2 years it takes for GME to die.   &amp;#x200B;  As for the play, I personally think that GME is going to use the boost from console revenue to change its business model and help GME adapt to the tech age. With an already decent supply of cash (735 million as of 7/31/20), as well as major investors like Michael Burry (Big Short Guy) and Ryan Cohen (CHWY co-Founder) backing GME, all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze.   &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: Call leaps if you love to gamble your life savings, Shares if you're slightly less of a degenerate than the rest of us|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1627642|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vxFs_0xf-4FqPNm9FqqE68S6uLIiRAgPe-2yZOdDPsI.jpg|56.0|140.0|GME DD Because there wasn't enough of it already|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2vn0r/gme_dd_because_there_wasnt_enough_of_it_already/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

But I believe this is one of the better methods for maximizing returns while ensuring you don't get screwed when the train stops and the stock dumps 25% in a day.  Essentially what you do, is you buy a few slightly OTM calls dated at least 3-4 weeks out on a stock in meme status.  Sit on them until they go ITM and the value goes up substantially and then sell it, converting it into two new OTM calls for a similar distance out. The other important aspect is that there is leftover money after purchasing the two replacement calls.  &amp;#x200B;  Example, in CRSR I bought a feb call for 4, sold it for 17 and bought two new feb calls for 5 each.  This way, I was able to increase my call position, while recovering my initial investment and locking in 300 dollars in profit. I did this 3 times while it moved from 23 to 53.  Now, I have a much larger position in CRSR than I started with in terms of money/calls, but even if those become worthless, I still made a lot of money on the stock (this was all with slightly otm stocks, but further otm would work as well).  It removes the need to time the top and bottom etc.  As long as you get in early enough to do one flip, you make a profit  &amp;#x200B;  Again, this won't work as well for normal stock movements, but for these massive meme stocks it is a killer strategy.  It is especially important for GME, where it is poised to have the largest short squeeze in history with 125% of float shorted during a time where fomo is probably as high as any time in history.  We could squeeze to 40, or 400....no one really has any clue.  Once the squeeze ends, I would assume the stock price will dump back into the 30s.  Having a way to avoid having to sell at that point is important, and averaging out as it goes up runs the risk of missing out on massive profits. If someone else has a better strat, I'd love to hear it!  &amp;#x200B;  Please ask questions here, I'm happy to help, but I can't handle the number of DMs I've been getting lately, and I PROMISE someone else has the same question you do and would benefit from it being in the thread.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1627379|public|confidence|self|||How to ride momentum/meme stocks like PLTR/NIO/CRSR (and soon GME) without getting burned.|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2tg4h/how_to_ride_momentummeme_stocks_like_pltrniocrsr/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

That means you can say that BBY controls the TAM, market share for the card spend category. Which means it’s easy to see how things are going. Can’t wait to add in and see the PS5 #s in the next results.  TL/DR missed GME?

I've been browsing these autistic forums and all I see is multi-threads asking the same questions, asking about the same stocks, asking about the next big Yolo.  Here is everything summed up:  \*\*\* Edit \*\*\*  I forgot to add. This week there is a vote on legalizing MaryJ and there are plenty of stocks to choose from:  ACB - we all know the bread and butter of this one.  CGC - expensive out of all of them.  But the one I have my eyes on because its fairly cheap and has an announcement on December second is:  There is another stock that's currently trading under $1. I think there is a merger that is going to be announced soon. I plan on loading up on BOTH shares and CALLS 1/2$ strike for 2021. I feel that out of all Cannabis stocks this one has the best risk vs reward. Couldnt list the name here bc it is considered a banned ticket, probably because its a penny stock. Do your own DD.  \*\*\*\*\*  PLTR - clearly is this is the TSLA of AI/Data. We will most likely see a small pullback in the coming days as more autists lock in their gains, but this is an opportunity to buy shares at a discount and some cheaper calls far out into 2021 (35C + or higher). You can go ahead and buy some next week.  GME - If you look at GME's performance over last 20 years it has its best/high stock value at console release time. This year wont be any different and the tradition will continue. There is a lot of news about the activist investor / ex Chegg dude trying to restructure the company, huge short interest, cash on hand and early debt redemption. Expect GME to Sky rocket past 20$ before Christmas. TLDR: I bought 75 Jan 20C, will add more next week further out into March+.  SWIR - Sierra Wireless. Definitely a sleeper stock, but recent financial earnings/report have been good. Stock is current trading at a discount and options March and later are pretty cheap. I have 100x March 20C. I expect this one to creep slowly til then and surprise us again in February with Q4 earnings.  TSLA - Papa Musk is Jesus is human form. We should give thanks and praise for all the tendies he has rained unto this world. Until then, stay cautious, tesla is up 50% in like 2 weeks, it will most likely continue its climb up, but right now isnt the time to buy options, wait for a pullback b/c they are too expensive.  MP - plenty of posts about rare earth elements. This is a long term play, I dont expect it to rally as hard as PLTR but its a good side stock to own, potential have some contracts, but they are pricey. I would wait for a retracement first.  CRSR - the make quality gaming accessories. If you missed the run from 15$ to 50$, fear no more, this pullback is a blessing in disguise. I am targetting a pullback to 30$ before loading up on shares and far dated calls. This should be trading and eventually catchup to LOGI.  Feel free to add other ideas. These are my current plays.

Rational people think it can’t double AGAIN, idiots don’t know when to stop making memes &amp; pushing it with unconditional faith of it hitting 1,000% gains, and retards make the profits.    See NIO- NIO’s “phase 3” happened around the $26-$35 range.  Solid increase from there.   See GME- their phase 3 happened around the $11 mark- now up to $16.     Phase 1: WSB mentions a stock in DD and someone makes a meme about it, but 95% don’t have a clue about the company, but enjoy the hype.    Phase 2: The stock makes more than 50% gains, and it officially becomes a “meme” stock.  95% of people still don’t know much about it, but Google the ticker.  And watch a few memes. This is where n’orniez think that there will be a pullback from a 50-100% gain &amp; don’t jump on board.  Retards jump all in and see another 50% gain.     Phase 3:  contention.  At this point, the stock has at least doubled, probably tripled since its first meme.  There is some profit taking, maybe a pullback (10-25%) but the memes don’t stop.  It get good coverage, it gets bad coverage, but all attention is good.  Can last for 1 day to 2 weeks. Then resumes at least a 30% gain from its last high.  Real wall street is forced to enter real positions in it.     Phase 4:  Latency. Big money bought in high, refuses to sell and be the bag holder, just waits for the next round of hype to take gains, or ride higher.  (NIO is here, GME is here with the short squeeze).

We all know Gamestop is going to crash it's business model is dead. But so does everyone else. In fact nearly everyone is shorting the shit out of it. Even your wife's bf and Cramer is shorting the fuck out of it.   [There is more shorts than outstanding shares!](https://preview.redd.it/up5ukv9180261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb5140a7bd7a1d84494f89d99d2d792e3b6a267)  There are just a bit more shorts than outstanding shares, and nearly 3 times more than the floating shares. Which means those assholes will need to close their positions and buy back their shares. But what is going to happen is that there is not enough supply float. So the price will skyrocket faster than PLTR or NIO or any other meme in 2020.  Right but what if they don't want to close their shorts all at once. Then nothing happens, right? Yes... and no. As they start buying back the price will rise slowly and some people that did not want to buy will at some point get a margin call. This will force more short sellers to buy (at a lose cause fuck gay bears). And this will accelerate the rising of the price creating more margin calls and so on and so on. Until we run out of short sellers trying to buy. At this point the price will stop increasing. Basically, we only need a small (comapared to 22.70 Mill) amount of people buying to trigger this.  So there is still a thing that needs to happen a small amount of people need to suddenly buy or close the shorting positions. For the price to start going up. Then here is the best part. GME earnings are happening on the 8th of December. Two things can happen either they ace it and people start buying or they screw it up and the price goes down.  First scenario it's golden the price starts rolling and GME goes to the moon. The second one sounds bad, right? No, if the price drops by 20% some people might start closing their shorts. Then as that happens the price will bounce back and start the process again.  Basically GME is a ball at the top of the hill right now. If only a bit of wind blows is going to start rolling.  Not only that but imagine if we all buy some shares we can show the market who is in control! Fuck Cramer fuck the bears. It is only 22 million shares, we are 1.6m we could even trigger the squeeze if we wanted to...|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1627075|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QcsB9233lTvhB-x-CIjWPdj8ZOvq44eag8ZEn18C3yU.jpg|56.0|140.0|Ok boys GME is rocket ship and it is nearly fueled enough (What is a short squeeze?)|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2qhdg/ok_boys_gme_is_rocket_ship_and_it_is_nearly/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Buy shares of GME because the short interest on the stock is greater than the total number of shares available.  In preparation for this I have sold my blood plasma. If you need capital it’s a great way to get some. You can give plasma at a plasma center twice a week with at least a day in-between. These places are paying more for blood plasma then they ever have before because of the high demand caused by the pandemic. Where I live, you currently receive a minimum of $70 each time plus the occasional bonus of $20. So some weeks I net $180 for 2 visits, 49mins each time. I’ve been doing this since April to buy shares of PLTR. I’m doing my part to keep this Rocket Ship fueled.

Given the fact that many of us already burned ourselves with weed stonks, I am not suggesting buying a single stonk option, instead buy the f&amp;@king industry, **$MJ.**    Almost every single sign is looking bullish on the daily chart. For example, we had: *high volume* breakout, *backtest*, *higher highs-lows*, strong momentum, and we closed on the high on Friday (big green dildo candle). The only risk we have is an unfilled gap between 14.03 and 13.60 and an overbought RSI, which represents some downside risk, but we all know these weed stonks, they don't give a f&amp;@k about RSI. Even if we fill that gap, I will just use the opportunity to buy more calls.  [daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/fswfa10rgz161.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb363e09a9073d7494556ec89edbb49fe909872a)  You might wonder, what about the mid and long-term...  Well, I can tell you that the weekly chart is even more bullish. *RSI* still has plenty of room to go and it's *rising* steadily. MACD just broke resistance, *momentum* is extremely strong. If we can get above 15.37 on Monday, we will literally go to the freaking **Moon**! My price target is between 22.82-24.10 (**52% upside potential**). *IV* is still *low*, compared to the last 2 week's high.

SHORT SQUEEZE MEANS MORE RETURNS THAN PLTR, NIO, XPEV, EVERY MEME STOCK COMBINED. GME** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  &amp;#x200B;  **Squeeze?**  Its gotten to the point where short interest is over 100%, meaning that more than 100% of the available shares of gamestop have been shorted. How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%).   [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)  So if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?  **Consoles**  Well, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.  **Cohen**  Also, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon.   [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)  &amp;#x200B;  [Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **Positioning**  They have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer.   [https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/10\/15\/21517970\/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://preview.redd.it/cijd0o25xw161.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310955852b0224bfff2fc36825d50a741475f46c)  [https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)  \^Link about TVs.   **The move:**  Buy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.    Important note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1626038|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8yFfqOGZgyNkaynhJ2ywfWrdu9fQDTel3a3m_GmuMVc.jpg|14.0|140.0|It isnt a meme, its a solid play.

His dollar general website is complete garbage, and if some weird AF NEET can move markets by waving his magic dildo on opening market then we can do it too.  I need serious DD investors who would want to participate and make blogs about who can write better than birthday cards with crayons.  The website will focus on meme stocks only.

PS you don't get paid anything except a chance to meet Jim Cramer at some point or get under Kevin O'Learys desk for 5mins of air time.  In honor of Palantir and Peter Thiels love of LOTR the website will be named [BalrogResearch.com](https://BalrogResearch.com) I'll redirect it to WSB for now.  if you are interested in creating blogs on serious DD please send an email to  [WallStreetBets@GladrielResearch.com](mailto:WallStreetBets@GladrielResearch.com) and post   1.

Let's say you bought at $3000 and are hoping to sell at $4000. One morning you wake up and open your Robinhood, and to your dismay, the price of AMZN has fallen to $2000. You freak out and decide to sell quickly to minimize your losses. The highest bid you find is $1998 and you sell at that price. You decreased the price by 2 extra dollars. So by increasing the supply of AMZN, you (and millions of other scared AMZN holders) add to the momentum of the price falling.  A short squeeze is kinda similar but in the opposite direction:  First, let's see how a short position works. You short a stock when you expect its price to fall and you want to profit from the decline. Assume the current price of AAPL is $120 and you expect it to fall to $100. So you go to a bank and say can I borrow 1 share of AAPL in exchange for some interest? They give you the share. You immediately sell it at $120. Later when the price of AAPL falls to $100, you buy 1 AAPL and return it to the bank. You are left with a $20 profit (minus the interest you paid).  Now, what if you have a short position (you borrowed 1 AAPL from the bank when the price was $120 and sold it at $120 immediately) and one day you wake up and see the price is $150. You freak out and decide to close your short position, meaning that you want to buy an AAPL as soon as possible and return it to the bank. The lowest ask price you find is $152. You buy at that price, thereby increasing the price of the stock by 2 more dollars. So you, and many other scared shorters, increase the demand for the share, adding momentum to the rise in price.  What if there are many many short positions, even more than the shares that are available to be sold? Then the many shorters who want to close their short position face a limited number of ask prices. A shorter buys at $151. Then the lowest available ask is $155. That is bought in a second too. Next one is $160.. and so on. Very quickly, the ask prices are going to be eaten out and the price will rise to levels unimaginable before. This is what we call a short squeeze.  TLDR: buy GME.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1625509|public|confidence|self|||Short squeeze explained for room-temperature IQ|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2d80b/short_squeeze_explained_for_roomtemperature_iq/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

It was still 3x off March lows though (sound familiar?????!!!??) so no one was crazy to buy the discounted shares. Then earnings came and blew expectations. GME also expects amazing earnings even though Q3 only goes to October.  https://preview.redd.it/9klgx6qglt161.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089b8574fce09f1c494c3e1806bdd1db7f7d72c8  Also the short interest is over 100% of the outstanding shares. What does that even mean? It means it's going to be like ACB a few weeks ago **without the risk of holding fucking ACB** (because GME has more cash than debt, and they're paying off their 2021 bonds early already).  What did ACB do? **Short squeeze, duhh.** You didn't actually think a shitty company like ACB went up +300% because of fundamentals did you?  https://preview.redd.it/j2dk8y5lmt161.png?width=1519&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f544ee5e5c5db0a189ada8177dd96349b974fa86  And finally, hot girls on stocktwits are jumping in on it too.

He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, starting with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.  To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent.  Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction. He alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset.  Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds.  First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry.  Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.   https://preview.redd.it/dlcrcieaps161.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04750e69de84d6760650b2d7761de308576522e4|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1623188|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RoxajC75h-bsgvfFbotpsOv_dkERjeSsMIx7Lfos7d4.jpg|93.0|140.0|GAMESTOP WONTSTOP POPPING|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k22g2s/gamestop_wontstop_popping/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Say a company is trading at $10 and you buy a 30c expiring in a week but the probability of it actually hitting the 30 strike is almost 0. The stock price jumps up to $20 and your option also increases in value.  Why does that option increase in value if its almost guaranteed that strike wont be hit? And what does the person who buys it from you plan to do with it?  Current example: people are buying 30c expiring 12/4 for GME. Who buys those calls when they go to sell for a profit especially when it’s so far OTM. Or am I just seriously underestimating how much the price could jump in a few days?

The best way to donate to charity is to send them your best performing shares of stock. That way you don’t pay taxes on any of your gains, and the charity is allowed to sell the stock immediately upon receipt and they don’t pay any taxes either.   Steps to do this:  1. Find the charity’s brokerage account information online or send them a message asking for it. The instructions should include information to perform a Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) transfer  2. Call your broker or send them a secure message online to provide them with the DTC instructions, including the ticker symbol, number of shares, and specifically which shares or all shares of a stock holding that you’re looking to donate 3. Your brokerage will take a few hours up to a few days, and the shares will disappear from your account. The charity will then send you a receipt for the entire value of shares that you sent them, which is tax deductible against the rest of your tendies for the year  Example scenario: I bought $2k shares of NIO that are up 200%. I donated the $6k of stock to charity, so instead of having to pay taxes on $4k in gains I instead get to deduct the entire $6k on my taxes.  Example of a few DTC instructions for charities:  1. Food bank example since it’s the holidays/Thanksgiving - Food Bank of Silicon Valley: https://www.shfb.org/give-help/stock-gifts/ 2. The founder of the ice bucket challenge passed away last weekend, so you could also give to ALS research (Lou Gehrig’s disease). This is a disease that has personally impacted my family as well: https://www.als.org/get-involved/ways-give/information-securities-brokers  Caveats:  1. Some of the newer, smaller brokers might not be setup to donate shares via DTC, so you’ll have to check with your broker to see if it will work. All of the traditional brokers like eTrade, Fidelity, etc are setup to handle this process 2. Options are not a good idea to send because of the potential volatility and liquidity that is forced upon the charity. So more liquid, straightforward instruments like regular common stock such has PLTR, NIO, GME is the best way to donate   PS.

I know many of you, myself included, are jacking it to the thought of infinite tends from the GME short squeeze.  Problem is, unlike those bosses u/DeepFuckingValue and u/Sir_Jack_A_Lot  many of you retards are poor as shit, and can't afford the shares necessary to become overnight millionaires when this bitch squeezes to infinity.  Yeah, you might make some tendies on the meager 10 shares you bought with the allowance your wife's boyfriend gave you, but who cares if you become a thousandaire, you'll just lose that shit next week.  I'm gonna walk you all through how we can harness the collective power of WSB autism, stick it to the MMs , and gobble up all the tendies.  At this point you may be asking how are we going to pump this bitch to infinity, were just a modest collection of 1.6M retards?  My answer is simple, and something you all should understand: FDs.    Way OTM weeklies are cheap as shit, every week I have been buying 20 30C for the current week, and the following week.  If you find the right ask, you can get them for $1 each.  If this squeezes, I walk away rich, if it doesn't Im out max $40.    If we all start buying up all the OTM weeklies we can, it will force the MMs that sell them to hedge, this means they will need to buy roughly 20% of the shares, which reduces the float, which accelerates the squeeze.  One autist buying 20 FDs won't move the market, but 1.6M may just have a chance.   Godspeed, my fellow retards, lets all hop aboard that train to Tendie Town.  TLDR: Buy weekly GME 30C at .01.

Hello WSB,  I want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc.   I encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.  Part 1: Sell Puts  I sold a Put at $30 strike price expiring in 1/15/2020. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2020, then some of my loses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price.   Part 2: Buy Calls  The next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2020. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point.   Part 3: Forced Buying  Market Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Gama changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge.   Part 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity  GME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2020, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options).   It is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.  Risk Mitigation  If we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaire off of GME.  If GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta.   If GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.

Picked a couple stocks occasionally but a couple stocks here and there doesn't make you any money so I quit it. Just recently I decided to get back into picking stocks when I started hearing abount Robinhood all the time, going for some growth/all or nothing plays. I can afford to lose a little money and I had low expectations. Well that was also the same time that I started seeing some WSB posts hit the front page. I had no fucking clue what I was laughing at but I was laughing. WSB memes are a gateway drug.    $2,500 into RH. Bought WRK shares - a cardboard play - everyone is buying online, there is cardboard all over my house and all over my office. They were underperforming peers, got hit with the COVID, and the five of 10 bullets I read in their 10 point or whatever COVID recovery plan seemed good enough. Solid DD. Went in on Mercado Libre. Boring but solid growth.    After laughing at all you degenerate fucks for a few months I thought to myself, yeah I should buy an option, without doing any research whatsoever. It's one option MIchael, how much could it cost? I purchased my first option. WRK $45C 12/18. Immediately went red. Didn't care. I needed more. First I had to figure out what the fuck an option was and figure out a better strategy. I knew I was ready when I could finally understand the shitposts. God damn I laugh my ass off reading this sub. And not just a little huff through the nose, like actual laughing. Joy I haven't felt in so long.    I kept losing more on FDs. I didn't even know what an FD was. I just looked that up yesterday, but apparently that's what I was doing and I am the reason it's called an FD. In bed I would just look at who had earnings coming up and buy calls. I was getting fucked by my stupid plays. V, ACTI, ADM (what the fuck is that even? Bunch of soy bean farms. Who cares???), IP (more fucking cardboard). These stocks are not going to move. Just chipping away at my nut but I was expecting to lose so keep going right? Truly retarted.    Then who came along? NIO. Fucking NIO. Made some money on calls while it was going from 20&gt;30. Made back my losses and then some. Now I'm main lining heroin. Well shit now I know wtf to do right? Just do whatever WSB is doing. Now I'm staring at RH at work for 30 minutes straight thinking about selling one contract and reading posts on the shitter. Made money on CRSR. Made money on SOLO in the brief period it was popular and killed it on that trade. Now PLTR is fucking gold. I've bought and sold FDs. I'm in on a LEAP. I'm in for stock. TO🚀. THE🚀. MOON. 🚀   Now I can't sleep sometimes thinking about my plays that day and the plays I have to monitor the next day. I spend all the god damn zoom meetings I'm in all day staring at tickers. This should not be happening given the amount of money I'm playing with. I've got no positions worth more than a couple hundred bucks. I'm losing sleep over missing out on $20. SO FUCK YOU. BUT ALSO THANKS FOR MAKING ME MONEY, GETTING ME TO LEARN SOME NEW STUFF, FEELING LIKE PART OF THE GANG, AND MOSTLY MAKING ME LAUGH. In 48 days I'm up 75% thanks to WSB (mostly PLTR). I'm going to keep building this nut a bit then YOLO that bitch into a TESLA on whatever meme stock comes next.   There was a post a few weeks ago about people making fancy posts to pump stocks and leaving my retard self holding the bag. Well fuck that. If your DD has bold, paragraphs, some 🚀🚀🚀, and a position then I'm 100% in.   Positions:  GME $15c 11/27  PLTR $30c 12/18, $35c 11/19/21  WRK $45c 12/18  ACTI $100c 1/15/21 (stupid)  Shares in a bunch of the SPACs mentioned, WRK, and of course PLTR.

GME dips after earnings, Cohen tender offer. Mega squeeze.   2. GME Spikes big after earnings, which will only rly Happen if Cohen is mentioned in the plan for the future and has found a place in GME, squeeze begins, however not as violent, still awesome though.   3. Cohen tender offer BEFORE earnings. This would happen if Cohen believes earnings will be good and doesn’t want to offer after a spike in price.    Now the most probable scenario imo is Cohen buying right after earnings. Pfizer vaccine will likely be approved a few days after earnings, Cohen would not want to wait after this to buy and end up having to offer at a higher price. Also, with Christmas sales coming, he won’t want to risk a run up of GME before he buys.    Technicals are strong af and IWM is ripping.    Just buy GME.

Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.  AAPL is the next TSLA.  TSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up.   ""Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout.""   ""If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?"" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)  ""This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?  ""This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.""  Only one of these is true. And is why I present to you all 🍎.  Apple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features.   Apple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.  Let me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?  ""I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tandem about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost""  Shrooms are fucking amazing.  Back to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?  ""What will be the catalyst?"" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.  ""But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-"" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.  I can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.  If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time.    Positions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. AAPL 11/27 125C. Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.  TL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie.

""This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.""  Only one of these is true. And is why I present to you all 🍎.  Apple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share similar features.   Apple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.  Let me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?  ""I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tandem about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this DD""  Shrooms are fucking amazing.  Back to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?  ""What will be the catalyst?"" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.  ""But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-"" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.  I can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.  If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time.    Positions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. AAPL 11/27 125C. Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.  TL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie.

He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, starting with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a  high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.  To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent.  Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction. He alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset.  Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds.   First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry.   Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.   POSITIONS: JAN 25C, 30C AND SHARES  **Stock Market Value**: $828 million ($12.71 per share)  ## Activist: Ryan Cohen  **Percentage Ownership:** 9.98%  **Average Cost:** $5.98  **Activist Commentary:** Cohen is not an activist but an extremely successful entrepreneur. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company [Chewy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CHWY), which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen’s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.  ## What’s Happening:  On Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company’s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.  ## Behind the Scenes:  Cohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.  Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.  However, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.  To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as [Advance Auto Parts](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAP), [Best Buy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY) and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.  The company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023.   Cohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two — and probably three or more — new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.  If this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.  It will be interesting to see if the board will be able to stomach the change necessary to propel GameStop into the 21st century.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:  *GME, which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.  *PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2, currently trading at $17.85.  *BBBY, 1 million shares bought around $10.60, currently trading at $20.24 *CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.

Mr. Bale added a whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.  What is LUMN, you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.   A lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days. COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.   Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the ""4IR"", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.  Some of their business exposure includes:   *Adaptive Network Systems *Advanced Collaboration Platforms *AI Driven Adaptive Threat Intelligence *Edge Computing *Hybrid Cloud Networks  Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?   [reddit!](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)LUMN  **Financials:**  *Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.   *EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.  *Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.   *Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.  *Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.  But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

Of course, and it always will be– But you can do better.  Walking into Game-stop in your cum-stained pajamas and realizing you’re the only customer in the store doesn’t justify going all-in on weekly GME $10P’s. Y’all’s blindness to your own confirmation bias is comparable to Stevie Wonder Shorting Luxottica because he’s convinced his glasses don’t work.     Be conscious of your biases and actively weed them out. Don’t ignore certain information because it contradicts your hypothesis, and don’t exclusively seek favorable information!  “See things for what they are and not for what you want them to be”  The truth is: “The less we deserve good fortune, the more we hope for it.”  I’m aware this place isn’t named “Wallstreet Bond Investing,” and for a good reason. That would be more fucking boring than analyzing financial statements, forecasting market conditions, researching industries, and learning how a specific company even makes money—But that’s exactly what it’ll take to flip your short, yellow-busses 180 degrees into the direction of Tendie-Town.   How about instead of pulling Scrabble tiles from your asses, you develop an educated opinion by performing top-down analyses. Perform your own research on the broader economy and identify how it may impact certain sectors, then industries, then companies. IDENTIFY viable investment opportunities, don’t take stabs in the dark and hope to get paid– Otherwise, you may very well end up getting paid... to take stabs in the dark (gay-prostitute joke).

(Tagged one earlier). But today was overall very bullish for GME. We sustained the breakout and closed above 12.70. today was a bit weird Becuase of OPEX and MM’s were obviously trying to destroy options by pinning the price at 12.70. Also, we’ve stopped following IWM, before these last few days, movement was heavily influenced by the Russel 2000 movement, which was annoying as fuck. But we seem to be out of that, and out of the range that we’ve been in for about 3 weeks now.    Also, idk how much more I have to say this but, the squeeze isn’t something that starts suddenly. I see people always ask “is it happening?!? GME squeeze starting?!?” After a morning spike. No, the squeeze isn’t starting yet, it needs a catalyst, which will likely be Cohen buying out GME.

This book is a true story of how one boy leveraged 100-to-1 and successfully became a millionaire many times over. He buys a yacht, takes lavish vacations, and eventually has enough money to influence market movements.  *• 1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the bid–ask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at bucket shops.*   This is where your average WSB autist starts. Robinhood is essentially the modern day “bucket shop” where people buy and sell stock based on tips they hear as well as crude technical analysis tools. Instead of 100-to-1 leverage, we use options.  *• 1910-1920: Livermore was a stock trader on the New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.*  Even the great traders of our time lost it all more than once. The most useful lesson is to trim down your leverage and do not “revenge trade”. You need to stay in the right state of mind at all times. The moment you start thinking “I just lost a house payment” it is too late. The money in your account needs to feel like points in a game. It is much better to play the odds and lose on the right play than win money on pure luck.  *• 1920s: Livermore engaged in market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.*   This is where the big dogs are now. Read this section and learn how the market manipulation works. It was the same back then as it is today. Large players will test the market, find resistance, and manipulate the price to sell into retail strength. A lot of posts on this sub are part of pumping and dumping stocks. Remember that you are following the Big Dogs to tendies, and you need to get out before your favorite meme stock leaves you bag-holding.

Cover your positions, sell your puts. GME is now showing a very positive uptrend.   Stop thinking they are going bankrupt anytime soon. Just paid $125M EARLY.  Cohen, who owns almost 10%, just sent a letter to Management via the press calling them out for a dramatic transformation. The letter doesn't say it directly but is implied that if you don't do it I will force it to happen.  Huge Short Interest - I am not calling out a Short Squeeze (although that would be epic). An good piece of news will be the match lighting the fuse.  Fair Value of GME - $20-25/share. Buy shares and watch them double in the next 30 to 90 days.

And the way companies in the sector make money has changed rapidly over the years.  With new consoles from [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) and [Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=6758.T-JP) [on sale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/15/microsoft-looks-beyond-the-console-wars-with-new-xbox.html), there’s a clear push from both companies deeper into software and subscriptions — similar to the way [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL) has placed a greater emphasis on services in recent years.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  They’re hoping to capitalize on [rising demand for games](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/video-games-sales-soar-as-coronavirus-leaves-millions-trapped-at-home.html) as consumers around the world spend more time at home during the coronavirus pandemic. But a viral pandemic isn’t the only thing that’s changed the gaming industry recently.  According to Daniel Ahmad, analyst at Niko Partners, consoles are now a much more profitable business for firms like Microsoft, Sony and [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=7974.T-JP) than they were a decade or two ago.  “We’re now moving to a point where hardware is profitable, software has always been profitable and network services are playing a much larger role in keeping people within the console gaming ecosystems,” he told CNBC’s “[Beyond the Valley](https://www.cnbc.com/beyondthevalley/)” podcast.  Digital distribution of games has allowed firms to rake in bigger profit margins than selling physical copies in stores, Ahmad said. Whereas publishers would traditionally make about $35 on a $60 game sold in-store, online downloads mean they can now make as much as $45 per game.  Sony and Nintendo [have reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/nintendo-q1-earnings-profits-surge-428percent-animal-crossing-sales-double.html) much higher digital download numbers this year. That trend looks likely to continue, with both Microsoft and Sony selling digital-only versions of their new consoles at lower prices.  ## Ecosystem  So-called gaming ecosystems are set to become even more important over the next few years. Microsoft, for example, is betting heavily on building out its player base across a range of different devices, including its Xbox consoles, Windows PCs and smartphones.  The company [released its xCloud gaming service](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/microsoft-xcloud-release-for-android.html) commercially in September as part of its Xbox Game Pass subscription platform. Cloud gaming lets users play a game that’s streamed to their device from a company’s remote infrastructure. Such services are typically available through paid subscriptions, similar to [Netflix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=NFLX) but for games rather than TV shows and movies.  “We think of the console as something that is always going to be part of gaming, because what it does is it effectively gives someone the flagship experience,” Sarah Bond, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of gaming ecosystem, said in an interview for “Beyond the Valley.”  “But the other thing we’ve seen — and there really has been a rise in this over the last 10 years — is people wanting to game across devices,” she added. “So the console plays that role as part of an ecosystem where people can actually game anywhere.”  Japanese rival Sony, meanwhile, is pitching the PS5 as an all-in-one system that gives players access to its exclusive games as well as its PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now subscriptions services, which offer online gaming, some free titles and cloud gaming.  Analysts say the PS5′s predecessor, the PlayStation 4, largely beat Microsoft’s Xbox One console due to the number of exclusive games it sells. Sony’s in-house studios have produced several popular franchises, such as God of War and The Last of Us.  **The ability for games to generate huge amounts of revenue over the long term is going to be really important to a lot of these platform owners.Daniel AhmadANALYST, NIKO PARTNERS**  Nintendo similarly takes advantage of its vast catalog of intellectual property, with series like Animal Crossing and Super Mario selling [multi-million hits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-and-coronavirus-led-to-record-sales.html) on its Switch console.  The company stands out as it’s less concerned with Microsoft and Sony’s next-gen console battle, choosing instead to ride a wave of continued demand for the Switch. However, it hasn’t missed out on the rush toward subscriptions and services, using its paid Nintendo Switch Online feature to drive additional sales from software.  ## Big Tech  Now, other tech giants are stepping on gaming companies’ turf. [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL), [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) and [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB) have all released their own cloud gaming services, looking to carve out a share of the $160 billion games market.  Niko Partners’ Ahmad said there are two main strategies coming out of Big Tech: On the one hand, Google and Amazon are trying to compete with the likes of Steam and Epic Games as digital game distribution platforms themselves. On the other, Facebook is using game streaming as an advertising tool.  “How that works is, you’re scrolling through your Facebook feed and you can instantly jump into and experience a game,” he said. “If you like that experience, you can click to play and play more on the device of your choice instantly. In consoles, you can do that through instant demos; download a game instantly without downloading it.”  For now, cloud gaming is mainly seeing adoption among console gamers who want to continue playing the titles they enjoy on other devices, Ahmad said. It’s going to be an opportunity for tech companies of all stripes to take advantage of the growth in mobile gaming, which now accounts for almost half of the entire market, according to Newzoo.  Microsoft, a company valued at $1.6 trillion, sees cloud gaming and subscriptions as a chance to drive more users toward its content. The company recently bought Bethesda Softworks, the video game publisher behind hit franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, for $7.5 billion.  “Content is key to people driving our gaming subscription, and it’s something that people look for,” said Bond, who added that Bethesda’s content would help “accelerate” growth of its Game Pass subscription service.  Ahmad thinks there could be more consolidation on the horizon: “The ability for games to generate huge amounts of revenue over the long term is going to be really important to a lot of these platform owners.”  &amp;#x200B;  When I see consoles being mentioned, my autistic brain thinks of GME.

rather going to be summary of what happened to GME.  1.The smartest autist in the world Dr. Michael Burry is still in the game and in June this year, he voted to back the board.  &gt;""Scion believes CEO George Sherman, appointed by the Board in 2019, is progressing quickly in reshaping GameStop to thrive into and beyond the coming console upgrade cycle. Scion believes that under Sherman, GameStop is approaching its own reboot in a sensible and innovative manner. Scion noted that Sherman, along with CFO Jim Bell, have revamped working capital management for improved efficiency. Most crucially, it appears to Scion that GameStop is now succeeding in transforming vendor partnerships to unlock high-margin revenue streams. Scion believes that this is a direct result of current management's expertise and focus and is a complete gamechanger for GameStop beyond the coming console upgrade. ""  Basically he says new board is adaptable to change and he believes current board can ""reboot"" Gamestop.  2. Ryan Cohen- the guy who beat amazon by selling dog and cat supplies, sent angry letter to Gamestop board to adapt to new era of digital gaming this week. He acknowledges that with the console cycle, Gamestop will have better revenue streams. However, he calls the board members to close the non-profitable stores and adapt to new era of gaming.  He ended the letter with urging board members to quickly announce roadmap for future.  &gt;"" In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve. ""  And Ryan Cohen is a bad motherfucker who turns stone into gold.  &gt;""I look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. That was true at Chewy too in terms of just programming all of our executives that generally the best answer is no. As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.""  This dude saw Gamestop and he saw potential. And we have this guy on our side. His fund owns 9.98% share of Gamestop.  If coherent roadmap is announced soon, it will open big bull case for Gamestop's future. Most likely, they will have official communication on their earnings day when announcing their guidance.  3. Mobile gaming. Ryan Cohen mentions huge mobile gaming market in his letter to Gamestop board.  &gt;""The explosion of mobile. ""  Gamestop is aware of this and they are trying to create community of mobile gamers. Recently, they've partnered with Niantic to attract Pokemon Go players.  4. Partnership with Microsoft . It's a developing story, we do not know full details of the deal. However, it's been rumored that Gamestop will help Microsoft to sell more Microsoft products through their stores (Gamestop has around 5000 stores). And Microsoft will give portion of their digital sales to Gamestop on Xboxes purchased from Gamestop. I think this is honorable attempt to rob some PS5's market share.  [Source: Gamestop partnership with Microsoft](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)  5. Undervalued on paper.  &gt;""GameStop has over $5 a share in net cash and over $12 a share in cash, making it an extremely undervalued security given expected positive future cash flows from the next generation console cycle. ""  Source: Seeking Alpha (reddit won't let me link seekingalpha)  6. Short Squeeze.  Well fuck this. Y'all know all the itty bitty about this, and read how it could shoot GME to the Mars like SpaceX.  Personally, I think any good news, any growth opportunity will shoot the stock up, and there are too many potential catalyst.

After hours trading closed at $11.52 last night, and as of writing this, the price is sitting at $12 in premarket trading with a total volume of **51** (in premarket). Even if we assume that all **51** shares we bought and not sold, that's an increase of 4.17% from **51** shares bought.  65 day average volume is 11+ million, yesterday's volume was 3+ million, yet the price is refusing to move past $12. That can only be explained by one thing. There is still a ridiculous amount of short selling happening. We need to buy and hold GME and lock up as many shares as possible.

I had a biz professor that would say he knew he had a good business when the customers hated him, coz it meant they have no alternatives.

Paragraph that caught my eye and confirms my GME bullish bias  Friedman: You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from the process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?  Cohen: For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those “no”s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.  Most investors couldn’t get past two hurdles: competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble. But I was convinced being focused on the pet category along with high-touch customer service gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. Pets.com was a good idea but a decade too soon and without sufficient scale to cover their costs. These two hurdles didn’t scare me. I never considered changing my business plan. One highly respected venture capitalist told me he would be more interested if we were selling live pets over the internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he believed running into Amazon’s teeth was suicidal.  I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way.

Q2 total sales (including retail) were \~942m for GME. So this will be a huge quarter for them. One big assumption he's made is that orders will continue at this rate for the entire Q4, when actually they could decrease or even increase dramatically - this remains to be seen as the holiday season progresses. I believe as more next gen console stock is available, daily order rates will increase. I also think basket size is underestimated.  &amp;#x200B;  Potential Upcoming Catalysts:  \- Sony/Nintendo partnership  \- Console sales figures  \- Blockbuster sales figures for gaming - watch NPD reports  \- Debt rating upgrade after voluntary retiring of 60%+ of their debt  \- Trade-in business picks up as more people trade in their old consoles for credit on new consoles  \- E-commerce boom  \- The new advertising business is mentioned in earnings  \- Entering huge PC gaming market - parts, components, accessories  \- enter E-Sports market  \- Fastest growing gaming market, ever  \- COVID vaccine, increasing mall footfall, increased sales  \- Increased institutional ownership  \- Large short interest   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Positions:  GME duh|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1593228|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/asx2s7pXdIHXzgUAJQtesw1brOYoYObWx4ldSQmzWqA.jpg|77.0|140.0|Estimated ~70,000 orders per day on their E-commerce platform for 4Q20, HUGE upside potential with limited downside risk|1|[]|0.92|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jv08ec/estimated_70000_orders_per_day_on_their_ecommerce/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

GameStop: Still waiting on a catalyst, but [IV is surging](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-133901115.html). When GME first started making its rounds, every post had a target date of January. This target is still good as we will see Black Friday sales as well as GME earnings and Christmas sales as well. There is bound to be a catalyst. Check out options activity for clues. A lot of deep ITM puts – someone is accumulating GME shares.  EV Gang: Looks like a great run, but I saw multiple WSB commenters arguing that NIO stock was fairly valued because they would be more productive than Tesla in 2032. If you are pricing to perfection for the next 12 years to justify today’s price, then it may be a good idea to take profits.  Vale: Dead meme – last post mentioning this company. However, if WSB is so confident on EVs, it may be better to sell shovels during a gold rush.  Palantir: Wow! Amazing price action! Great numbers on their recent earnings report and institutions are waking up. I don’t see any direct catalysts through December, but we may see sustained demand since large institutions had to compete with a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. (Soros is in it to win it!)  PG&amp;E: yes, many have all been burned on this one! However, strong buying has commenced, and it looks like we are seeing a run up. A president Biden would bail out California and PG&amp;E.  Clang gang: Gonna be a while on this one. Markets are still discounting current prices on future earnings for gold and silver miners. We are going to see a huge increase, but the powers that be are working overtime to keep this down. I am well over 50% return on my GDX, GDXJ, and AG holdings due to CCs. Get paid to wait!  Tanker Gang: You held through the darkest night. Now is when demand may finally recover. We are looking really good on STNG, DHT and EURN. Remember that a supercycle works on a multi-year time horizon. I will bet that STNG hits $12 by early next year just because their CEO is a madlad who probably doesn’t want his options to expire worthless.  Vix: UVXY is cheap, buy shares and sell CCs in the event that a correction takes a bite out of your meme stocks!!!  Gay Bear Gang: FAANGT stocks were the market leaders through the Covid recovery. It has been a while since these stocks hit their high and it looks like they are stumbling. These are early signs of a faltering bull market.

The methodologies employed by the ""market wizards"" cover the entire spectrum from purely technical to purely fundamental—and everything in between. The length of time they typically hold a trade ranges from minutes to years. Although the styles of the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident:   1. All those interviewed had a driving desire to become successful traders—in many cases, overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal.   2. All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably, they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money.   3. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned.   4. The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy.   5. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those interviewed.   6. In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait for the right trading opportunity to present itself.   7. The importance of acting independent of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point.   8. All the top traders understand that losing is part of the game.   9. They all love what they are doing.  TLDR: [The Market Wizards](http://optionboost.com/Market_Wizards.pdf) is a great read.

Power move or dumbass move selling consoles in store on black Friday? I think the only retailer to physically sell next gen consoles in store. Also, I think they're only selling bundles in store, driving up their margins/rev per console sold initially. Smart move as every gaming website/blog is talking about GameStop instead of Amazon/Best Buy because of this - but in terms of optics not sure how people will take it with the pandemic getting worse. Im sure there will be pictures of lines on social media today.  Anyone have any calculations on estimated FCF and gross on the next gen console life cycle for GME?  PS4/XBONE sold \~ 115m and 50m respectively according to wikipedia over their cycle. If PS5/XBX sell 10-20% more units this cycle, that's around 20-35m units for Gamestop over the next few years ( plus bundles / attachments / trade ins / financing / etc ).  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kvhsawwd7yy51.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046e00a0fdfa506c59f944efe4498820698f6b0b  Short term, Sony said they expect to sell 7.6m PS5s by March 2021, so at least 1-2m can be expected to be sold by GME in the next 3-4 months. Not sure about Xbox estimates. \~49% of games sold are still physical, with the total gamer base increasing, the effect on decreasing physical sales isn't as dramatic. Further, parents/grandparents and others who buy games as gifts/presents (big driver of gaming sales) prefer to buy physical gifts.  I'm definitely over-simplifying here (console sales numbers are global, bulk of GME sales are in the US so the % share of sales will be lower than above), but the premise still stands and I think they have a great opportunity to turn profitable by the end of the year.  Oh and this is totally ignoring Switch sales, and all the other things that GME sells, including PC hardware and components. I don't believe the prophetic short squeeze will happen, but I do think the stock will moon soon based on the business itself once the company shakes off its 'in financial distress' reputation amongst investors.  Now that the bankruptcy thesis is pretty much dead in the water with management voluntarily retiring 60% of their debt using cash flow from operations, what will the next big catalyst will be? Clearly this is a huge signal to the market that the business is healthy, and management is bullish on FCF and sales targets for the next few quarters/years.

If you’ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO 🚀, or you were simply 🌈 🐻, then I have the play the next stock to fawn over.  **What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**  Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company’s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald’s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).  This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.   **So what? Why should I care?**  Listen you retard. When there’s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don’t stop and ask, “Man, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?” Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.  Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.  Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.  For you retards who can’t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buy at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for “donations”. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.  The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR’s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.  Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.  This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with 🌈 🐻 LED lights around the case? Those 🤡 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.  In the most recent filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.  **Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**  Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, “PS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?”. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can’t afford them.   CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.  CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories.   **But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait will it drops?**  The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech’s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.  Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)  - Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.  - Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.  - People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.  They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. CRSR’s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)  Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)  If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff).   This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.  **Risks**  F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.  **Price Target**  $40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock. Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock’s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered “Stay at Home” stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1589291|public|confidence|self|||[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtbqwt/crsr_corsair_40c_may_21_2021_exp/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

That's what you call execution *chef kiss*.  Yes, this is only the beginning. The console cycle begins has just begun and GameStop is the largest retailer of games and consoles in the world, with over **5,000** stores worldwide in 10 countries. This cycle will lasts (at least 5) years, as all have previously. GME's pivot to e-commerce combined with an entry into the gaming equipment market will be the defining edge for GameStop.  GameStop. The only place you *know* will have whatever gaming-related item you want - with same day delivery in many locations. This is where GameStop is headed.   Most of you will already have heard the news from GameStop regarding ""Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes"". For anyone that's unsure, this means that they are repaying debts equivalent to $125mn *voluntarily*; as in they are not *required* to pay them back right now.   We already knew that GameStop reported $700mn+ in cash so this reaffirms that GameStop are able to use the cash for deleveraging as opposed to them being *in a tight spot for cash*, so to speak, during the pandemic. This is great news for a brick-and-mortar store (since half of Reddit wants to keep calling it that) considering the sheer number of funds that are about to flow through GameStop (as they have been on pre-orders and will continue for YEARS). I'm no longer concerned about the next earnings as the cost-cutting by Management has been ridiculous. GameStop WILL beat ER expectations.  The news of a vaccine does not negatively impact GameStop or GME stock, in my opinion. People aren't going to game any less than they were before lockdowns, simply because lockdowns are (allegedly) going to go away soon. Before covid was a thing, the gaming industry was continuing to explode as it as has been year on year. It's not gonna slow down any time soon. Not now. Not when Sony and Microsoft just blessed us the next generation of gaming consoles.  Also, short interest is down this time around but only by around 2 million shares. We still have about 68 million shares short. Any more big news and we'll be off 🚀🌚.  To recap:   -Burry/Cohen still **in** - u/DeepFuckingValue still *IN* (big respects for 💎 hands) -institutions increasing their stakes in GME -short interest still over 100% (insane, in itself) -new console cycle JUST started and it's going to last YEARS (GameStop bout to make bank and keep making bank) -debts have been reduced by $125mn -costs being reassessed and cut down regularly -MSFT deal -yada yada yada  **TL;DR** If you thing GameStop is going bust, idk for you fam. Quit while (you think) you're ahead. It may squeeze, it may not. But if you don't think it's gonna moon, think again.  I wonder I many times I said GameStop in this post.

Some of you retards are probably having wet dreams thinking about the short squeeze but let me tell you why it won't happen.  Check out  [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts) , clear your cookies if you want to re-visit the page. Ever since the peak at $15 there's been a huge amount of short selling happening, this combined with the low volume and bad liquidity means shorts can drive the prices down with very little selling and they're able to cover back at low prices to turn a good profit. This all appears to be pretty well coordinated and at times when the cost to borrow becomes high like in October, they are forced to cover but then just restart the short attack again when liquidity dries up and the cost to borrow becomes lower. The cost to borrow has gone from 37% to now just 13.72%  and appears to be trending down further.  I'm willing to venture a guess and say there's probably some hedge fund asshole driving the price down on naked short selling, which could at least partly explain the &gt;100% short % of float .  I'm very bullish on GME and I have 900 shares, selling covered calls close to the money at &gt;100% to you retards weekly.

I'm a little salty that I spent a ton of time researching and typing a full-up DD for CNK last Thursday and Friday.  I got lazy and left early friday, figuring I'd finish today... Now it's irrelevant.  Even you, yeah you, with the smooth brain, can see that CNK is up bigly today.  **But you have not missed the boat yet!**  I dare say the words short squeeze, but hear me out.  I know everyone is sick of hearing it after the GME thing still hasn't panned out, but CNK is 30% shorted, and most of them have gotten in since the BK news from AMC.  **CNK IS NOT AMC**.  Thats I'll I need to say about that.  Back to the numbers:  Short interest has been increasing since the end of April, when there was roughly 11m shorted.  We've now increased to 30M shares short, as of last month.  Using data from marketbea, the average share price shorted at from Apr until now is 12.40--that's completely unweighted for number of shares shorted, just a pure average for a stake in the ground.  More importantly, from 15 September to 15 October, shares shorted went from 23-29 M, at a weighted average of $8.87 per share.  [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNK/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNK/short-interest/)  Cool.  Now lets look at the shareholders.  Institutional investors own 85% of the float, according to CNN money.  **The top 10 institutional owners** and fund managers own 67% of the company (79M shares), or --get this-- **89.3% of the float!**   With 30 M shares (33% of the float) shorted as of last count, this has the potential to really explode.    Pos: long 2k shares.  Had planned on jumping in on some sweet Mar '21 calls, but missed the boat.  Buy shares, ride it up to 20+ and then do what you wish.  CNK will be back to 30+ by EOY 21 as long as the divvy is reinstated.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1583944|public|confidence|self|||BUY CNK! You haven't missed the boat.

I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public.

Pat Roberts (Kansas)**  ***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***  Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.  Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.  Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

Proposition 22 in California will set a precedent for whether or not Uber will be able to continue to operate as it has before, and despite the ridesharing and food delivery industry spending 200 million on ads supporting the measure, it only has a slight lead with many still undecided. As such, I have targeted Uber for a double catalyst play.     I will be buying puts on Uber, but here are reasons why you should, and reasons that you shouldn't:     Reasons NOT to buy puts:   \-Prop 22 passes.   \-Good earnings (date 11/05).  \-Market starts to recover election week.     Reasons that you SHOULD buy puts:   \-Prop 22 fails.   \-Bad earnings.  \-Market continues down.  &amp;#x200B;  First factor: Prop 22 passes or fails. While the race is tight, Prop 22 has a good chance of going either way. There has been a lot of controversy around this proposition, with Uber and others pressuring drivers to vote yes on the measure, spending over 200 million in advertising, and paying several research centers to review the proposition (also contributing 2 million to the California Republican Party). Proponents of the bill believe that drivers want to keep their freedom as independent contractors, with the ability to choose when and where they will work. Drivers will also receive health care and other benefits. However, opponents of the bill point to Uber and other companies' constant rate decreases. They also argue that the health care plan chosen by Uber is one of the most expensive and only applies to those who work over 30 hours a week. Furthermore, allowing Prop 22 to pass would set a precedent for other states and allow companies to reclassify workers as independent contractors, no longer guaranteeing them any health care or unemployment benefits.      I believe Prop 22 will fail for the following reasons: California is a largely Democratic state. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have publicly expressed opposition to the bill, while Republicans support it. Even with all the advertising, the fact that the voting on this proposition is so close means that enough Californians are opposed to it to cause it to fail. It will be very close, however, with all of the money Uber and others have put into the campaign.      Second factor: Earnings     Uber has historically never had ""good"" earnings. It has only lost less than analysts expected, never once going above its IPO price even as driver's cut of their ride fares has consistently decreased, and the number of drivers has increased. I believe that Uber will again fail to turn a profit this quarter, especially with the many lawsuits and the Prop 22 campaign they are now facing.   &amp;#x200B;  Third factor: The overall market  The market downtrending may accelerate any negative news about Uber. COVID cases rising, news of lockdown, a contested election, or Joe Biden winning the election will all cause the market to tank as they try to figure out what they should expect for the next few months.     In terms of the election, there is only one outcome which will cause the market to rise: Trump winning, with a majority Republican senate. However, the other outcomes, such as Biden winning, or either party winning but with a Senate against them, would cause the market to fall.   &amp;#x200B;  Prop 22 failing: 50/50     Bad earnings report: Very likely  Overall market tanking: Very likely  Puts on Uber.      GME update: Still in but have reduced my position a bit to throw some into UBER puts. All the factors I mentioned in my first DD are still in play, but the overall market tank, combined with the price inflating a lot over the past months and lack of new news caused the price to fall a bit. Still way above $4 where we started. The console cycle starting should cause price to rise by January."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1576488|public|confidence|self|||UBER options play|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jlswjs/uber_options_play/|no_ads|0.0||dark||||||||||

I just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I’m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company’s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback)   Back in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD’s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you’re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato PCs. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos.   Anyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That’ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession.   Now here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom’s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.  How does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.  4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times.   Moreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital and   Lastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.  TL;DR  Big push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.  Positions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.  TL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here’s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\_y7Pc?t=938   Gamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren’t going to advertise games for them since they aren’t a gaming retail store primarily.  PS. Bunch of hedge funds trolling GME to scare you out of positions so they can cover their shorts.|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1575894|public|confidence|self|||Gamestop, technical DD on how this gaming cycle will blow the previous highs out of the water.

Did some /r/smallstreetbets to get my feet wet, nothing major. First major (for my tiny ass account at least) play was on AMD, $6000 in to 11/20 90c, when that was starting to get traction on WSB, and naturally they immediately announce a merger with XLNX, which of course fell through at their $30 billion price, and AMD took a nose dive, and I lost $1000 or so. Like the proper autist I am, I decided that the only reasonable play to make back my $1000 was to hop on to the GME bandwagon at $15 ($5000 in to 11/20 17.5c), and appearing to be climbing strong amid their microsoft deal. Of course, last week, covid cases spiked and GME fell to $13.50, absolutely crushing my calls in to a fine powder, leaving them worth about $2000. Finally, I said fuck it, and fuck you GME, and sold my calls in exchange for $2000 in to 11/06 10p on GME, which so far, is literally my first options play that has ever been green.

If you think GME is a meme stock gtfo of this post.  The big boys have an insane amount of short interest and an insane amount of capital and will bend the SP whatever way they want since it's a small cap. Literally half a 1MM of buying will light this thing up $2 a share. If you're retail you need to protect yourself.  (Btw the reason they can't bend it back to $4 is because they're running out of shares to short)   If the stock price goes down to where it was before September they all cover no problem WSB loses no squeeze boo hoo your wife's boyfriend moves in for a month. So it begs the question, how do I keep my tendies when the big boys keep selling? Retail paper hands are gonna fuck on this SP every time there's 300k shares sold short every open.  If you look at the charts, occasionally there are days where the shorts buy back en masse. A huge volume spike with a correlating SP upswing of 15+%. On these days lots of people sell off and shares free up. Now how do you add more pain....  If you've been paying attention the squeeze can only happen if enough SHARES are locked up. You can thank Burry and the HF Boyz for the tiny float available, but the retail player needs to tie up SHARES.   ""But I need my tendies, when I see 15+% green I sell!""  Good point, buy low sell high. But maybe you can do better.  The amount of downward force coming from the hedgies shorting is unreal. They will always depress the price to reduce their borrowing fees and eventually buy back the shares. This is a blessing.   And here's why:  *You can buy OTM puts on days that see 15%+ gains*  By insuring your shares stay valuable after the spike, you pay a premium up front to be *protected* when the big Boyz start shorting again. With the put in place it doesn't matter that the stock is shorted to oblivion because you have locked in your gainz.   ""But what if they don't short more?""   Good question retard. The answer is they will pay interest on a higher stock principle. High stock = more bleed.  If you have puts that are 2 weeks out EXP you can wait for the SP to get manhandled back to $10 and exercise. Lock in the gainz from the put and reset your position at a lower cost basis. Now you got your tendies and you still have the same amount of shares. Rinse and repeat until BofA lets you fuck their wife.  This can literally go tits up IF GME goes bankrupt. Now if you can read any kind of financial statement and have any faith in Cohen Burry etc you'll realize it's tough for most businesses with $4 cash/share to hit Ch. 11. But as long as they have shares on the market, this might work.  This is purely a thought experiment and I am not a financial advisor. Do whatever you want with your life man.

I really hope I'm not breaking any rules but please don't remove this mods❤️  This F/Y I created a relatively diverse portfolio and went from a nice and steady gain of around ~50% since May to about -50% from my initial investment as of tonight. I thought I was making the right calls until I wasn't. No I'm not gonna post loss porn but I've got for letters for you..  H Y L N 😃🔫. Got f'd so hard I can still feel it weeks later. So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I'm a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.  So. GME. If you're still reading...   BULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:  if we consider the company's  -cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat) -sold out pre-orders on the new consoles -brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason) -constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money -change of management  -involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest.. -institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies -GameStop's attempt at pivoting to e-commerce -Microsoft deal -rumoured Sony deal -potential for further deal(s) with more big names -increasing retail interest -retail investors looking for the next success story -premium meme status  I think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports etc, securing further deals).  This valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of catalytic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.   -----   BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE: assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here.   So... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity.    -----   BEAR CASE: the company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why would it suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up to and through the console cycle, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide) GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories.   Additionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?  Also, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.  Also, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as it previous cycles? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium.   Also.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.  Ultimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).   -----   I could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it.  I would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again.   POSITIONS: all in on GME shares cuz I haven't learned a thing from HYLN.

There is nothing but positive news surrounding GME, especially coming into a new console season.   The (20%) pullback that has happened over the last week is honestly a healthy correction for a stock that has been on a bull run of this magnitude (~50%) in the last month. The stock is currently hovering above the 61.8% fibonacci retracement level, which should continue to act as strong resistance and offer a great buying price for a stock that has a lot of short squeezing to come. This stocks success is also backed up by some big names like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen.   I know that this isn’t news to anyone. But I don’t want to hear everyone bitching again when they miss the next run up. But the fucking dip.

Anyone's input who has real experience or knowledge about my retarded questions will be greatly appreciated. Also, I think that a lot of **other tards out there who are stacked with GME calls may want (or need!) some clarity here as well.**    Obviously, I know buy the fucking stock, which I have. However, I do own call options and am wondering if anyone has any experience with how options contracts play out in a short squeeze scenario. I've never played with options in a really stacked short squeeze set up, so I'm wondering how valuable the options will actually be.   My concern is that even **if the stock goes through the roof as the gay bears try to cover their furry loose buttholes, will anyone actually be willing to buy these contracts at an insane price knowing that tomorrow the price may very well be back to where it was the day before?**   * If they won't, then the contract won't really be worth whatever hypothetical price that a normal contract would be in with the same numbers in a different, non short squeeze set up, correct?  * Or am I wrong? Will they be able/willing to buy at astronomical prices and exercise the contract and immediately cover their ass? Would that make sense from a short sellers perspective in this scenario?  * If not, and I'm sitting there watching as the price of the stock goes through the roof but I can't sell my calls at a relative price, **should I then exercise the contract?**   Which leads me to my final question. I've never actually exercised a contract. ***What is the time line between exercising the contract and then being able to sell the shares?*** What's the total turnaround? I can't seem to find a clear answer to that question.   **Any clarity or insight here will be GREATLY appreciated!**   positions: GME: Shares + $10c's &amp; $12c's 1/21/22|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1574626|public|confidence|self|||Question!

I do not know how to access historical short interest data, but anybody who can and is willing to provide that information is welcome to do so.  Notably the last time that we had such a heavy drop (approximately 22%) in GME recently was September 3rd through September 11, and when we look at the the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in that timeframe we see a drop of approximately 3.3%. October 23rd through October 27th we have a drop of approximately 2.15% compared to a drop in GME of 15%. This single stock of a company many expect to fail saw a smaller drop over the last few days relative to the performance of a diverse selection of the market. I panic sold out of my first foray into GME in early September at a significant loss. I am not doing so now despite being up 27%.  Anybody in on the console cycle should be aware of the short interest issue. I haven't any idea just who has the money for this, but based on past data I doubt that they are going to be able to hold out. Change in GME share price from announcement to release was 107% for the PS3, 123% for the PS4, and 40% thus far for the PS5.

No news, squeeze theory is dead, no technical analysis or even fundamental analysis needed, just human psychology. Retails will get paper handed as we get closer to the holidays, and need to sell for money to buy used PS3s on eBay.  MMS have a lot more resources and time than retail, and if these setups were identical under different market conditions(no rona or election) it may have actually worked out headed into a new console cycle. Unfortunately this has to come up with the perfect storm of market shit. Don’t spout the “GME doesn’t correlate or go down with S&amp;P”. Neither do your sisters panties but they’re dropping no matter what for the Chad hedgie shorting you your FDs. Maybe if you got an announcement of Nintendo and Sony giving identical revenue share agreements, PLUS like 2 more 5% + investors announcing positions, PLUS a board vote recalling shares you’d MAYBE have a shot, PLUS a partnership with an existing E-Commerce outlet to grab gamers in store for Esports events (aka use outlets as gamer gathering hubs partnering with GOG/Steam, not their own e-commerce bullshit).  Don’t regurgitate the fundamentals about a rotating business cycle and new ventures. Somebody have an actual concrete reason for the squeeze the way things stand NOW, without several catalysts to pump the thing 100% in a week? This will be a slow bleed back down to Summer levels.

says the short percentage of float has gone up to a whopping 309.83%. The largest ever in trading history.  **Charts:**  &amp;#x200B;  [Daily SMA on 1 year scale](https://preview.redd.it/358nq1ny1ov51.jpg?width=1210&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b17d2e0a67e68e8dc78f346edfe9263f6a2405a4)  &amp;#x200B;  The charts look good. Every time it hits the 20 Day SMA on the daily chart (little blue line), it seems to have liftoff, confirming this is likely the new bottom here. Good time to enter a long position today.   &amp;#x200B;  **Potential Catalysts:**  Share buybacks:  GME has 100 million left out of 300m for 2020 share buybacks to commence. This is the last time they did buybacks. I think we are due for one soon.   Console Cycle: As we know, the new consoles are out in November. Previous historical charts for console release dates confirm that this business cycle is cyclical. As the other users mentioned, highs as much as 60 have been achieved before the buybacks. 100+ adjusted for today's shares outstanding.  Ryan Cohen: Blah blah, chewy guy took a stake. Activist investor may be looking to become CEO.  Microsoft Partnership: 10% profit sharing deal on online purchases made within any console they bring into the system. Seems like free money to me.  Sony Partnership: Probably something will be announced in the future, with GME historically having a better relationship with sony in the past.  Michael Burry: Took a stake. always picks winners  Senvest: Took a stake.   &amp;#x200B;  **Previous Console Cycle Chart:**  &amp;#x200B;  [Console cycle chart](https://preview.redd.it/rm62wtth3ov51.jpg?width=1069&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09eb68ca57da8e80d7ae3efe3ecd88b2bb7ffbd5)  &amp;#x200B;  **Previous Squeezes:**  How Martin Shkreli forced a 10,000 % squeeze on KBIO.

It took him two years to get wrecked on his shorts.   GME will crush all of the hedge fund shorts if it shows real turnaround potential this holiday season. We retards collectively have that potential within us to make it happen. Or at least your mommy does when you ask her to take you to GameStop to do your Christmas shopping.   So before she also takes you through the drive through at Amazon, Best Buy, or Arby’s, check to see if it’s on the menu at GameStop.   Sure the UI blows, the product is more expensive, and it will probably arrive after Christmas even if you order it today.... but you’re not buying at GameStop because you enjoy GameStop.  You’re buying at GameStop to ensure that some hedge fund douchebags have to cover at $85/share.   And also because you want GameStop to be around in 15 years for when your kids need to trade in their week old $80 digital games for 3 cents on the dollar of Xbox live credits.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1571242|public|confidence|self|||If you aren’t buying from GME, it won’t go up...|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jitm25/if_you_arent_buying_from_gme_it_wont_go_up/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

You can apply the theory in your own trading strategies.  Tabaco.   A [study](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~sternfin/mkacperc/public_html/sin.pdf) published in the Journal of Financial Economics found that that “Sin” stocks beat the market by \~2% a year. This has continued for decades, through recessions and bull runs. The primary reason is that many large institutions – Hedge Funds and Pensions Funds - will look bad if they profit off of unacceptable funding sources.   With all of the energy around the green movement, oil is quickly joining the list. If you wait for the bottom, there is a good chance that you can pick up companies that will produce excess returns for decades (Tanker Gang!)  Sell Puts   The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) released a [white paper](http://www.cboe.com/micro/buywrite/bondarenko-oleg-putwrite-putw-2019.pdf) suggesting that writing puts will out perform the S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted Basis:   “Long-term performance. Over more than 32-year period, the PUT index outperformed the traditional indices on a risk-adjusted basis. Compared to S&amp;P 500, PUT has a comparable annual compound return (9.54% versus 9.80%), but a substantially lower standard deviation (9.95% versus 14.93%).”  Theta Gang  Basically, if you already accumulated 100 shares of stock, you can sell covered calls. If you get assigned, you can sell cash secured puts. Make sure you keep your cost basis in mind so you don’t get blown out by a whipsaw market.

Let's take a look at the numbers and what they mean:  [The CMBS delinquency rate](https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbs-delinquency-rate-continues-retreat-from-near-all-time-high) was 9.02% in August. And many of the loans went to the reserves to bring them to current. A large swath of loans that would otherwise be delinquent or in forbearance are above water for ONE reason only, COVID relief. Without structural relief we would currently be seeing a higher delinquency rate.  What is arguably even worse, is that the percentage of loans that were in delinquency for &gt;90days rose 1.5x, from 2.65% in July to 4.02% in August.  According to analysts in the CMBS market, they expect a decrease in delinquencies going forward. Yea they have zero stake in this game and aren't biased towards guiding sentiment towards a favorable outlook on CMBS. The delinquency rate in September was 8.92% inbound December. This decrease they see from August-September was .1%, we aren't seeing a drastic decrease in CMBS because, despite what these analysts say, the overwhelming sentiment is that the delinquency rate will increase, drastically.  Long term? The CRE market is going to crash soon. $31.2B covering 800B loans are now [in forbearance.](https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/monthly-snapshot-cre-cmbs-clo-lending-market-updates-september-2020)  Let's talk about sentiment? Everyone in corporate America is working from home. Including myself. Guess what COVID told all of c-suite across the world? You DO NOT need office space anymore. Is WFH permanent? No, people will go back to the office. But every single one of the companies in the F500 and SP500 are reassessing their CRE needs to save on costs. Every single one of these companies now realizes their business model can largely be done outside of massive office space, and downsizing is imminent. Outside of office space, guess how many people want to spend money on hotels right now? Almost none. And with a second wave coming, we are going to see a ton of casualties.  We're seeing 2008-2011 levels for CMBS delinquency and overall performance. This time instead of residential real estate taking the brunt of the crash, this will be CRE.  Puts on any index/etf that is invested in CRE. I kept this DD sorta short just to display the basic sentiment and raw numbers that highlight why this industry is in trouble.

On Friday, NOK made a very subtle, and very quite close. During this close it crossed. While others are talking about the earnings reports of big tech this week, NOK is hiding in the shadows waiting for that Thursday release. By the time you second guess my DD on Tuesday of this week, it will already be too late. Wednesday we will be over $4.50 and Thursday at open we will cross $4.85. TA nerds love crosses. You know who else loves crosses?

I'm more interested in feedback.   My first year of trading, I did not buy or sell anything. No stocks no options. I organized a watchlist of companies I loved and followed religiously while saving ~$400. Then OSTK happened.  Patrick Byrne, then CEO of overstock.com, sold a ton of his own assets and consequently tanked OSTK share price. Yadayadayada fuck it. It dipped, I made my first move, I made money on the correction yadadada and then shit got weird. Like, CEO dumping his own company, Russian spy scandal, SEC stopping trading for the day!, short squeeze, class action lawsuit weird. (Newbies, look it up)  But with my hymen busted and a fresh, bewildered look at the dirty dirty beautiful world of finance I learned what a short squeeze is.   GME is a short squeeze that hasn't happened yet. DD in the paragraph after next.  ... Some of you trade options successfully and long term. I'm struggling with the books and YouTube videos I have in regard to options trading. I can tell you I need help. I average 70% overall and 186% YTD with stocks. But it's not enough and I need help with options. It's not a secret that this sub has turned to new traders (God bless them).   GME is a short squeeze that hasn't happened yet. A short squeeze is when a stock rockets up. It's like cranking the throttle on a new bike or pinning the pedal on your Alfa Romeo (DM me if you have a Ferrari). A short squeeze is when you look at your charts and can't make sense of how much money you've made.  🙄 A short squeeze is when a stock sells so much that the price goes up. Shares sold short (on margin) get pressure from the broker to be pushed up. For instance, GME had 89% short interest a month ago. Now it's OVER 100% short interest. To be honest, I didn't know this was possible before the beer virus but hey- anything goes right? One more time, I'll try to explain:  There are about 65 million shares of GameStop. 68 million are sold short right now. The price has been going up. Big investors have come in. Sony and Microsoft have cut deals with GameStop.  ....  fuck it. I'm tired. As your wife's boyfriend, I want to tell you very much that I love you and I wish the best. Go bull on GME. *kiss on cheek.

Only later did I realize that Frodo – A HOBBIT – was the only one who could take the Ring to Mount Doom.*   *#Palantir*  *Competition is for losers (don’t be a loser)*  One of the main headlines that came from this book is that competition is for losers. If you want that cute girl, you better be willing to compete to get into the right high school, the right college, the right internships, the right entry level jobs, etc….ALL TO WASTE YOUR LIFE MAKING SOMEONE ELSE RICH.  When everyone around you is competing, then it is logical to work harder and harder.   But, if the only way to move up is working harder, how do you build a better life?  *Build a monopoly (#Roll-the-dice,-it's-paradise.-But-if-you-fail,-you-go-to-jail)*  A monopoly can be the government stepping in and limiting competition, or one company cornering the market. However, the monopoly we are interested in, is anything that is 10X better than the next best option. *If you were 10X better than every other man (aka a chad), your wife wouldn’t need Alexandro, her boyfriend.*   Once you have a service, or a product, that is 10X better, there is no reason for consumers to buy anything else. You can crank up the margins and enjoy a solid standard of living with a reasonable work schedule *#1950s.*   *Globalization vs Innovation*   An untold amount of ink has been spilt on this topic, so I encourage you to go to the source. Suffice it to say, Globalization is where you make money from bringing a good idea to noobs, whereas Innovation is when you create something new. Both are very profitable strategies, but Globalization requires endless competition while Innovation creates monopolies.  *Evaluating the monopolies of today*  Think Facebook (Facebook), Apple (iPhone), Amazon (government contractor in disguise), Tesla (10X better car), and GameStop (only way to buy funko pops and PS4 in the same trip)  We can expect these companies to continue to make mad money until the paradigm shifts. Ask yourself, when are people going to stop using phones, disparaging friends online, or buying funko pops at GME? That means these companies are a safe bet. Not only will they be around in 10 years, but they have a good chance of being even more entrenched and making even more money.

Basically, all of society is trying to take your time, energy, and resources (referred to as “tendies” moving forward). Instead of allowing others to reallocate your tendies to different goals, everyone should grab the gay bull by the horns and take control of their financial future.   *Do not go gentle into that good night,*   *Old age should burn and rave at close of day*  If you allow it, society will eat your tendies until you are 75. The GOP, the Democrats, and the guy who skims fees for “managing” your index fund, all have an endless number of ways to distract you from accomplishing your life goals. When you are 75, you won’t care who the president was 47 years ago, but you will probably wish that you had saved more GME for a rainy day.  *Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright*    *Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,*  Don’t let your memes be dreams. A lot of people lurk here on r/WallStreetBets. I encourage you to take life into your own diamond hands and start investing in meme stocks. If you are worried you will lose your money, then cut out some spending (do you even enjoy those soy lattes?) and start buying safe investments like SPY or GME. If you do lose it all, then at least you lost it in pursuit of tendies.  *Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight*    *Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,*  It is not too late, even for boomers, to start selling covered calls on all the GME stock you have amassed. The big thing here, is that society encourages the average investor to be passive and cut a check to their money manager who does next to nothing. The end goal is not to have your money making more money. The end goal is freedom.  *And you, my father, there on the sad height,*    *Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.*    *Do not go gentle into that good night.*    *Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*  My grandfather, like so many Americans before him, and so many more to come, served his country, worked hard, paid taxes, and trusted that the system would take care of him. It didn’t. He had to work until his body gave out.   He said something that continues to haunt me, “I don’t know how you make so much money. I was never able to do anything like that. Some people are like that, everything they touch makes money.” It is sad because he worked so hard his whole life, when a little more knowledge would have given him 20 years back with the people he loved.  Anyone can learn how to beat the market. If you passively hope an index fund will save you, then you are going to wake up at 65 and realize that fees and inflation compound too. Taxes are going to be higher, and Social Security is a wet dream. Don’t spend the best years of your life working to make other people rich.

This is for anyone who cannot find their way to tendie town.  [Required Reading-Chads Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk&amp;ab_channel=LucasBean)   For the half of you that were offended by that speech, I hear they are giving away free tampons at r/Investing where you can buy and hold SPY for the next 50 years.   For the other 50% who belong on r/WallStreetBets, the message is clear: if you can’t make money in the market, you have only yourself to blame.   *Coffee is for closers (embrace your loss porn)*  The Closing of the American Mind shows that 18 y/o kids in college know next to nothing and were given participation trophies their whole lives. Does this sound like the stereotypes you hear about millennials? Well, this book was written in 1987. For 50 years, Americans were told that their point of view was valid, and that they were worthy of attention. Very few people are equipped to put their ego aside and realize that they don’t know nearly as much about the world as they thought. The market doesn’t care about your opinion on global warming, your color, your degree, or your politics. if you’re *“a good father.” Good, then go home and play with your kids.*  When it comes to the market, all that counts is being right. If you have major loss porn, embrace this as the most real feedback you have ever gotten. For your whole life, you had an imperfect understanding of reality and everyone around you – your parents, friends, and teachers - were too nice (or didn’t care enough) to correct you. This is an opportunity to learn about where you went wrong and how another trader might have played the situation differently.  *First place prize is a Cadillac, the 2nd place prize… steak knives (yolo)*  A lot of famous investors, got their money from relatively few bets. It may be bitcoin, over-leveraged GME options, or Tesla calls, but the #1 way to get truly rich is to find a niche that is not on the radar and bet (relatively) big.  To all the newbies: always play with money you can afford to lose and if you have a position that goes 100X, you don’t need your whole portfolio in that play. 10% is plenty. If it does not work out, at least you saved money bc you didn’t need #rope.  *Always Be Closing (the golden rule)*  Always be closing your positions. If you have a position that is up 50%, sell half. That money is laying on the ground. If you wont pick it up, the market will have no sympathy for you. Novice traders try to time the top. Chad traders are constantly taking profits.

This is a story of how the autists at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) built an empire and pioneered the path that 99% of WallStreetBets traders are destined to follow. Learn from the OGs or suffer their fate.  **The DD**  LTCM was founded on a truly genius DD: Back before every money manager had 15 PhD nerds on staff, trading securities [was for retards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6exo00T5I&amp;ab_channel=OGF). The autists at LTCM realized that a US treasury today was worth more than a US treasury delivered next month. The difference between these prices could be captured by shorting (borrowing) the treasury in hand and buying the future treasury.  This made next to nothing, but also carried no risk since the price of the shorted treasury and the future treasury would eventually converge. Can’t go tits up.   **The DD Goes Autistic**  The truly autistic part of their plan was to multiply the trade with infinite leverage. This was possible because shorting the treasury in hand always produced more money than it cost to buy a future treasury. They also convinced (gay) Bear Stearns to forgo the “haircut” they normally took for fulfilling trades (Robinhood enters the chat).   **To The Moon**  Eventually, LTCM (150 employees) leveraged to infinity and beyond. A firm worth $4.7 billion ended up borrowing $1,000,000,000,000, back when $1,000,000,000,000 was a lot of money (roughly the GDP of China). While margins were small, the leverage allowed them to make (a yolo) 27% zero-risk gains. The tendie train had arrived.  **It Goes Tits Up**   On August 17th, 1998, the Russian government decided it made more sense to feed hungry Russians than pay Western bond holders. This default sent shockwaves through the bond market and LTCM were hemorrhaging 6% to 10% a month. Bonds were seen as the fortress of the investment world, but buyers were now skittish about any asset that required a counterparty. LTCM experienced a margin call.  **Diamond Hands**  The portfolio continued to fall every week. No buyers were found. Eventually, none other than Warren Buffet (that ruthless capitalist) stepped in to buy the LTCM portfolio for $250 million, which meant a stunning 94.68% loss for LTCM. Rather than brag about their loss porn on Reddit, LTCM did what anyone on WallStreetBets would do: collapse the global financial system.  **Money Printer Go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR**    As it turns out, $1 trillion in losses was enough to bring down every bank in the United States. Rather than allow these oligarchs to learn a lesson, the Fed (JPOW enters the chat) orchestrated a forced bailout to save LTCM and changed financial rules to allow the firm to recover and disband.   **What We Learned**  Sitting in that room with JPOW (1998 edition) and LTCM were: Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Chase, Bear Sterns, etc. It was a who’s who of the 2008 Great Financial Crises. Every banker learned that you can make massive, retarded bets for short term gain and the government will step in to clean up your mess.   **TLDR (The Moral of This Story):** Market Makers never lose. You are playing a rigged game and even if you win, the government will step in and make sure the big dogs eat your tendies.  *Positions:* *Irresponsible, all-in leverage on GME*|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1563236|public|confidence|self|||When Genius Failed (how to never lose)|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jf34ih/when_genius_failed_how_to_never_lose/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'kpvJKwt4GjNcIH7apMPoQODJk2TAWn9uXYyBY_iHwbc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uyjTF_iFul_BLOFlMBfyQWqfhOlfcU2C9ivZO53RR54.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=489b9004421080181080f037cb960018d0eb9f63', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uyjTF_iFul_BLOFlMBfyQWqfhOlfcU2C9ivZO53RR54.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1333e735ab79b8e2e4576bcede6d6fa2ebbbc494', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uyjTF_iFul_BLOFlMBfyQWqfhOlfcU2C9ivZO53RR54.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7875989c5446d8767a6f16891b83b9bf81275552', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uyjTF_iFul_BLOFlMBfyQWqfhOlfcU2C9ivZO53RR54.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e4a460bb2dccca2eaa45de7291f602d5e3fe3959', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||

What is Cerence you might be asking as your eyes have not been able to see anything but $GME or $AMD for the past few weeks because you are all degenerate fucktards who are alive for the sole purpose of losing money.   Cerence are the market leaders in AI and voice technology which is utilised within Automobile industry. They have been established and operating for more than 20+ years and their technology is currently used in 325M+ Cars already. They are partners with some of the biggest automobiles companies such as BMW, JAGUAR, FORD, GMC ETC.    Cerence have recently teamed up with NIO on voice recognition and I envisage this trend unfolding against ALL EV manufacturers to provide the smart and next generation Technology for safety and Entertainment purposes.   This is just the tip of the iceberg, they have recently began to venture in to Non-Automobile industries and have landed some big fucking contracts.   The company is already performing very well and within the coming months and years they will be the market leaders in AI technology with their stock price estimated to match and then grow larger than the biggest competitors (NVDA, TSLA)   This is a potential 10 bagger and in the coming months and years this is going to be astronomical. This right here would be stock which gives you an early retirement so you no longer have to sleep in your wife’s boyfriends basement every night.

I'll tell you how they do it based on past posts so that you can recognize when you're being hoodwinked.  **Mods:** I'm very sorry if some shithead tries to use this as a how-to manual. I think it's more useful for the community as a whole to learn how they might be getting duped.  # Why?  They do this shit because they can make a lot of money. They recommend some cheap, low volume, and way OTM contract and multiply it's value in a couple of hours. Here's a couple of pump and dumps from the last year and estimated returns the pumpers made on those contracts. And while these returns look fabulous **remember that the pumpers' gain is almost certainly your loss**.   [LL: Lumber Liquidators](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6tthu/lumber_liquidators_ll_a_massive_turnaround_play/)  Over 600%  [MIK: Michael's](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bdj3/michaels_mik_has_huge_turnaround_potential_they/) Over 200% (not sure, wasn't around collecting price data that day)  [ESTC: Elastic N.V.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnwtjt/estc_soon_to_rise_an_unrecognized_beneficiary_of/) \~500%  [DXC: DXC Technology](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv6ko0/big_swinging_dxc_why_a_bad_company_will_run_from/) 200-300%  [SSSS: Suro Capital](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixqqjc/how_to_make_an_easy_100_on_palantirs_ipo_before/) \~300%  There's more than these that I have seen during my time on this sub; these ones are just particularly memorable. A lesser 50% return is still a very successful pump.  # The securities  The pumpers carefully pick the contracts and the underlying to juice returns.  Price: **Pumpers start with very cheap contracts.** Under a dollar for sure. 0.05-0.40 is preferred. This all has to do with the logic of multiplication. The pumper's goal is to blow up a single contract and it is much easier to blast from 0.05 to 0.15 than from 5.00 to 10.00. After all, contract that costs a total of $500 looks expensive to a smooth-brained noob, whereas a bunch of $15 contracts are more appealing as a ""little bet."" Generally, getting this sort of price on the contract requires the underlying to be cheap as well. Pumpers like to target options on stocks with prices in the $5-$50 range to avoid the no pennies rule here while keeping the options cheap.  Open interest: **Pumpers exclusively shill low OI contracts.** Low OI is a certain indicator that the pumper is the market maker. With few other market participants to correctly price the options, you will get taken for a ride when you buy from the pumper. Low OI can mean anywhere from 10s of contracts to a few thousand, depending on the price of the contract (penny contracts sometimes have a few thousand OI simply because they are cheap.  The underlying: **Pumpers use options on stocks with market caps less than $5 billion.** Typically they will be even smaller at less than $500 million. They do this because it is aligned with the above goals of low price and fewer market participants to correctly price the steaming pile that they are shilling.  Expiration and IV: Unless WSB completely moves the market on the underlying, **pumpers make money when the time value shoots up.** **They therefore choose contracts** **that are far OTM with middling IV** (smaller cap stocks almost never have low IV) **and expirations in 2 weeks to 3 months.** They pick the far OTM contracts so that the contract's value is purely from it's time value. They pick the durations so that the contracts are still cheap (not LEAPs), but are sensitive to changes in IV so that the time value (0DTEs are less sensitive) can rocket up. They pick middling IVs so that the IV has room to pump.  # The posts  Like this post, **the pumpers use good formatting**. **Headers, bold fonts, links, pictures, graphs.** They do this because you short-attentioned goldfish won't read more than a paragraph or two, but will believe the whole text uncritically if you can pick out the main points. Granted, good formatting is part of being a good Reddit poster.  **Their logic appeals to smooth-brained novices like yourselves**. Muh short squeeze 🤡 (sorry GME tards). FREE MONEY (the LL $25 million tariff refund, the SSSS stake in PLTR). Some rich dude or hedge fund owns shares. Then they sprinkle in some smart sounding bullshit that they read in the company's latest 10-Q to justify that the company is undervalued and everyone will realize that during the next earnings call. Of course, you won't be reading the 10-Q to actually understand why that might be wrong.  **The posts are usually in the morning.** The pumper gets in their position just after the market opens, drops the post, and now sits back as the option runs up all day. As early retards see their contracts going up, they praise OP as a genius, upvote him, and send more willing morons into the trap. OP closes at the end of the day and the next day the contract implodes.  **They promise sickkk gainnzz.** ""Ten bagger,"" ""Easy 100%+,"" etc. There is no real rhyme or reason why their play should have so much upside, but they assert it, and you take the stinky bait.  **There is a TL;DR at the top (or bottom) that tells you exactly which option contract to buy.** Again, you all are such morons that you don't actually read or critically evaluate the post and you just do what OP tells you to do. *Honestly, you deserve to lose your money.

Maybe I can help someone who is getting started.   Recommendations from the Machine  Finance recommends buy-and-holding the S&amp;P 500 to anyone who is looking to invest their money. As everyone knows, the market has historically returned 9.8% while the average day trader returns -36.3% and quits within 2 years. In fact, if you make more than minimum wage, then you are the top 1% of all day-traders. Congratulations!  Work forever for the Machine  The truth is that while the market compounds at 9.8% a year, inflation compounds as well. Taxes will also increase before you get a chance to enjoy your nest egg at 65. Depending on how you count, this takes your return to as low as 5%/year in real growth. On top of that, these returns are averages gathered over 90 years. If there is a market crash before, or during, your retirement, you will have to return to the work force because your investments will take up to 10 years to recover.  Beat the Machine (if you are poor)  Experts say you can’t beat the market, but ordinary Americans have $5,700 of credit card debt that compounds at \~15%. This means the average American can pay off their credit card, and most forms of debt, and beat the market when considering a risk-adjusted return.   Beat the Machine (by buying lottery tickets)   I know [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets) is all about Yoloing weeklies on Hertz. If you are going to lose your future purchasing power to inflation, taxation, and regulation, then you might as well spend that money on lottery tickets today.  Invest to beat the Machine  The alternative to Yolos and buy/hold is to play the stock market directly. Retail investors actually have some pretty large advantages over large institutions.   1) Look into real estate: if you think buying stocks on margin is good for juicing returns, just know that the US government will let you leverage your money 3,233% if you are buying a home. Keep in mind that unlike the stock market, you gain on your home through appreciation, amortization, tax loopholes, and inflation.  2) Excess capital: Most small investors have jobs. If you already paid off your debt and live below your means, you can accumulate a significant amount of cash reserves that can be used to “buy the dip” during market down turns. Compare this to a hedge fund that must raise capital from new/existing investors if they experience a steep decline.  3) Time horizon: Hedge funds must show an increase in assets every quarter or they risk losing investors who can transfer their assets to another firm. If you are a retail investor, you can hold on to assets for years to get a 500% return (I’m looking at you Tanker Gang!)  4) The kiddie pool: Many institutions are just too big to take meaningful risks in small markets. It doesn’t matter if you are about to ride the short squeeze in GME, if you are HODLing your Bloc Chainz, or if you are knee deep in the GDXJ. A lot of these markets are just too small for the big dogs to enter without massively changing the fundamentals.   Use these retail advantages by building up an emergency/Yolo fund during good times. Be willing to look at assets (10% of your portfolio) that have explosive value but need a catalyst to make those outsized returns (Bloc Chainz, oil tankers, GME, XLE, etc)  Options  Once you build up a significant war chest, you can start playing options. You can *wheel* your capital (sell covered calls till assigned, then sell puts) until you cash flow 2X what you need to live a happy life, then retire. This may be as little as $500,000 if you are frugal, and as much as $1,000,000 if you want that 6-figure life.

It is MASSIVELY shorted. There are roughly [\~70 million shares](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/GME.htm) that have to be bought sooner or later.  There aren't many opportunities like this where a company is turning around, entering a new console super cycle with a healthy balance sheet, gaming and tech visionaries leading the turn around, and negative sentiment prevailing for years. This created one of the greatest short bubbles I've seen in the market. Rumor has it that a few Wall Street firms are on the short end of this trade.  People have already posted about [Ryan Cohen](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9-1029612504), [Reggie Fils-Aime](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/reggie-fils-aime-gamestop/), [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-deal-with-gamestop-includes-revenue-share-on-digital-sales-2020-10)...I'm going to talk a little about Gamestop's E-commerce. E-commerce is very important as it will massively increase its total addressable market and help continue optimizing its dense retail structure (increasing profitability.)  Now that Gamestop is turning into an e-commerce gaming power house (""Chewy of Gaming""), it's good to track their e-commerce metrics. Gamestop's total addressable market went from purely relying on brick-and-mortar to include everyone with internet. Their website is very nice now and they also recently [updated the app](https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1311802247114678273)  . Covid has changed consumer shopping behaviors and forced companies to up their e-commerce games, subsequently putting [consumer loyalty up for grabs](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/building-customer-loyalty-in-the-post-covid-19-retail-environment/) (Gamestop already has [55+ million loyalty members!](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0))  Let's see what their e-commerce has been doing. Referring to the charts below (data excludes the app; it's only web and mobile web traffic):  1. [Gamestop web traffic is skyrocketing](https://www.similarweb.com/website/gamestop.com/)    from August to September. What's really interesting is that its Category Ranking (a measure against its own competitors) went from 83 to 38! This could mean that Gamestop is capturing market share from its e-commerce competitors (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, etc.) 2. Organic search is improving (less ad costs and means people are searching for Gamestop directly) 3. Social media referrals are increasing (Twitter and Reddit leading the way) 4. [Google searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gme%20stock)    for Gamestop's stock are at all time highs! (Bonus...not directly related to Gamestop's e-commerce) 5. Another big one that not many people know about yet is that Gamestop is penetrating PC Gaming Hardware. That is a [$40 billion industry](https://wccftech.com/pc-gaming-hardware-market-to-grow-by-3-6-billion-in-2020-thanks-to-covid-19/)    and growing! The overall industry is growing at roughly 10% a year and entry-level gaming hardware is growing at over 20%! I believe Gamestop has the advantage of being a dominant player in that industry compared to Newegg, Best Buy, Amazon, etc. As a comparison, roughly half of [Best Buy's revenue](http://s2.q4cdn.com/785564492/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/Best-Buy-Fiscal-2020-Annual-Report.pdf) (pg. 26) comes from Computing and Mobile (\~$20 billion.) Gamestop is getting ready to attack that industry hard and get its piece of the pie. This could be a very fast growing and lucrative category!  I've attached a screenshot of interestings graphs and metrics, and you'll find references to articles in the hyperlinks above. Enjoy :)  TL:DR Gamestop e-commerce is killing it.

If we go with a conservative 3bn target with 65m shares outstanding that would be a 46$ price target. 2019 revenue was 6bn already. Now take into the account the bubbly nature of today's account and the fact that Tesla's 2019 revenue was just 4x of Gamestop's (yes, that's right, 24bn vs 6bn) we have a pretty (realistically) optimistic thesis  Now, I would argue that this console cycle could be even better for the company than any of the last two:   * New management trying to turn the company around + Ryan Cohen who turned *dog food company* into a multibillion business * Gaming is going to only increase in popularity * Despite bearish arguments, GameStop actively tries to get into digital. Part of everything a person spends digitally on an xbox sold at GameStop goes to the company. I think that is a huge additional revenue stream. * CDs are declining only in a percentage of total sales compared to digital, but absolute numbers are not decreasing. I saw a data on that somewhere but am too lazy now to search for it so treat it as my personal opinion * (if you like crayons) GME formed two perfect cup&amp;handle patterns: on 1month and 1hr charts * If that was not enough there might be countless wildcard events: Sony sharing digital revenue (not that much of a stretch), any other partnership with major gaming entities, share buybacks (was in the past so not off the table), some new investors, or any of the ideas they come up to let GameStop live and prosper   Now if we speculate that GameStop's market cap would only be 9bn (was one cycle ago) we have a share price of 138$ per share.  The short squeeze is just a cherry on top of that, propelling the price up faster and higher. But we can also play that. The new short interest data comes out on Oct 26th, so we'll have a more clear picture of what is happening on the short side.

This is not going to be your next GME.    If you are looking for VIX strategies, this is not your thread.  This is a straight forward ITM call, which I believe is at a good price to buy in at. I am only in for $505.  https://preview.redd.it/3td7ahcdjdt51.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce66c31f1cbce2811f2c0aef1b470d0b50b981ef  **VXX 21 01 15 C20 @ $5.05 I purchased today near close** (sorry it's not an impressive amount, if you check the actual VIX options instead, you'll find the bigger players). They may be less tomorrow morning, or they may not be, but I think it's important to make a decision quickly in case tomorrow   VXX is currently at 22.15 as I type this, after closing on a steady decline today, while stocks tried lazily and slowly to consider a rally back from off-hour declines.   This call needs a gain of about 11 1/2% to break even at that price. That's not little, and unless there is an actual crash, this will not likely make you triple your money by Reindeer season, but I believe it's still a solid play for solid gains, \*\*\*\***as long as you realize that selling window when you profit is crucially important\*\*\*\***. You don't have to time the event that causes the spike, but you will have to be ready to sell for profit almost immediately when something warrants it, so set your alerts up. **Missing an event, which is your opportunity to sell for profit, is not part of the plan**. You have to be ready to sell via your mobile device, and have a profit taking limit set that you can live with, in the event that you are busy doing something less important than staring at VIX futures and trying to compute how the hell it translates to the VXX correlation. If you need instructions on how to set a limit, or use a broker that does not do GTC for whatever reason, this may not be for you.  **Here's the bet:**   **Almost any important macro event of uncertainty** **before January** **will have the potential to create an opportunity** **to take a realistic profit** **due to general nervousness,** and the likelyhood of any random selloff causing a brief, but large enough spike, to allow you to cash in on VXX, as long as you get in while it's not overly expensive. It's not as fancy of a play as VIX, but it also handles very differently, and is easier to deal with for small traders. **Because A Cash Covered VXX Call can be excercised at any time, unlike VIX futures which can also add spread costs and are more complex in nature,** a VXX call gives you the opportunity to take profit at any given spike. My belief is that 25% will be the minimum gain if you get in at a good price. I'm not knocking VIX, this just happens to be more accessible for small accounts, and much less complicated.  **Your enemy is time**, **but** giving your call a date of January 15th means you hit a number of chances for a large move due to general nervousness. Remember, your seller is betting that you will not exercise your call, or sell to someone who will, at all. That's their primary goal. This is not a buy and hold until expiration strategy by any means. The reason for the duration is because it will give a large window of time without pushing your break even into something that is purely FD territory.  **You have in this time frame**:  **An election**,   a **supreme court justice nominee**,   **fear of the recent market adjustments** becoming more regular,   **uncertainty as to where to move money** when market corrections happen,  but also too **many holidays** to mention (this part is **very important**),   and an almost certain continuation of **worry about COVID 2.0** because holidays could very well increase infection rates massively.  And yes, everyone has already considered playing or hedging with volatility through the election cycle, and VIX options are priced accordingly, but 2020 is not a normal year, and VXX is not VIX.

I'm a degenerate options gambler, not a fucking clue what I’m doing. I obviously don't win 95% of my trades trades but I still dive in on weeklies every Monday hoping for those short squeeze tendies.

GME puts- long term, cause blockbuster.   &amp;#x200B;  I was getting ready to blow my load on some GME calls this morning at market open, because you turds had me sold.  \-Short Squeeze   \-Epic Microsoft Deal   \-Turn Around King CEO  But, I thought to my self... did BlockBuster, ever turn it around? They laughed in the face of change, what makes you Daivey1, think that GME is different? You know, people don't change, why would companies?   So, I decided to pull up the 10-Q and take a look at the Q2 report (August 3rd, if anyone even read it.) LOL, if anyone looked at their 10-Q, I love how their management team tried to hide the fact that their **sales were DOWN 26.7% from same quarter last year.**   At the top of their 10-Q, they parade the fact that their eCommerce was up 800% and, costs were down biggly, BUT, of course, the important news -SALES- that part does not get nice Big Burly Bold Font... Nope, that gets the usual size 12, Arial font, to help it blend in with the rest of the shit 10-Q.  As I am perusing this fine specimen of a 10-Q, I take a look at the sales mix.   **Last year in august, for 26 week ended GME sold $1.2 billion in consoles and $1.3 billion in software.**  **This year in august, for 25 week ended GME sold $955 million in consoles and $803 million in software.**  Oh, shit, their sob story goes on about how ""well 2020, is the end of the console cycle, blah blah blah"".  How, the fuck, during COVID, do your software sales go DOWN. I will give them a BREAK on console sales (*EVEN though, back in March-April-May-June-July, YOU Couldn't find a used X-box, Nintendo, PS to save your life, and GameStop had new consoles in stock!).*  Like legit, every software sales company in the world has GONE UP during covid ""stay home stocks"".  ***But, but, but, but, THE MICROSOFT DEAL is a FREE LUNCH!***  That's a good joke. I thought about it for a while. Someone in another thread posted about how Microsoft will pay them $1.50 commission on GamePass sold per month, and it equates to something like $180 million in easy profit over the next few years...  Umm, do you yall realize that in order to earn a commission, you need to sell something first, right? How does GME plan to do that, when they can't even sell one of the hottest commodities during COVID?   And even if the Microsoft deal is as lucrative as thought and they keep chugging at their CURRENT sales volume, the Microsoft deal doesn't even cover the difference between the lost sales between 2020 and 2019.....   But Ok, the 2nd Q is during the summer... Not notorious for video gaming. It's X-Mas that counts, Right?   Think about this, if summer sales were 26% higher LAST YEAR, wtf is Christmas going to look like this year? Specially if that Stimulus doesn't pass and with unemployment edging higher?   The incentive to buy from GME, when Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart offer the same product and likely more trusted from an adult perspective....   but hey... this is WSB.

These past few days, we've had very few stonks available to short, so short rate was really high.  **So here are some observations:**  * **9/15 to 9/18**, GME short rate spiked from around 30% to 60%. And correspondingly its price mooned from about $6.86 to $9.20. **A moon of 35%.** * From **4/10 to 4/30**, GME short rate went from around 38% to an insane 190%. And in this time, GME went from 3.60 to 5.87. It **blew up 63%**.  So the point is our short rate as of recent is resembling one of those above events. The short squeeze is upon us!  &amp;#x200B;  **The play:**  \- A whole lotta stonks   \- Nov 13-15 area calls and Jan 13-20 area calls.  &amp;#x200B;  This can shape to become an easy 10 bagger if not much much more. Tendie season is here boys.

When the news first launched, there was much debate about whether it was just a cut of initial sales or continued revenue sharing. As it turns out, DOMO Capital has confirmed that GameStop will be getting a cut of ALL downstream revenue related to systems they sell.  \-GameStop will share revenue of all digital content: DLC, full-game downloads, microtransactions, XBOX game pass, movies, etc.  \-Applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the Xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GS, they would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold  \-Incentivizes GameStop to push XBOX. What does this mean? If talks are not already underway, expect Sony and Nintendo to reach similar agreements so that Microsoft doesn't get preferential treatment. They certainly don't want to miss out with GameStop being the largest reseller of systems  &amp;#x200B;  Does anyone really think GameStop is going to turn around? No, not likely.

I took a little hiatus due to finding out my wife is pregnant. I'm very happy for her and her boyfriend and can't wait to raise the child as my own! Anyways, episode 2 was all about the vertical spread and if you haven't read it yet you can find it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ijo98s/options_101_episode_2_leveling_up_to_the_vertical/) I will be referring to the Greeks a lot in this post, if you don't know about options Greeks, read [episode 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iewqhw/options_101_episode_1_an_introduction_to_the/) and you'll understand more of those weird, confusing words I'll be referring to later.  Topics I'm going to cover include: - What Is A PMCC? - How To Select Your Long Call - Where To Sell My Short? - What If The Underlying Blows Past My Short? - How To Roll Your Short Call Effectively  There will be no TLDR. If you can't read you don't deserve tendies. Class is in session.  # What Is A PMCC?  PMCC stands for Poor Mans Covered Call. It could also be considered a diagonal spread or a calendar spread, but for the purpose of this post we are going to focus on PMCC.  You set up a PMCC by going long a call option and selling a call option using your long as collateral. This way, you don't have to own 100 shares and can earn some of that sweet, sweet premium at a fraction of the cost while still reaping the rewards of option buying degeneracy.  Keep in mind that your short option must be **closer** to expiration than you long option, and the strike is **greater or equal** to the strike of your long.  Lets say stock XYZ is trending at $53. An example would be going long XYZ 50c 1/15/21 and selling XYZ 55c 10/16/20. The idea is that you sell calls for as long as you want to hold on to the long in order to make passive income and lower your cost bases.  A PMCC has a unique Greek profile; it's a positive Delta, positive Vega, and positive Theta play. This means that you gain value as the price moves up, you gain value as IV increases (and lose it when it decreases), and Theta decay is in your favor. You will also be selling Gamma, but this can be neutralized by good rolling technique.  # How To Select Your Long Call  If you're not interested in setting up a PMCC in order to collect premium and would rather just buy vanilla calls and make a little premium on them to lower your cost basis, skip to the next section.  The two components in this are 1) stock selection 2) expiration/strike and 3) leverage. A lot of this will come down to personal preference, but there are a few things to keep in mind when entering this position. For the purpose of this section, I will be defining RISK as the chance that the play will no longer be profitable by selling options.  1) Stock Selection  Although a PMCC requires you to sell a call, this is a bullish play, so keep that in mind. For beginners who just want to get their feet wet this is probably the easiest part as you can simply just choose a stock you like that's in your price range. Keep in mind that the main risk of this strategy is when the underlying shoots below the strike of your long call, so don't be retarded and blow your load on GME or NKLA.  If you want to maximize your edge and take advantage of the positive Vega, you can select tickers with low IV Rank and IV Percentile. **Side note: I was going to make a post about IV Rank/Percentile first, but didn't think it was necessary to learn about that for the purpose of PMCC. My next post will be about this topic**  2) Expiration/Strike  There are a few rules of thumb when choosing where to purchase your call. The longer out you select your expiration, the less theta burn you have over time and the cheaper the option is to own per week through the life of the option (this is calculated by dividing the number of weeks until expiration by the price of the option). Basically, the farther out you buy your call, the more efficient it will be for generating income over the life of the call. Think of choosing the expiration as choosing how efficient you want your play to be.  Strike price is a lot more important IMO and it's where most of the risk lies, because if the underlying plummets below your strike you're fucked. The deeper ITM you buy, the more the option replicates the stock and the safer it is.  3) Leverage  Simply put, leverage is the price of 100 shares of the underlying divided by the premium spent on the option. The idea being that you have exposure to 100 shares for a fraction of the price it would be to purchase 100 shares.  The mover levered you are, the less risk you are exposed to and the more efficient your returns will be.  Purchasing the option is a balancing act between risk, efficiency, and leverage. The risk is in the strike price, the efficiency is in the expiration, and the leverage is in how much you're wanting to pony up to enter the position. Find out where your sweet spot is and act accordingly.  # Where To Sell My Short?  So you've purchased your long call, and are ready to gain some theta. Don't listen to the guys at r/thetagang who tell you to sell 1 month out and close at 50% profit, you're leaving gains on the table for no reason other than it's less maintenance to manage the position. Sell weeklies!  There are two main principles here to keep in mind:  1) The farther OTM you sell your option, the less premium earned (obviously) 2) The more your call goes ITM, the harder and more expensive it is to roll.  Many like to sell their calls around .3 Delta, which is typically about a 10% increase in the underlying. I typically sell mine around .4 to .45, which ends up being close to double the amount of premium earned. My thought process is that I want to maximize my profit if the stock trades sideways, and if the stock shoots up I'm earning intrinsic value in my long as opposed to earning premium.  If you're new to this, I would recommend selling a few at .3 Delta until you understand how the trade behaves.   # What If The Underlying Blows Past My Short?  Quick answer: Roll UP and OUT. **The most important thing in this play is to protect your long call**  Rolling your option means selling the current one, and buying one at a later date and higher strike price. Since the longer DTE option has more extrinsic value, you can often do this either as a neutral trade or for a credit. Lets go through three scenarios to see how we can manage these trades.  # How To Roll Your Short Call Effectively  Rule of thumb- unless you have a good reason to, don't let any days go by without having a short call. Every day without a short call is less theta earned. Also, you want to buy back the contract when it has the lowest amount of extrinsic value, which is Friday.  Scenario 1- You sell XYZ 50c and the underlying is OTM or slightly ITM  Wait until the extrinsic value is near zero, wait until Friday afternoon and buy the option back and immediately sell your next play at your desired Delta level. We do NOT want to let the contract expire for two reasons: 1) take advantage of weekend theta decay and 2) in the event the underlying shoots up AH, you aren't at risk for assignment. This is best case scenario.  Scenario 2- You sell XYZ 50c and the underlying is ITM by 5-10%  Here, our goal is to buy the option back and to sell one expiring the following week at a HIGHER strike price. This allows us to increase the distance between the strikes, which is a good thing for us. If the option is ITM by ~10% in Thursday afternoon, I will consider rolling then instead of waiting until Friday but I will typically wait until Friday morning-ish. In this scenario, I will look for as even of a trade as I can but it may be possible to do this for a credit, but again that is your personal preference. When we do this, we won't be earning any premium the following week.  Scenario 3- You sell XYZ 50c and it it moons up 10-20% or more  Our goal here is to PROTECT OUR LONG CALL. I will take a look at how much extrinsic value it has, and once it gets close to the underlying price I will roll at that point. The difference between this and scenario 2 is that you may have to roll it out multiple weeks as opposed to 1, and you may have to roll it out before Thursday, depending how fukt you are. Still, this situation can be rectified and it a good position to be in at the end of the day because you're making bank on your long call.  # Positions  RKT 21c March 2021|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1552610|public|confidence|self|||Options 101 Episode 3: Lowering Your Cost Basis With A PMCC|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/javgnv/options_101_episode_3_lowering_your_cost_basis/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

However it is important, and can help you make money if you pay attention to it in times like this. If you need a refresher on what gamma is here is some background.  An options Delta is the chance that an contract will expire ITM. For instance, deep ITM contracts delta will be close to 1.00 because it has a near 100% chance of profitability. While an OTM contract will have deltas closer to 0.  Gamma is literally the derivative of delta, or the rate of change of delta. Its value will show how much a contracts delta changes when the underlying stock goes up or down $1. So if your OTM contracts delta changes from 0.1 to 0.3 when GME moves up $1 that contracts gamma at that time would be 0.2.  Gamma shouldn't be ignored because it shows you the rate of change of your chances of ""winning"" in real time. Imagine a coin flip where in mid air the chance of landing tails changes from 50% to 60%, pretty solid information.  &amp;#x200B;  **What does high GEX mean?**  A high GEX means the market is currently skewed towards call options. A GEX of 15,000,000,000 means that for every 1% move down on the S&amp;P, MMs have to sell 15B shares they bought as hedges for the calls they sold. This would push the price down further and further. A high GEX puts the breaks on the current market price action and means MMs expect a change to happen soon.  &amp;#x200B;  [SPY and GEX \(10\/12\/20\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek920p23yys51.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=794b0f74985012c2c3771442c4154e221e979eb0)  This chart (although a day old and doesn't show the 15B spike today) shows that high GEX doesn't mean an immediate market crash. In fact in the past year GEX is only a decent indicator of corrections in the mid term future. However a GEX of 15 Billion has never been seen before and we should keep a close eye on it and DIX to get a better idea about where we are going this month.  &amp;#x200B;  Have some opinions on high GEX?

I placed call options on GME and TSLA that are going to expire worthless tmrw. It was my hope that I could double up $20k and make $60k profit in just over a month. Even though I am up $20k still I feel like it is nothing. All that hard earned money expired worthless. Do I just cash out $20k and call it “profit”, make more yolo calls and either make it all back or lose it all, or start “investing”??  Looking for both autistic and non autistic advice.

It’s a catalyst (and a super small cap stock)! Why GME rallies after teaming up with MSFT? Catalyst... and once again a small cap.

We don’t care about P/E... we don’t care about monkey analysts dragging their predictions up as we push the prices... balance sheets- what are those? No one invests for dividends anymore. Yes, Cramer, I don’t want to invest in a dinosaur company because they are giving me 1c back a share!   But we do care about short activities (who here didn’t have a good tendie dinner from a nice squeeze?), we also care about hype, proper DD (like buying GLDD instead of GLD because of ticker similarities).

Let's take a closer look at the announcement. The key word is **""multi-year""**  ""GameStop Corp.

""Coupled with arguably one of GameStop's most important developments, the just-announced **10-year agreement with Microsoft** to modernize the retailer's back-end operations and expand its digital and physical game options, there is hope for the company's future.""  Does the agreement suggest that GameStop will survive for another **10 years**? If so it is 10 more years then the shorts expected.  It also seems that some analyst have been dismissive over the details of the agreement. The recent partnership involves **""revenue sharing""** which will benefit GameStop**.**  Verified by an email from DOMO Capital's **Justin Dopierala** to GameStop. Here is GameStop's response:  "" GameStop and Microsoft will both benefit from the customer acquisition and **lifetime revenue** **value** of each gamer brought into the Xbox ecosystem.""

So the one time in my life I guess right, I bought a calm instead of a put.  After I sold the contract at a loss, I bought a put.   This morning I was going to sell the put and instead of selling it, I bought another put. So I pretty much did it again.  When I realized what I did I sold both of them for $25 loss per contract instead of just breaking even.   I guess I could take some screen shots for proof but I don’t want to do that.

I am almost 22 and have been addicted to World of Warcraft (WoW) since like 5th grade. WoW has been the heroine in my veins for the longest time and I am officially putting an end to this toxic relationship (I have tried quitting plenty of times before and always came crawling back). There are a ton of different reasons on why I am stopping (this isn’t my diary so i'm getting straight to the DD) but the biggest reason has to do with the future of the game and how the end is near. Go take a look at WoW’s major streaming content (Asmongold, Payo, Rich, Sodapoppin, Savix). Go take a look at WoW subscription numbers and you’ll understand what I mean. Go check out WoW’s most recent delay of their upcoming expansion, it's very similar to their worst launch ever of a video game (Warcraft 3 Reforged). I could write an entire college thesis on the future of World of Warcraft and all the shitty parts of the game. Moral of the story, this game is dying faster than GME.  If you have read this post so far you are prolly a gay bear and thinking “puts puts puts” but no. As I do believe this expansion is going to be THE most god awful thing to ever happen to World of Warcraft since Warlords of Draenor, I think this bad news is going to be a real “buy the dip faggot” type of opportunity for ATVI. When this expansion comes out it's going to be a publicity hurricane like no other. I have no numbers or anything to back this up besides when I picture this happening my balls tingle real good. This expansion is gunna be like a shit stain for ATVI that won’t be able to be washed out, but how can you smell that over a new pair of Brunello Cucinelli pants (COVID). COVID has created a recipe for financial success, made an easy way to increase margins, and the given potential to grow revenue from 32A to 36H tities. But at the end of the day it's tough to sell a shit product.  Now this next earnings for ATVI is brighter than any other company out there. They have perfected the art of putting in as little effort possible in order to maximize seasonal revenues (Christmas is right around the corner faggots). From personal experience I know how good Blizzard is at taking people’s money. I think the best way to explain ATVI’s art at exploiting people’s addiction is like that gold digger chick that gives “free” blowjobs. In reality you have to bring her out to lunch (buy new expansions), take her to a movie theatre (pay subscriptions), order takeout for dinner (pay to win), and let her sleep at your place (bad content) just to get a blowjob before she leaves in the morning. You get these “free” blowjobs for almost 10 years of your life and then you realize you can go to the alley out back with a jar of peanut butter and get the same results (old 2007 video games).   I like to think that when one era ends a new era begins. This is ThE sTarT oF soMEthIng uNiQuE for ATVI aka REMASTERING OLD GAMES. Why put the effort into making a new game from scratch when you can just remake/reskin/update games from the past that people loved. It’s pretty much the same thing Disney is doing with their “Live Action Movies''. It's an endless cycle of recreating titles that are instant money grabs for simps who miss their childhood (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 &amp; 2, the next Black Ops, Crash Bandicoot 4, WoW classic, etc). This is where the easy/big money is going to be made in their future.   I like to think that quitting WoW before was never successful for myself because I didn’t have anything to replace it. Now I will trade one addiction (WoW) for my next (stonks). I see this play as my only way to properly make all my money back that I gave to ATVI and transition from one addiction to another. The way is no longer to Shadowlands but instead to Vahlaha. God's speed faggots.  Btw I still have 3 prepaid months left on my WoW subscription so I think that's a good time frame to place my calls.

Some even compare it to NKLA (a fraud company with business under it besides pretty renders).  I'm very bullish on GME, mainly for the short squeeze of a lifetime, but a solid argument could still be made for a company itself.  Here I'll try to list main bear points, comment if I forgot something, I'll add it to the post. My goal is to build the most precise model of what is happening and I do not want to blindly follow the hype train, so please criticize what you think is wrong and together we'll find the truth.  **1. The squeeze already happened, from 5 to 15**  Facts: most shorts were in a 7$ and therefore were slightly underwater at 9. Yes, we've had huge volume during Thursday and Friday and one may say that all shorts covered already. However, half the volume (about 50m) during those couple of days were new shorts (source: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). So if we even accept the premise that all 60m shorts covered we still have 50m shorted which is close to 100% float again. The reality is that there are probably quite a number of old bears still holding the line and who are heavily underwater.  This is what REAL short squeeze looks like: VW Oct 2008 The Great Squeeze  Also, look at shares available to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME  **2. Gamestop has a dying business model and is not going to last long-term**  Well yes, but you're looking at what Gamestop was. They are actively trying to turn the company's course around right now with a help from Ryan Cohen who at the very least has an excellent experience in managing and growing retail business. In itself it might be a questionable bullish case, but the market has a GameStop bankruptcy priced-in at 7$ and a perspective of a turn-around is a massive deviation from that common sentiment.  About the long-term thing: go to fucking /r/investing for that. Nobody's telling that this company is going to be a beast in 20 years time. The main point is that they're not dying, possibly growing somewhat and have an enormous potential for a huge squeeze. The following year or two after the consoles release are going to be explosive as it has every time before, which is also enough time for management to come up with new ways for a company to live besides selling games and consoles.  My wild guesses: PC bangs, e-sports involvement, gaming stuff (I know they already are, but there is a lot of space to grow in that direction)  Michael Burry involvement is also a somewhat convincing argument.  **3. Strong balance sheets **  You are seriously telling me that a market cap of 700m$ is adequate for a company which generated 6.5b$ revenue in 2019, having 2.3b$ in assets and 700m$ with cash on hands? And a company during the new console season which historically drive the price up to the tits  **4. Physical sales are decreasing compared to digital **  Yes, in percentages. But you should also account for the overall growth of the gaming market, and an argument can be made that total numbers are not decreasing that much. Now excuse me on this one, I can't manage to find exact stats in numbers and not in percentages (I've seen it a while ago somewhere on this sub), so if anyone has it please post.  Summary:   * Gamestop isn't going to go bankrupt anytime soon   * It is being overshorted with the premise that it is going to be bankrupt   * The company actively tries to change it's course, so we would have a lot of positive news incoming   * Every tiny piece of positive news is being multiplied tenfold by the short-sellers being underwater   * Shares are heavily underpriced on what GME has right now in cash and revenue, and we're not even talking about possible company's revival   * We're at wsb, not at fucking /r/investing. I always thought wsb was all about high-risk high-reward calculated bets.

I own a bunch of calls and am considering trimming positions a little to take some profits. I figured it would be good to consolidate together a bunch of the DD and points I've seen on this sub over the last month  I understand the short squeeze theory: right now \~106% of shares outstanding and more like \~150% of the public float is shorted.  For a short squeeze, you need one of these things to happen:  * A large shareholder rapidly buying shares and then saying they are not going to lend these shares out (see what happened with Porsche-Volkswagen in 2008) * Merger &amp; acquisition rumors / speculation * Change in long-term prospects of the business that fundamentally changes the thesis of everyone short * Catalyst for capitulation of the shorts (i.e. they realize they are wrong / are losing too much money in the short-term and close out positions)  In the case of GME:  * Shorts have not started capitulating - the short interest chart above shows short interest as % of shares outstanding actually increasing over the past several months  * The Microsoft news is a bit of non-news, but could also be a positive:    * The partnership does not appear to have any meaningful economics for GME    * However, the positive signaling is that why would Microsoft announce a long-term partnership with GME if they don't think it will be around for at least a couple more years    * Longer-term, if the partnership is valuable for Microsoft, there could be more meaningful support / economics provided to GME * Ryan Cohen (Chewy Co-Founder) has taken a big stake    * Helps remove a large % of shares out of the public float    * If he gets more involved, perhaps he has a vision for how to transform GME in a more digital videogame world - this would be a big catalyst * Michael Burry still owned a large chunk as of 6/30/2020 - will be interesting to see what his holdings look like on the next report date * Most importantly, the thesis of hedge funds that are short has not changed - the medium-term prospects of GME are bleak, especially after the initial wave of foot traffic from the console sales    * Mall traffic is down - COVID only accelerated the decline of malls    * GME's footprint of 5,500+ stores seems like its unsustainable in the long-run - question is can they trim the footprint fast enough to a smaller, more profitable footprint that they will be around in the long-run * The short squeeze feels like it will be a battle of who has more conviction and a longer time horizon - the hedge funds who are short or the WSB traders who are long    * I love all of you guys, but I don't have much faith in WSB having more conviction / longer investment horizon than hedge funds (and by longer I mean who is willing to hold their position for a year to see it play out)  I do agree with the members on this sub that you can make money trading GME in the short-term, potentially seeing a rally up - but this is probably not going to be a LT winner  Please add anything you think I have missed or where you think I am wrong  Position: $6c 1/15/2021 since mid Sep (screenshot attached)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1546018|public|confidence|self|||GME DD Discussion: Short Interest is Increasing|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j965he/gme_dd_discussion_short_interest_is_increasing/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Playstation 5 digital edition ps now and ps plus(which i guarantee will be rehauled to compete) Switch already making a push with eshop purchases up yty.   The only upside is that gamestop recently announced a partnership for them to leverage microsoft infrastructure in their retail outlets.  This isnt any different than when sears signed a massive purchase order for ipads and iPhones to spruce things up.   The industry is moving entirely away from physical.  Not to mention for those such as myself that but physical go to bestbuy, target, amazon, Walmart and the clubs like sams and Costco to buy them. Also regional electronic stores like frys or pcrichard.  While I agree on a fundamental basis gme is undervalued so was blackberry. Im not saying gamestop won't be able to have a few more squeezes.. much like sears did as they were struggling.   Gamestop will most likely drop from this recent squeeze. Sell any pops.

They are currently 1.63 so im not really in any pain besides unrealized gains guh.   The arguments against GME :  1. They are just buying Microsoft tablets.  Not true they are entering a multi year strategic partnership which allows them to get some royalties when customers sign up for Xbox live (which will be free for 2 years when customers buy from them.. worth af). Also Microsoft closed all their stores so they are positioned from a customer access and strategic physical standpoint.   2. Hurr durr all games are online no need for physical store.   Autist, have you tried to download cod on your Xbox? Most people buy the cheap consoles with the least amount of space. Cod literally takes up a third of my memory. Same with gta v and other big games like Skyrim. You can only store so many games.   Ps5 just said 80-90% of games are going to be backwards compatible meaning discs and pre owned games will still be important and a physical marketplace will continue to exist.   (Hurr durr cloud gaming will take over) —&gt; agreed but google stadia is at early adoption stage and Jedi for Microsoft won’t be viable until a few years.   Also nerds buy their fanboy shit from stores, and GameStop is the strongest nerd merch store nationally.

Some of you know my story about my diamond hands on GME **h0dl**ing over 46 thousand shares buying at the 10s and 11s level and was stuck in a rut.   October 9, I was down about -**90k** because GME was trading in the low 9s before the MSFT announcement.  After the announcement, when GME traded at high $14s, I was up from $430s to $600k in my whole account at around 11 AM 10/9/2020 because I was sitting diamond hands with 46k shares... LUCKILY, I rolled down my calls from 15 to 12.5s and 13s to capture intrinsic value and hope to end the week flat.   I went to work.    **WTF...GME was like a shit show dropping from $14s to low $13s...** calls were wasted and I was partially hedged, which was somewhat good.  At least it was above my strikes expecting to get called away over the weekend. So, I didn't do anything.  About 2:15-2:45 PM, mid-call with an old customer, literally watched my GME drop from the 13s all the way down to the low $12s (**dumping was really fast if you looked at the chart**), costing me about **-40k** plus of my potential gains.  (not allowed to trade while talking to clients\*\*\*)  This old yeller was literally bitching for almost 30 minutes about how company procedure sucks, and how we were giving him a massive burden because we couldn't authenticate his outdated/missing credentials.  He kept repeating himself yada yada yada.  And I was stuck watching my trade screen forking tens of thousands in less than an hour.   **I WAS VENTING ON THE INSIDES and was in a rush TO TAKE ACTION BUT he kept me on the phone.  Can't abruptly hang up the call on him either.**    **THIS GUY COST ME A WHOLE SALARY in less than HOUR.**   It was 2:50PM or so when I was done with this guy.  Closed more than 80% of my positions (I had very complex trades, so they take time to set up) closing short calls/short puts/long stock...my account dropped from 600s to 560s in less than 1 hour because I couldn't take proper action.  By instinct, I quickly reduced the risk to end the weekend...**I am still not flat with 7k shares at risk due to covered calls (they don't reduce risk when stocks are plummeting fast...)**   Hopefully, Monday wouldn't be another shitshow.  My trade would have been up about $130k from Oct 9 to Oct 10, but failure to take proper action only allowed me to realize about **$90k in realized profits in one day's time.**  For your knowledge, it's not only painful to lose your principal, it's just as painful lose your gains, and it's even more painful to NOT be able to do anything when know you needed to take action.  This is a costly learning experience.  Have a nice weekend.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1543186|public|confidence|self|||Gamestop PART 2...

This is normal.  The squeeze didn't trigger today, but that doesn't mean shorts aren't going to have to cover in the coming week, and it doesn't mean the stock isn't going to go back up.    Take a look at the chart for the past couple of months. [https://i.imgur.com/hiijNL0.png](https://i.imgur.com/hiijNL0.png)  It spikes, then bleeds down, then spikes, then bleeds down.  Yesterday's spike was the largest, so it makes the others look a little less crazy, but there are a lot of 20-30% days in there.  The main thing to notice there though, is that each spike is higher, and each bleed stops at a higher price than the one before.  &amp;#x200B;  Buy FDs and short dated calls at one's own peril.  Take some profits after each spike, buy back in after it drops if you like.  Safest way to do so is via shares, which you can swap back out for calls eventually if you want greater profit exposure.  IV bleed is serious in between runs, but its hard to know when it is going to jump again, so exiting entirely can lead to a lot of regret as I have learned firsthand.  January 15c, 30c and shares.

See my post history.   Here's my 3rd attempt. YES, GME climbed a ton today. You'd be an idiot to buy in now. Right? Maybe.   Here's why maybe not.   1) Go here. [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities). GME has been on the list since 9/22. How many days ago is that? 13 market days.   2) Read SEC rules here: [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). In particular, look at section IV:    *In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days.*[*\[10\]*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) *Threshold securities are equity securities*[*\[11\]*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) *that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.*  **Now put 1) &amp; 2) together.**   Now decide how much you're willing to lose and look into AH purchases.

Also out this week is ""Baldur's Gate 3,"" a role-playing game by Larian Studios. The game rolls out in early access on October 6 on Microsoft Windows, macOS (AAPL), and Google Stadia (GOOG).  **PIPER ENGAGEMENT NOTE:** Piper Sandler analyst Yung Kim said in a research note released earlier that the firm's semiannual survey of over 9,800 students indicated increased video games engagement across the board, with teens playing daily up to 31% versus 26% in the Spring 2020 survey. Kim said that a primary beneficiary was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), as after a summer of staying at home, teens chose ""Call of Duty: Warzone"" as the free-to-play title they play the most at 62%, up from 33% in the previous survey. The analyst sees the data as positive for console publishers Activision, EA, and Take-Two (TTWO), as well as mobile publishers Zynga (ZNGA) and Glu Mobile (GLUU).  **BARRON'S:** Max A. Cherney wrote [in a article for Barron's last week ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-are-a-huge-deal-for-gamers-heres-what-it-means-for-investors-51601682443?mod=past_editions)that videogame stocks are expected to get another major boost. For the past six months, nothing has shown up on time but there's one major consumer event proceeding as scheduled next month, namely the launch of new videogame consoles from Microsoft and Sony, Cherney said, noting that pre-orders for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 sold out in a matter of hours last month, despite their $500 price tags. Shares of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive Software are each up at least 24% this year, but if history is any guide, there are more gains to come, the author added. Cherney also noted that the next-generation consoles arrive with games ""atop the entertainment pecking order,"" especially as many movie theaters are closed and Americans are still stuck at home. The author highlighted that, according to IDC, U.S. videogame sales are forecast to rise 19% this year to $45.6B, while the U.S. film box office peaked at $11.9B in 2018 and has grossed just $1.9B in 2020 so far.  **OTHER STORIES TO WATCH:**  * Last Thursday, Blizzard announced that the release date for ""World of Warcraft: Shadowlands,"" the new expansion for the company's acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game, had been delayed, with executive producer John Hight saying that it is ""important"" for the company to ""deliver an experience that meets our highest expectations."" The game was originally slated for a late October launch, but Blizzard said it will instead be out later this year. * Video game platform Roblox is working with investment banks to prepare to go public in the U.S. in a listing that could arrive in early 2021, [Reuters reported last week.](https://in.reuters.com/article/roblox-ipo/exclusive-us-gaming-platform-roblox-prepares-to-go-public-sources-idINL8N2GS5UV) * In other listing news, U.S. mobile gaming company AppLovin, which is backed by KKR (KKR), has tapped Morgan Stanley (MS) to lead preparations for an IPO which could arrive early next year, [Reuters said yesterday.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-applovin-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-mobile-gaming-firm-applovin-hires-morgan-stanley-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN26Q31T?il=0) * Ubisoft (UBSFY) CEO Yves Guillemot said in a message to employees that 25% of anonymous respondents in an internal summer survey reported witnessing or experiencing misconduct first-hand, [according to Kotaku's Ethan Gach.](https://kotaku.com/one-in-four-ubisoft-employees-witnessed-or-experienced-1845256218) * EA announced yesterday that ""Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered,"" a remake of 2010's ""Need for Speed Hot Pursuit"" will be coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 6, and to Nintendo Switch on November 13.  *Symbols: EA SNE MSFT NTDOY AAPL GOOG GOOGL ATVI TTWO ZNGA GLUU KKR MS UBSFY TCEHY GME*"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1534076|public|confidence|self|||Gaming Bets - Piper survey notes gaming engagement boost among teens|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j68kst/gaming_bets_piper_survey_notes_gaming_engagement/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'osioubpsFlCuXrSOr2rw7X1wOx-RVWGSfYNkqHLgTtQ', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=badfcc5120fea784676c3ee34e5c44e81e0ba0db', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ca6aa817f5a31405d6fa48c37badcad7b2fca05', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31e4ab2360005a7ff48553a156ed4ea99a6c2732', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=387739a77163b26487bd66a40c4cd7b753516f0b', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30aaccf7ce30503a938668b6d005f67f95da3ae8', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0769d2a30759cc3f830bea019827ab58b815dcc3', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BH7WdfkXtLvysOmnOXth3PijSCWssP6Eh8kishwapPg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ff1b0f7bdca99831daae052a1f72551593097da4', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||

And you get it: short squeeze, something something Burry, console cycle, aight you're sold, right?  The problem is, we've been promised this balls to walls short squeeze for a long time now. But the truth is, no one knows when it's actually going to happen. It feels like it's happening, the beginnings are there at least, with GME up like 50% in the past month. But this is just the tip y'all.   So here's how we play GME.  1. Sell OTM cash secured puts, way way out like Nov 20, $9 strike which you get $150 premium for. Now I know y'all be dumbasses and only know how to buy calls and puts, but the purpose of selling puts is that you collect premium, and if you're ever assigned, then great you get to own some delish cheap GME stocks (at the price of whatever strike you sold at). If you're not assigned, well also great, you collected some cold hard cash. 2. Buy OTM calls, like way out Nov 20 $10 strike. Now I know you retards understand this part. We think stonks go up, especially by Nov with the console cycle.  Now keep in mind buying OTM calls is way cheaper because you've sold puts. Instead of paying $200/contract, now you're paying $50.   Now for the few of you that are still with me, what I've described is basically a **risk reversal.** You've got a fat upside without the cost basis of an outright call.   Aight thats it.

First some background.  VALE is a mining company based in Brazil that is supposedly the world's largest iron and nickel ore producer.  Metals are supposedly on the up, so yay or whatever.  I'm sure you all remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna_play_tsla_but_no_money_vale/) by our current resident persona non grata u/ExtraEgg.  IMO it was pretty solid DD up until the conspiracy theories involving Elon sending coded messages through his tweets, and one would think that EVs needing nickel for batteries would have a positive effect on the largest nickel miner in the world, but something nefarious is going on, and it may have something to do with us, the retail trader and WSB.  The MMs and dark pools know more than we do, that's a given with just about anything.  They typically play us like a fiddle and feast on our ignorance and stupidity.  Some have admitted to doing so, as referenced by the article a couple weeks ago highlighting Wall Street poring over WSB to find out what we were piling into so they could make money off us.  This may be such a play, and I'm convinced it was designed to take the shirts off the backs of retail traders from the get-go.  So real quick about dark pools:  they're exactly what they sound like.  Large funds that are allowed to make big block trades without screwing with price action.  They should be illegal, but like most aspects of the market, they were designed to manage their risk and fuck us over at the same time.  [So here's what the dark pools have been doing with VALE.](https://i.imgur.com/YTsSJPu.png)  This is all action from today, 9/29.  These are big fucking blocks of shares being bought, obviously by dark pools, because if you didn't notice, Vale got nominal price action early today and then shat itself as usual.  This is what people are pointing to when they say there is big buy volume going on in VALE.  But there's another type of volume spiking, and it's what really gets the Twitter pumpers frothing at the mouth.  These are the insane call volumes that people have been shouting about, this was today:  [31k contracts of VALE 15c 1/15/21 for $272k](https://i.imgur.com/S0ZaqSQ.png)  [15k contracts of VALE 15c 3/19/21 for $225k](https://i.imgur.com/m7FXtui.png)  [2.2k contracts of VALE 12c 1/21/22 for $243k](https://i.imgur.com/6bwbQjB.png)  Obviously those are big numbers, and people have been shouting about them for over a week and they're still being bought, but I haven't seen much mention of the puts:  [31k contracts of VALE 15p 1/15/21 for $14.53 million fucking dollars American](https://i.imgur.com/Zb8zc25.png)  [15k contracts of VALE 15p 3/19/21 for $7.55m](https://i.imgur.com/6CDkfMB.png)  [5k contracts of VALE 10p 1/21/22 for $1.04m](https://i.imgur.com/dDZBmcM.png)  Honestly I didn't have to make an entire post to say the insane call option volume is simply a hedge, but I need to work through this because it's so belligerent it's making my head spin.  What about the insane share blocks being bought?  As u/gege12345572 [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j272rv/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_september_30_2020/g745agi/), it's possible that they're intent on selling us as many calls as they can since our call volume the last couple weeks has been insane and some, like my retarded self, have been steadily averaging down as recently as Friday.  It could also be another part of the hedge.  This whole thing could be some elaborate stage play where insiders have information on the CEO of VALE diddling kiddos or something and cash out big on the puts, then ride it back up when nickel rises in value.  I don't fucking know, but they're buying HUGE amounts of deep ITM puts and OTM calls stretching all the way to 2022.  Make of that what you will.  My advice: get out if you're still in.  Unless you're already max pain like I am.  Then godspeed, you lunatics.  The calls are so fucking cheap for leaps that if you're a gambling addict or believe the hedge isn't really a hedge but an actual play, then go ahead.  But this is sinister, my dudes.  These guys know what's up and we just don't.

Today we're going to learn about short squeezes. Shorts are gay bears who borrow stock to sell it, under the mistaken impression that stocks can go down. There are two ways that short sellers lose money. The first is the simple and obvious one. If the stock goes up, the retard who shorted it might have to buy it back at a higher price than he sold it, incurring a loss. The second way is the borrow rate. Obviously brokers and banks only let people like us trade so they can steal our money. One way they steal our money is by having the audacity to charge interest on borrowed shares.  Now, the key here is that as more shares are shorted and it's harder to borrow new shares to sell short, the *borrow rate rises*. It can rise very, very quickly. Since we're all poor and have no access to real data, we'll use iborrowdesk.com to get a sense of the borrow rates. While the rate on iborrow might not be accurate for all market participants and brokers, it should go up and down with the average borrow rate across the market.  Gamestop is showing as a 39% borrow rate, with 15,000 shares available to short.  Virgin Galactic is showing at a 3% borrow rate, with hundreds of thousands of shares available to short.  What this tells us is that the gay bears are paying very little money to short Virgin Virgin, but are paying out the fucking nose to short Chad Gamestop. As the share price of both stocks rise, the short sellers of Gamestop will be taking a *considerably* heavier loss, especially if the borrow rate stays elevated.  Positions:  GME shares because I have no fucking idea what options will do if this time bomb goes off. The other GME guy made like a million on calls though, January LEAPS aren't a bad idea.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1524384|public|confidence|self|||Why Gamestop Might Squeeze But Virgin Galactic Won't|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j2672c/why_gamestop_might_squeeze_but_virgin_galactic/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

If any information is in accurate or misunderstood on my part feel free to to correct me; I am by no means an expert.   As I have come to understand, a security will make the list after failing to deliver shares for a position. Time starts ticking day one, and at day T+3 it makes the list if the dollar value of the position meets the threshold established by the SEC. This is most often associated with opening short positions, as the shares for the short position must be borrowed to be sold.   HOWEVER from what I’ve managed to gather; the position is allowed to be opened and it becomes the brokers responsibility to then find shares to borrow after the fact. They do not need to be available at the time of the order being opened. This is where a stock making the list comes into play. After 13 days however, any positions opened that still have not had shares located to fulfill the brokers obligation MUST be closed, and the must be bought from from the open market.   Now as I originally started my research into this to make my decision for GME, I will use that as an example. They made the list the 22nd. That would make the original date of failure to deliver the 16th. So if my understanding is correct, and it may not be 100%, the 29th would start the forced closing of all positions which have not had sufficient amounts of shares located for borrow.   Aside from my original purpose of researching this, it seems this list would be a powerful tool to find possible squeeze candidates. Critique and further in depth explanation welcome. This is not financial advice, flame away whatever I don’t give a fuck.

I am still in most of my positions and I am a believer that this thing still has quite a ways to pop to the upside. This is less of DD about GME's rise so far and more focused on the prospect of further short squeezing   Twice a month short floats are reported (the 1st and 15th of the month) and are published a few days later. Yesterday the GME short interest from the September 15th report was released and the numbers are very encouraging that there is much short squeeze left to be had.  [The Short float percentage was 136&amp;#37; on Sept 15th, this means for every one real share there are 1.3 \\""paper shares\\"" that are sold short, this is a crazy short float!](https://preview.redd.it/2uz4qehdhcp51.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a16f7c3f10ae90a1de26d0ae65ac656dda62540a)  It's important to remember that this is data that is 10 days old and the closing price on the 15th was $7.09 compared to currently trading around $9.75. The Bears would argue that this \~37% move to the upside was the entire short squeeze, but while there may have been some short covering along that move from $7 to $9, I believe that this thing is still stretched on the short side and there is still substantial upside opportunity.  [Short float is continuing to rise regardless of price action](https://preview.redd.it/x36bzuclhcp51.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d21faacffe8cee2ae0114d6b535996bc2cc78f6)  High short interest is not a new concept for GME, but it is important to look at the behavior of the bears relative to the price action leading up to this price move. Looking back at the short float from the end of July we can attempt to gain some insight into the mentality of the short sellers. In the first half of August as the price shot up more than 65% the overall short float rose by 2.2%, then again in the back half of August the short float rose by an additional 3.9% despite a 26% decline in price.  This means that the bears appear to be operating under the assumption that GME is going to crash below $4 and ultimately go to 0. They see a rising price as an opportunity to short it at a higher price and they are not taking gains off the table when the stock pulls back as it did in the back half of August. This means that there is still a lot of overconfidence and greed on the short side of the GME trade, both things that point to a potentially massive short squeeze.  Now let look at that latest short float update from the 15th of September that was just released yesterday. In first half of September the share price rose by 17%, and the short float sky rocketed an additional 15%! This means that as the stock rose above $7 a share the short float rose to an astounding 136%! For those that don't know, this means that every single share of GameStop stock has been borrowed to be sold short and a third of them have been borrowed to be short a second time this is the exact conditions we want to see for a good long and hard short squeeze!  [SLB Rate represents the annual interest that Bears are paying to borrow shares](https://preview.redd.it/t5d6g0sqhcp51.png?width=1657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f7dc15308e3da6532f5ffcfbd48c97b2dbb2f44)  Looking at the stock borrowing prices as a proxy for short volume over the last 10 days, we can see that while the borrowing rates did drop between the 17th and the 23rd they have stabilized and are rising again. This means that while there was some short covering that pushed the stock temporarily up to $11, I believe that there is still a massive short interest open in GME and as the console sales + holiday season roll on there is much potential for positive surprises that will trigger a violent move to the upside that will lead to the real forced buying that comes with a true short squeeze.

There have been several DD's on GME this month so I just wanted to provide another perspective that gives evidence to the fact that the risk/reward on the LONG side is very attractive.   Let's take a look at GME's balance sheet as of 2Q20.  https://preview.redd.it/5s7xoxo8mbp51.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf72617aceef6cc36e90c89c0284d69ba036c7f  As you can see above, GME has $735.1MM of cash on hand, $221.3MM of short-term debt, and $215.9MM of long-term debt. That means GME has a net cash position of $297.9M! If GME were to stop all operations, shut down all stores, and never sell a console again, equity value would be the value of cash less debt, or $297.9M. At the time of writing this post, GME's market cap is $638.7M. The market is implying that GME's future earnings are worth $340.8M (in other words, the current market cap minus net cash position).   Now, it is clear that GME's core business is in the shitter. Let's not deny that. Revenue continues to decline as disc sales disappear, and gross margins are trending down due to many factors including mix shift (consoles are lower GM% than discs), but there are some bright spots over the next 6 months. For one, a new console cycle is just beginning and when GME makes it to 4Q20, there will be a nice revenue bump that can send shorts screaming. Then you introduce the activist attention. I worked at HF for several years and if there's one thing I learned, it's that it's very hard to short an activist. They can make a lot of noise and even if results don't follow, the higher probability of success results in a higher multiple. In this case, we even may see results in 4Q, and even if they aren't a result of an activist, it will get people excited (or spooked in the case of short sellers).   GME $12C 10/30exp for the short-term juice, GME $22C 1/15/21exp for the 4Q bump.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1519214|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ynMacH25MuHzIoGH5eDASP-jJMMIkMdR9NLAbVk96AU.jpg|94.0|140.0|Long GME (a balance sheet DD)|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/izmt4l/long_gme_a_balance_sheet_dd/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp)  Key Takeaways  A threshold list is a list of securities **that failed to settle** in the previous five trading days.  They are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.  These settlement failures may be **indicative of naked short selling**, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors.  What is naked short selling?   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)  Illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Despite being made illegal after 2008 financial crisis naked shorting continues due to certain loopholes.   On 9/24/2020 the **Uptick Rule was triggered and comes into effect for GME on 9/25/2020.**   **Understanding the Uptick Rule**  The Uptick Rule prevents sellers from accelerating the downward momentum of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick. The uptick rule prevents MM and short sellers from essentially doing this.       **Potential Catalysts:**  Share buybacks  [The last time they bought shares back was in October 2019 and it resulted in a 30&amp;#37; spike in a month.](https://preview.redd.it/exdgc2pajbp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2022f97a1e2b3121bdf433fc81c2026a8e1a7c)  &amp;#x200B;  [OCT 2019 Spike](https://preview.redd.it/42sschyfjbp51.png?width=197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6588395574b74d52de511932d9bd964600a5330b)      **Ryan Cohen:**  Mr. Cohen had previously been CEO of Chewy, which he took from the ground up to the largest online retailer for pet goods. He knows how to get a company profitable and then sell it at a huge profit.  He's had absolutely nothing to do for 2 years and his other 2 biggest investments before disclosing his shares in GME are in Apple and Wells Fargo, both of which are too big for him to buy outright, but GME only has a marketcap of 654 or so million, so he's in luck. He can buy the whole thing and take it private if he wants to. My personal opinion is that he wants to become CEO.   **Michael Burry:**  Mr. Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, could decide to buy shares to force the squeeze and then his options and share are worth hundreds of millions. He has enough capital to do this by himself if he wanted.   [https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value](https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value)  Burry's Portfolio is here.

This is called Naked Short Selling and is technically illegal except under some very narrow circumstances. What happens later is they are then unable to deliver these securities at settlement date and have a very short window to buy and deliver these securities. The expectation is that the Market Makers will buy these shares at a better price and can make additional money.

I've been to **GME** once in the last five years and there was a homeless man eating a corndog behind the counter and I wasn't sure if he worked there or not. Gay bears stop reading now.  &amp;#x200B;  So the Bulls are dead, the bulls market has ended? I think not. Together we are strong and we hold more power than the boys on Wall St. Always remember when the chips are down the autists have an extra surge of strength. This is commonly referred to as tard strength, this is us.     Now lets get to the actual fucking **DD** now that the foreplay is over with. **\~\~START HERE IF YOUR ON THE SPECTRUM\~\~**     **GME** has had a rough time over the last five years, with thousands of brick and mortar stores closing and people realizing that digital is the new storage medium of choice for games. However, this year is different. People are stuck inside due to the pandemic, buying more games online and having them shipped to them, remember Chads don't understand complex digital stores and prefer their CDs.      US Furry Association founder **Ryan Cohen** has a chance to breath life back into this decrepit soul. The last major console war and sale was in Q4 of 2013. Seven years ago. This console upgrade cycle will be the largest since the Xbox One and PS4 came out. Already most major retailers are struggling to accept preordered and they are flying off the shelves. This is free money for **GME.**     In 2013 Q3 **GME** had a revenue of $2.11 billion. The following Q4 2013 had a revenue of  $3.68 billion. This trend stays true every year there is a major increase in next gen console sales. In Q3 2020 **GME** had a revenue of  $1.09 billion, with the prior year Q3 2019 being  $ 1.44 billion . This is within the standard deviation of change, and this is during a pandemic! If the trend stays true revenue is poised to be an increase from Q3 to Q4.       [GME 2013](https://preview.redd.it/l1v9g8n8p5p51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdb51bb40e47850b4fdbc4f24b570849e37c39eb)  Now while this doesn't sound like amazing news and more like autistic general knowledge, that's true. But this combined with the other news may mean something else entirely.      **Ryan Cohen** has connections with many intuitional investors and has just bought a sizeable controlling portion of **GME**. Now many would wonder why someone would waste money on **GME**, the reason is something most autists on Wall St. look over. **CASH BALANCES.** **GME** is ***RICH*** in cash right now. With the majority of the stock market on massive discount and people looking for jobs their $700 million dollar balance of cash holdings is very enticing. **Cohen** has said he wants to turn **GME** into the next **Amazon AMZN.** With the closing of brick and mortar stores and the huge cash balance this leaves **GME** poised for growth. This combined with recent growth and the upcoming console sales will help push **GME** into being a household name again.

This was the Xbox One and PS4 console war, very similar to the console battle going on currently. In this year there was a similar uptick around September, followed by downward movement prior to October/November.   &amp;#x200B;  [GME 2013](https://preview.redd.it/i3z24va5g5p51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c47f7495505707e91e9bdc0882957dc5132dc0)  During this Q4 2013 **GME** had a reported revenue of  3.68 billion. With a prior Q3 2013 revenue of  2.11  Billion. This was a 18.8% increase to the prior year, with no new consoles announced. Now in comparison we have this year Q3 2020 slated with $1.09 billion in revenue. While there are many causations for this decrease in revenue some of the main include: old infrastructure, dying market share, and sweaty neckbeards dying off due to Covid. The greatest reason is due to the pandemic closing down their in person stores, their bread and butter.  **Now** **GME** has had a rough go over the last five years. Closing thousands of brick and mortar stores. Now this looks awful to any investor, and even you autists have probably stayed away from it. *However*, there is a bonus to closing all these stores. **GME** has become ***Cash Rich***. **GME** has over $700 *million* in cash holdings. ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/12/gamestop-is-cash-rich-but-growth-poor/#:\~:text=Financial%20wins&amp;text=GameStop%20counts%20over%20%24700%20million,above%20its%20current%20market%20capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/12/gamestop-is-cash-rich-but-growth-poor/#:~:text=Financial%20wins&amp;text=GameStop%20counts%20over%20%24700%20million,above%20its%20current%20market%20capitalization).).     In addition to this $700 million in cash holdings past trends of **GME** revenue during console war years show the company is essentially given free money by Xbox and PlayStation. People have to buy their refrigerators and routers from someone and since all the major retailers have been selling out so quick in preorders that their sites have been struggling to keep up. ([https://www.tomshardware.com/news/xbox-series-x-name-confusion-amazon](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/xbox-series-x-name-confusion-amazon)). It's going to be a green quarter for **GME**.   &amp;#x200B;  Now then this combined **Ryan Cohen** (remember him? the furry guy) taking a large interest in **GME** can spell for a revival of the household classic game company. With the amount of funds that Cohen can bring in with investors and the amount of cash rich holdings **GME** already has, and the decreasing amount of brick and mortar sales. This leaves **GME** poised to become a competitor to **Amazon** **AMZN** and other online game market places. With the amount of money and know how under Cohen's management I can see an update to the **GME** web store coming in the future and a change in their business model, moving more towards competing with other online retailers and completely dissolving their physical properties. With the upcoming console sales they will see a rise in revenue and stock valuation and this combined with the other news has a good chance of pushing **GME** back into the online retailer space.     **TLDR: GameStop is going to turn into a dog food retailer and turn physical locations into Pet Salons. Also the stock will rocket to the moon because console sales will make the neckbeards and chads come together.**  &amp;#x200B;  News:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/09/24/what-time-gamestop-getting-new-stock-for-ps5--pre-orders-heres-when/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/09/24/what-time-gamestop-getting-new-stock-for-ps5--pre-orders-heres-when/)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1518094|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YM7dsckTkYkqvlpiqlGcTLWutJXMZZ4HoiW37QT0VEw.jpg|65.0|140.0|GameStop and Dog Food DD|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz4rbp/gamestop_and_dog_food_dd/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

Wait for the short squeeze to happen soon, 50$ is highly probable.   For those of you retards who don't know what short squeeze means: normally if you want to short a stock you borrow it (for a fee) and sell to buy back at lower price and make bank. But what happens if the price goes up against you? You not only have to pay the borrow fee as time passes, you also can get margin called and have to buy back the shares at higher prices. Which drives price higher. Which makes more shorters be margin called and buy back shared. Rinse and repeat and watch the price fly to the fucking moon  I believe this is the last change to hop in on the dip.

INTRODUCTION**  * When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn’t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What’s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.  * Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software – under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.  **II. CONSOLES**  * Just to start things off, you have to remember we’re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop’s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).  **III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**  * At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital. * While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn’t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). Expanding into numerous other [categories](https://i.imgur.com/QSkZEAw.png). Nearly 70% of their online orders were fulfilled on the same [day](https://i.imgur.com/NK8lkqD.png) leveraging their wide network of stores, of which they are pruning the excess. Also, Game prices are set to [increase $10](https://technosports.co.in/2020/09/19/sony-confirms-that-ps5-games-will-cost-up-to-69-99/).  * GameStop’s Loyalty Program accounts for over 55M [users](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0). They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry. (*[See the fall of Toys R us and its impact on Mattel/Hasbro](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-toy-category-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-death-of-toys-r-us/571701/); turns out the manufacturers really needed ToysRUs*)  **VI. BALANCE SHEET**  * But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last?  * Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&amp;A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png) * Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)  **V. MAJOR BACKING**  * In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Talsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop’s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?  **VI. THE SHORTS**  * But here is the real kicker. GameStop’s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don’t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).  **VII. CONCLUSION**  * Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they’ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high. * For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work.

Mind you Im new to trading. I've been looking on here and a few other subs (all over the web really) and was taking direct advice and quickly learned - stop that shit.  There's a lot of just ""fun"" on here or whatever and I need no filler, no nonsense news/ tips/ hints. So after learning and adjusting from my loss/es I've learned a few things and this is kind of where I'm at mentally:  * I have to stop panicking and leaving good positions when they go slightly against me and let them play out- if I did proper DD. * Because I have a small account I have to look for trades that will at least play out positively for at least one trading day because I can't exit positions intraday freely as if I'm day trading. * Stick to quality, reputable companies. * I will say even though Im against just following whats posted here this sub does have a knack for mentioning stocks that will move big and keeping a constant flow of key news whether it's breaking last minute news or an event a few weeks out so I'm learning to stay tuned in but play the moments based on my own thoughts.  And that's about it, I don't really know technical analysis and I think that's killing me. I researched MACD, RSI, SMA/ EMA &amp; Bollinger Bands but they're not on RH as futures like on Webull or ToS so I don't use them much. I've been entering stocks late in the pump/moon and catching the ride down, I also lost big playing earnings for either GME or SWBI. I still think earnings are good opportunities I just don't know how to read the situations properly.  Also should I stick with Robinhood or switch brokers. I like it just wish the charting had more features and the 9:30 -10:00 time area were better with filling orders.  That's where I'm at mentally. I think I should take 4- 6 weeks off based off my losses and just learn  and take another stab at it. I was starting to make money but the Labor Day correction shook things up for me.  Any advice, any books I should read, series' I should watch... I'm open to it all, I'm serious about trying to succeed in the market so I'm not giving up but I've lost enough that I'm getting more realistic and learning to respect the ups and downs of the market. I gotta really come up with a game plan to do this.

A couple of big brains said the upcoming consoles are going to save this bankrupt company with targets at $8 and $10 but I am here to shine a light on this run up. First off even with extensive video game sales this company is not appreciating to last years levels. It is already destined to bankrupt so even with a good holiday season what are they going to be able to invest in to protect them from the ebb of the console cycle? Even with strong sales they will probably still lose money at peak revenue!   Second there has been a ton of weird activity at the $15 price target. I would bet this scheme is a plot to pump money into this company to make returns on way OTM options contracts and then to crash it so that they expire worthless.

Since that article, we now know the MM's are creeping wsb for retail info. I dont want them to know a retailers DD on GME. Lets dive in.  Nobody should buy this stock. Its terrible. Going to zero! Im shorting! Big debt, negative EPS. Dont get caught holding the GME bag.  However,  There is a *RISK* the share price could *DOUBLE* before going to zero as the new console cycle will bring lots of FCF to the stores.  We now know that physical game disks will still be in high demand as the digital only console specs are much weaker and have restricted backwards compatibility compared to the disk version console. This will give GME a big boost to revenue when it comes to trade-ins, where their profit margins are highest.  \- They have heavily reduced their SG&amp;A, closing unprofitable stores, restructured debt so they can continue without worry until 2023 if they cant manage to turn things around. Their y/y comps from 2020 -&gt; 2021 should show a huge improvement which the market has not priced in.  \- Recently the chewy founder has taken a 10% stake in GME as they look to transform themselves into an e-commerce business model, launching a new app and possibly turning stores into semi-fulfillment centers/ in store gaming hubs in the near future.  \- The management team has done stock buybacks to reduce outstanding shares from &gt;100M to 65million making the SP more volatile to the upside if MC improves.  \- If GME was to have a market cap of 1Billion which is still quite low (prior console cycle saw GME mrkt cap at +$4b) the share price would need to be $15.  \- Short interest is &gt;100%, so a potential short squeeze would bring us huge *LOSSES*  Dont let the MM's know that the SP could *DOUBLE* in the medium term. They might use that info against our *retail short position*  Ok *RETAILS*, here is our position  Buy puts of any strike at least 2 months out or just short sell.

Thus, in the event of a very bullish news, we would suddenly see a surge of buyers which could trigger one of the greatest short squeezes to have ever existed lasting near 18 days for brokers to make all of their margin calls.  &amp;#x200B;  [5-year Bearish Momentum](https://preview.redd.it/ejxk7qy5rsk51.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dec5d194ea82de79f61f55ca4b86473fe559d73)  GME was trading near $60 5 years ago, but the only path it saw from there on forth was downwards. However, we've seen a 50% growth in the past 3 days and held up pretty strong today despite all the market push-backs. This was one solid uptick due to a famous entrepreneur revealing that he was still hoarding GME stocks and going as far as upping the ante through the purchase of an additional 400k shares.   Now, consider the event of an earnings beat-down on Sept 9 at the closing bell.   Need I say more?  **How I would play this** \- buy up large amounts of shares and hold them until post earnings (but don't throw your entire portfolio into shares. Leave around 5%\~10% as you'll need them to purchase calls). This will keep the demand healthy and of course more people will buy in due to the hype/stock and the potential short squeeze. Don't expect a short squeeze before earnings because likely, there will not be much action from here. Calls aren't even worth it for the run-up due to the high IV on Sept/Oct calls so your returns from your run-up (if it actually does have one) might be marginal than actually buying shares. Finally, on Sept 9 before ER release, throw the 5%\~10% that you had reserved into October calls.   This strategy, in my opinion, is the most conservatively-aggressive, optimally risk hedging approach that would allow you to partake in what could be a max tendie reaping while also, limiting your losses if the short squeeze does not happen.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1456734|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/q_fm8jlNvxbcW_pWLXIXTECn_e9Tt3YdM7-4JiMYfTo.jpg|134.0|140.0|GameStop (GME) - The Last Stand (Short Squeeze Earnings Play 09/09)|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilg6ub/gamestop_gme_the_last_stand_short_squeeze/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||

The same geniuses throwing money at [companies with no revenue](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA), [colors](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL), and [companies whose competitors are giving out their products for free](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM). I'm going to tell you why everyone is buying it and why /u/DeepFuckingValue is going to be a multi-millionaire soon.  ## Short squeeze **GME is one of the most shorted stocks**: 55M of 65M shares are short, including [&gt;100% of float](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). Based on average volume, it would take the over 15 days for all shorts to cover. More than half the shorts entered under $7 and are now taking losses. **A price spike from good news could trigger a [short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze) and force shorts to cover at higher and higher prices**. If only there were good news...  ## Enter Ryan Cohen In 2011, Ryan started competing with Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Costco to sell a commodity. Despite [historic failures by predecessors](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/dotcom-pets-dot-com.asp), he thought he could prevail by focusing on customer service. He ended up selling [his company](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY) for $3B, and now it is worth $27B. Since then, Ryan has been very selective about investments, saying no to [99.9% of opportunities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#63e0b2d25579) and investing only in AAPL, WFC, and... GME?!?  **Last Friday, Ryan filed a [13D](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18181/html) indicating he bought a 9% stake in GME.** The [updated filing](https://newsfilter.io/a/6b966651795e12f76f45b301d8227a7f) shows that he bought 415K shares yesterday, including 100K at $6.726, and now owns a 9.6% stake. He might continue buying, but we won't know until after Q2 earnings next Wednesday. Since the filing, GME is up ~40% and [short borrowing costs have increased from 3.9% to 8.5%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).  But why would he get into GameStop? People are as fanatical about games as they are about pets. He doesn't have to build a company from scratch - he can take the Chewy focus on customer service and Chewify GameStop. He is also joined by James Symancyk, former CEO of PetSmart, who is on the boards of both PetSmart and GameStop.  **Ryan's additional changes the whole trajectory of the company**, no longer with terminal value 0. Don't forget GameStop owns [ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/toys-collectibles/thinkgeek) and has been shifting into toys and collectibles. But even within games there is an upcoming catalyst...  ## New console cycle New hardware is not very profitable for Gamestop, but resales are. A new console cycle means that people will get rid of old consoles via trade-ins, which Gamestop can then sell a healthy margins.  Ryan Cohen is long GME, Michael Burry is long CME, and even [the guy who bashes GameStop on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf1Wt2HEllOSeQzKz2-GNDA) is [long GME](https://stocktwits.com/message/240323066).

Their revenue is declining like crazy and it [kinda looks like ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/stock-comparison?s=gross-profit&amp;axis=single&amp;comp=GME) what happened to Blockbuster.   Why is GameStop trash? Remember when Netflix and other streaming services came out and blockbuster got a shit taken on them? It’s the same situation now, with digital games being much easier to buy and pay for online. And lets face it, people are lazy, especially gamers. Look at the new PS5 and the new XBOX, there’s two options, the digital one, and the one with a disk slot. The one with a disk slot is 50$ more. Who the fuck would pay 50$ just for a disk slot, aight i get it if you wanna keep your old games but honestly I doubt many people will be willing to do so.  Furthermore, GameStop is always diarrhead on by the gaming community on the fact that whenever you want to turn in a game that you played for like 2 months and paid 50$ for they’ll offer you 12$. Fuck that. Gay shit. Theres also waaay more PC players than Console players, who GameStop is targeted at. Well likely see a further decline in console players as they keep getting more expensive and pc part companies are growing like a monkeys dick in a whale enclosure.   Extra professional DD  The other day I went to my local GameStop and there were literally 3 other people in it; the cashier, his homie, and his homies girlfriend.

The problem is that RH won't let you buy back stock with the buying power you get from being assigned since they restrict accounts even if you have enough BP to cover it yourself, so I had to tell (email) them to do it for me manually which really sucked since the stock went back up at open before dropping back down to lows of yesterday and I missed out on some small gains. During the aftermath of the whole beyond meat stock craze, I got assigned on a deep ITM call calendar spread and the stock shot up 25$ bucks on 06/10/2019. if RH would have let me sell I would be up 9K that day and made back all my losses overnight. it seems call get assigned more often than puts for me, idk why but stats say that early exercise of calls doesn't make sense to do unlike for puts but it happens more often tho anyways.

Now remind yourself a bunch of those people work for big hedge funds and big banks because of daddy's connections and the truly worthless go raise funds for charities or something. A guy I know works for JPMorgan and he could be mostly aptly described as a rock eater (well take any anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt but I'm sure I'm not the only one to know a glue sniffer who works on Wall St.)  Some single individuals like Michael Burry (who's now bathing in his pre pump WYNN/LVS/FL calls) are able to beat the market consistently but those people are so fucking rare they generally can't overcome the mass of retards that usually compose the rest of their funds or bank (even then they can be wrong, hello GME). These people represent 0.00001% of institutional investors and most of the time the money they move is not enough to get things going  And that truth is reflected when it's put under the microscope:  '' From January 1994 to October 2018 – through both bull and bear markets – the passive [S&amp;P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) outperformed every major hedge fund strategy by about 2.25 percent in annualized return ''  So stop worrying about ''the rug getting pulled'' in these times because they can't pull the rug on their own. We gotta pull it with them too. We saw that when even big Daddy Buff got out earned by mental retards for 2 months straight. He sure as fuck didn't want to tank that 20% loss on purpose.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.  # **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020. ***** &gt; The Fed’s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there’s a drop in continuing clams, after May’s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs. ***** &gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020. ***** &gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%. ***** &gt; “I think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “With cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody — all facets of the financial markets — are sort of suggesting the same outcome.” ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday. ***** &gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week. ***** &gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists. ***** &gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed. ***** &gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up. ***** &gt; “When GDP is minus 30%, other issues don’t matter. There’s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,” said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. “I think we’ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn’t quite there but I think it’s coming.” ***** &gt; # Fed ahead &gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell. ***** &gt; “Whey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?” Paulsen said. “They’re still going to support the economy. They’re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They’re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.” ***** &gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example. ***** &gt; “We think right now they’re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,” Harris said. ***** &gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. “I think it’s too early for that,” said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control. ***** &gt; “Yield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,” he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases. ***** &gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it’s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. “We’ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,” he said. “In my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.” ***** &gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations. ***** &gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**  *****  # S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets  &gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.  &gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.  &gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!  &gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**  &gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run  &gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**  &gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**  *****  # Big Gains From Smaller Tech  &gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**  &gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the ""Big 5"" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.  &gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the ""big 5"" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the ""big 5"" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).  &gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**  *****  # Best 50-Day Rally Ever  &gt; In many ways, what we’ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.  &gt; “There are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,” exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Here’s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.”  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What’s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.  *****  # 2020 In Charts  &gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we’ve ever seen. “2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.” &gt;  To best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.  &gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn’t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 5.) Mark Twain said “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes”. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don’t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We’ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn’t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$ADBE**  &gt; * **$CHWY**  &gt; * **$TIF**  &gt; * **$LULU**  &gt; * **$COUP**  &gt; * **$SFIX**  &gt; * **$LOVE**  &gt; * **$NEPT**  &gt; * **$GHM**  &gt; * **$REVG**  &gt; * **$GME**  &gt; * **$HDS**  &gt; * **$FIVE**  &gt; * **$SIG**  &gt; * **$CASY**  &gt; * **$CVGW**  &gt; * **$AMC**  &gt; * **$FCEL**  &gt; * **$QTNT**  &gt; * **$PLCE**  &gt; * **$CHS**  &gt; * **$THO**  &gt; * **$GCO**  &gt; * **$BF.B**  &gt; * **$LMNR**  &gt; * **$WSG**  &gt; * **$PRTY**  &gt; * **$GES**  &gt; * **$BBCP**  &gt; * **$CONN**  &gt; * **$HEXO**  &gt; * **$PHR**  &gt; * **$PVH**  &gt; * **$RRGB**  &gt; * **$PLAY**  &gt; * **$TNP**  &gt; * **$JW.A**  &gt; * **$SB**  &gt; * **$GSM**  &gt; * **$SRT**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Adobe Inc. $392.90 &gt; **Adobe Inc.

A lot of you need to sit the fuck down, shut your fucking mouth and listen.

I gave y’all a 150-bagger.    So how could I catch that? Because it wasn't random, yo. And I'm here to teach your asses how to try to spot such potential moves. But first, the technical bootcamp.    &amp;#x200B;  **Chapter III. Mouthbreather's bootcamp on managing a position – THE TECHNICALS**  &amp;#x200B;  **RULE 1. YOU NEVER BUY OPTIONS AT OPEN.** You NEVER OVERPAY for an option. You never FOMO into buying too fast. You NEVER EVER NEVER pump the premium on a play.  I saw you fuckers buying over 4k TQQQ 5/22 $45 puts in the first minutes of trading. You pumped the premium to over $0.50 dudes. The play's never going to work if you do that, because you give the market maker free delta, and he's going to hedge that against you. Let me explain simply:  &amp;#x200B;  Let's say a put on ticker $X at strike $50 is worth $1, and a put at strike $51 is worth $2.   If you all fomo in at once into the same strike, the market maker algos will just pull the asks higher. If you overpay at $2 for the $50p, the market maker will just buy $51ps for $2 and sell you $50ps for 2$. Or he'll buy longer-dated $50ps and sell you shorter-dated $50ps. Max risk for him is now 0, max gain is $1. You just gave him free downside insurance, so of course he's going to start going long. And you just traded against yourself, congrats.  &amp;#x200B;  You need to get in with patience, especially if you see other autists here wanting to go in at the same time. Don't step on each other's toes. You put in an order, and you wait for it to fill for a couple of seconds. If it doesn't fill, AND the price of the option hasn't moved much recently, you can bump the bid $0.01. And you keep doing that a few times. Move your strikes, if needed. Only get a partial fill or don't get a fill at all? You cancel your bid. Don't fucking leave it hanging there, or you're going to put a floor on the price. Let the mm algos chill out and go again later.   &amp;#x200B;  **RULE 2. WATCH THE TIME**. Algos are especially active at x:00, x:02, x:08, x:12, x:30 and x:58. Try not to buy at those times.  **RULE 3. YOU USE MULTIPLE BROKERS.** Don't just roll with Robinhood, you're just gimping yourself. If you don't have another one, open up a tasty, IB, TD, Schwab, whatever. But for cheap faggy puts (or calls), Robinhood is the best. If you want to make a play for which the other side would think ""That's free money!"", Robinhood is the best. Because Citadel will snag that free money shit like no other. Seriously, if you don't have a RH account, open one. It's great for making meme plays.  &amp;#x200B;  **RULE 4. YOU DON'T START A TRADE WITH BIG POSITIONS.** Doesn't matter how big or small your bankroll is. If you go all-in, you're just gambling, and the odds are stacked against you. You need to have extra cash to manage your positions. Which leads to  **RULE 5. MANAGING YOUR WINNERS**: Your position going for you? Good job! Now **POUND THAT SHIT!** And again. Move your strikes to cheaper puts/calls, and pound again. And again. Snowball those gains.      **RULE 6A. POUND THOSE $0.01 PUTS:**    So you bought some puts and they’re going down? Well, the moment they reach $0.01, **YOU POUND THOSE PUTS** (assuming there’s enough time left on them, not shit expiring in 2h). $0.01 puts have amazing risk/return around the time they reach $0.01. This is not as valid for calls. Long explanation why, but the gist of it is this: you know how calls have unlimited upside while puts have limited upside? Well it’s the reverse of that.  **RULE 6B. MANAGING YOUR LOSERS:**   Your position going against you? Do you close the position, take your loss porn and post it on wsb? **WRONG DUMBASS**. You manage that by **POUNDING THAT SHIT**. Again and again. You don't manage losing positions by closing. That removes your gainz when the market turns around. You ever close a position, just to have it turn out it would have been a winner afterwards? Yeah, don't do that. You manage it by opening other positions. Got puts? Buy calls. Got calls? Buy puts. Turn positions into spreads. Buy spreads. Buy the VIX. Sell the VIX. They wanna pin for OPEX? Sell them options. Not enough bankroll to sell naked? Sell spreads. Make them fight you for your money, motherfuckers, don't just give it away for free. When you trade, YOU have the advantage of choosing when and where to engage. The market can only react. That's your edge, so USE IT! Like this:  &amp;#x200B;  Example 1:   Initial TQQQ 5/22 position = $5,000. Starts losing? You pound it.   &amp;#x200B;  ![img](gq938ty8e5151)  Total pounded in 5/22 TQQQ puts = $10,824. Unfortunately expired worthless (but also goes to show I'm not selling you puts, dickwads)  Then the autists show up:  &gt;""Hahaha you lost all your money nice job you fucking idiot why do you even live?"" - /u/cscqb4  Wrong fuckface. You see the max pain at SPX 2975 &amp; OPEX pin coming? Sell them some calls or puts (or spreads).   &amp;#x200B;  ![img](7nv23fr41a151)  Sold 9x5/20 SPX calls@2975, bam +$6,390. Still wanna pin? Well have some 80x5/22 TQQQ $80cs, bam anotha +$14,700.  &amp;#x200B;  ![img](1iqtpmc71a151)  \+$21,090 - $10,824 = +$10,266 =&gt; Turned that shit into a +94.85% gain.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;[./u/cscqb4 rn](https://giphy.com/gifs/smile-angry-kanye-west-ZI88V08ZzgMWA)   &amp;#x200B;  You have a downside position, but market going up or nowhere? You play that as well. At least make some money back, if not profit.   &amp;#x200B;  Example 2:  &amp;#x200B;  5/22, long weekend coming right? So you use your brain &amp; try to predict what could happen over the 3-day weekend. Hmm, 3 day weekend, well you should expect either a shitty theta-burn or maybe the pajama traders will try to pooomp that shite on the low volume. Well make your play. I bet on the shitty theta burn, but could be the other, idk, so make a small play.   &amp;#x200B;  Sold some ES\_F spreads (for those unaware, ES is a 50x multiplier, so 1 SPX = 2 ES = 10 SPY, approximately). -47x 2955/2960 bear call spreads for $2.5. Max gain is $2.5, max loss is 2960-2955 = $5. A double-or-nothing basically. That's $5,875 in premium, max loss = 2x premium = $11,750.   Well, today comes around and futures are pumping. Up to 3,014 now. Do you just roll over? You think I'm gonna sit and take it up the ass? Nah bros that's not how you trade, you fucking fight them. How?  I have:  47x 2960 calls  \-47x 2955 calls  &amp;#x200B;  Pajama traders getting all up in my grill? Well then I buy back 1 of the 2955 calls. Did that shit yesterday when futures were a little over 2980, around 2982-ish. Paid $34.75, initially shorted at $16.95, so booked a -$892 loss, for now. But now what do I have?  &amp;#x200B;  46x 2955/2960 bear calls  1x 2960 long call  &amp;#x200B;  So the fuckers can pump it. In fact, the harder they pump it, the more I make. Each $2.5 move up in the futures covers the max loss for 1 spread. With SPX now at \~3015, that call is $55 ITM. Covers 24/46 contracts rn. If they wanna run it up, at 3070 it's break-even. Over that, it's profit. I'll sell them some bear call spreads over 3050 if they run it there too. They gonna dump it? well under 2960 it's profit time again. They wanna do a shitty pin at 3000 today? Well then I'll sell them some theta there.  Later edit: that was written yesterday. Got out with a loss of only $1.5k out of the max $5,875. Not bad.  And that, my dudes, is how you manage a position.  &amp;#x200B;  **RULE 7 (ESPECIALLY FOR BEARS). YOU DON'T KEEP EXTRA CASH IN YOUR BROKER ACCOUNT.** You don't do it with Robinhood, because it's a shitty dumpsterfire of a broker. But you don't do it with other brokers either. Pull that shit out. Preferably to a bank that doesn't play in the markets either, use a credit union or some shit. Why? Because you're giving the market free liquidity. Free margin loans. Squeeze that shit out, make them work for it. Your individual cash probably doesn't make a dent, but a million autists with an extra $1200 trumpbucks means $1.2b. That's starting to move the needle. You wanna make a play, use instant deposits. And that way you don't lose your shit when your crappy ass broker or bank gets its ass blown up on derivative trades. Even if it's FDIC or SIPC insured, it's gonna take time until you see that money again.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **Chapter IV. BUSTING YOUR RETARDED MYTHS**  &amp;#x200B;  **MYTH 1 - STONKS ONLY GO UP**  &amp;#x200B;  Do you think the market can go up forever? Do you think stOnKs oNLy Go uP because Fed brrr? Do you think SPX will be at 5000 by the end of the month? Do you think $1.5 trillion is a good entry point for stonks like AAPL or MSFT? Do you want to buy garbage like Hertz or American Airlines because it's cheap? Did you buy USO at the bottom and are now proud of yourself for making $2? Well, this section is for you!  Let's clear up the misconception that stonks only go up while Fed brrrs.  &amp;#x200B;  What's your target for the SPX top? Think 3500 by the end of the year? 3500 by September? 4000? 4500? 5000? Doesn't matter, you can plug in your own variables.   &amp;#x200B;  Let's say SPX only goes up, a moderate 0.5% each period as a compounded avg. (i.e. up a bit down a bit whatever, doesn't matter as long as at the end of your period, if you look back and do the math, you'll get that number). Let's call this variable BRRR = 0.005.  &amp;#x200B;  Can you do the basic math to calculate the value at the end of x periods? Or did you drop out in 5th grade? Doesn't matter if not, I'll teach you.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Let's say our period is one week. That is, SPX goes up on average 0.5% each week on Fed BRRR:  2950 \* (1.005\^x), where x is the number of periods (weeks in this case)  &amp;#x200B;  So, after 1 month, you have: 2950 \* (1.005\^4) = 3009  After 2 months: 2950 \* (1.005\^8) = 3070  End of the year? 2950 \* (1.005\^28) = 3392  &amp;#x200B;  Now clearly, we're already at 3015 on the futures, so we're moving way faster than that. More like at a speed of BRRR = 1%/wk  &amp;#x200B;  2950 \* (1.01\^4) = 3069  2950 \* (1.01\^8) = 3194  2950 \* (1.01\^28) = 3897  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Better, but still slower than a lot of permabulls would expect. In fact, some legit fucks are seriously predicting SPX 4000-4500 by September. Like this dude, David Hunter, ""Contrarian Macro Strategist w/40+ years on Wall Street"". IDIOTIC.  [https://twitter.com/DaveHcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448](https://twitter.com/DaveHcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448)  &amp;#x200B;  That'd be 2950 \* (BRRR\^12) = 4000 =&gt; BRRR = 1.0257 and 2950 \* (BRRR\^12) = 4500 =&gt; BRRR = 1.0358, respectively.   &amp;#x200B;  Here's why that can't happen, no matter the amount of FED BRRR: **Leverage. Compounded Leverage.**  &amp;#x200B;  There's currently over $100b in leveraged etfs with a 2.5x avg. leverage. And that's just the ones I managed to tally, there's a lot of dogshit small ones on top of that. TQQQ alone is now at almost $6b in AUM (topped in Fed at a little over $7b).  &amp;#x200B;  Now, let's try to estimate what happens to TQQQ's AUM when BRRR = 1.0257. 3XBRRR = 1.0771. Take it at 3XBRRR = 1.07 to account for slippage in a medium-volatility environment and ignore the fact that the Nasdaq-100 would go up more than SPX anyway.  &amp;#x200B;  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^4) = $7,864,776,060  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^8) = $10,309,100,000  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^12) = $13,513,100,000  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^28) = $39,893,000,000.   &amp;#x200B;  What if BRRR = 1.0358? =&gt; 3XBRR = 1.1074. Take 3XBRRR = 1.10.  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^4) = $8,784,600,000  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^8) = $12,861,500,000  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^12) = $18,830,600,000  $6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^28) = $86,526,000,000  &amp;#x200B;  And this would have to get 3x leveraged every day. And this is just for TQQQ.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's do an estimation for all leveraged funds. $100b AUM, 2.5 avg. leverage factor, BRRR = 1.0257 =&gt; 2.5BRRR = 1.06425  &amp;#x200B;  $100b \* (1.06\^4) = $128.285b  $100b \* (1.06\^8) = $159.385b  $100b \* (1.06\^12) = $201.22b  $100b \* (1.06\^28) = $511.169b  &amp;#x200B;  That'd be $1.25 trillion sloshing around each day. And the market would have to lose each respective amount of cash into these leveraged funds. Think the market can do that? You can play around with your own variables. But understand that this is just a small part of the whole picture, many other factors go into this. It's a way to put a simple upper limit on an assumption, to check if it's reasonable.  &amp;#x200B;  In the long run, it doesn't matter if the Fed goes BRRR, if TQQQ takes in it's share of 3XBRRR. And the Fed can't go 3XBRRR, because then TQQQ would take in 9XBRRR. And on top of this, you have a whole pile of leveraged derivatives on top of these leveraged things. Watch (or rewatch) this: [Selena Gomez &amp; Richard H. Thaler Explaining Synthetic CDO through BLACKJACK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUM59Eh6vTw)   &amp;#x200B;  My general point, at the mouth-breather level, is that Fed BRRR cannot be infinite, because leverage.  And these leveraged ETFs are flawed instruments in the first place. It didn't matter when they started out. TQQQ and SQQQ started out at $8m each. For the banks providing the swaps, for the market providing the futures contracts, whatever counter-party to whatever instrument they would use, that was fine. Because it balanced out. When TQQQ made a million, SQQQ lost a million (minus a small spread, which was the bank's profit). Bank was happy, in the long run things would even out. Slippage and spreads and fees would make them money. But then something happened. Stonks only went up. And leveraged ETFs got bigger and more and more popular.   And so, TQQQ ended up being $6-7b, while SQQQ was at $1b. And the same goes for all the other ETFs. Long leveraged ETF AUM became disproportionate to short AUM. And it matters a whole fucking lot. Because if you think of the casino, TQQQ walks up every day and says ""I'd like to put $18b on red"", while SQQQ walks up and says ""I'd only like to put $3b on black"". And that, in turn, forces the banks providing the swaps to either eat shit with massive losses, or go out and hedge. Probably a mix of both. But it doesn't matter if the banks are hedged, someone else is on the other side of those hedges anyway. Someone's eating a loss. Can think of it as ""The Market"", in general, eating the loss. And there's only so much loss the market can eat before it craps itself.  &amp;#x200B;  If you were a time traveller, how much money do you think you could make by trading derivatives? Do you think you could make $20 trillion? You know the future prices after all... But no, you couldn't. There isn't enough money out there to pay you. So you'd move the markets by blowing them up. Call it the Time-travelling WSB Autist Paradox.   &amp;#x200B;  If you had a bucket with a hole in the bottom, even if you poured an infinite amount of water into it, it would never be full. Because there's a **LIQUIDITY SINK**, just like there is one in the markets.  And that, my mouth-breathing friends, is the reason why FED BRRR cannot be infinite. Or alternatively, ""**STONKS MUST GO BOTH UP AND DOWN**"".  &amp;#x200B;  **MYTH 2 - YOU CAN'T TIME THE MARKET**  &amp;#x200B;  On Jan 14, 2020, I predicted this: Assuming that corona doesn't become a problem, ""AAPL: Jan 28 $328.3, Jan 31 $316.5, April 1 $365.7, May 1 $386, July 1 $429 December 31 $200.""  Now take a look at the AAPL chart in January. After earnings AAPL peaked at $327.85. On 1/31, after the 1st hour of trading, when the big boys make moves, it was at $315.63. Closed 1/31 at $309.51. Ya think I pulled this one out of my ass too?   Yes you can time it. Flows, motherfucker, flows. Money flow moves everything. And these days, we have a whole lot of **RETARDED FLOW**. Can't even call it dumb flow, because it literally doesn't think. Stuff like:  &amp;#x200B;  * ETF flows. If MSFT goes up and AAPL goes down, part of that flow is going to move from AAPL to MSFT. Even if MSFT flash-crashes up to $1000, the ETF will still ""buy"". Because it's passive.  * Option settlement flows. Once options expire, money is going to flow from one side to another, and that my friends is accurately predictable from the data. * Index rebalancing flows * Buyback flows * 401k passive flows * Carry trade flows * Tax day flows * Flows of people front-running the flows  &amp;#x200B;  And many many others. Spot the flow, and you get an edge. How could I predict where AAPL would be after earnings within 50 cents and then reverse down to $316 2 days later? **FLOWS MOTHERFUCKER FLOWS**. The market was so quiet in that period, that is was possible to precisely figure out where it ended up. Why the dump after? Well, AAPL earnings (The 8-K) come out on a Wednesday. The next morning, after market opens the 10-Q comes out. And that 10-Q contains a very important nugget of information: the latest number of outstanding shares.  But AAPL buybacks are regular as fuck. You can predict the outstanding shares before the market gets the 10-Q. And that gives you EDGE. Which leads to  &amp;#x200B;  **MYTH 3 - BUYBACKS DON'T MATTER**   &amp;#x200B;  Are you one of those mouthbreathers that parrots the phrase ""buybacks are just a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders""? Well sit the fuck down, I have news for you. First bit of news, you're dumb as shit. Second bit:  &amp;#x200B;  On 1/28, AAPL's market cap is closing\_price x free\_float\_outstanding\_shares. But that's not the REAL MARKET CAP. Because the number of outstanding shares is OLD AS FUCK. When the latest number comes out, the market cap changes instantly. And ETFs start moving, and hedges start being changed, and so on.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;""But ETFs won't change the number of shares they hold, they will still hold the same % of AAPL in the index"" - /u/random_wsb_autist  &amp;#x200B;  Oh my fucking god you're dumb as fuck. FLOWS change. And the next day, when TQQQ comes by and puts its massive $18b dong on the table, the market will hedge that differently. And THAT CAN BE PREDICTED. That's why AAPL was exactly at $316 1 hour after the market opened on 1/31.   &amp;#x200B;  So, what can you use to spot moves? Let me show you:     Market topped on 2/19. Here’s SPY. I even marked interesting dates for you with vertical lines.  &amp;#x200B;  ![img](7agm171eh5151)  Nobody could have seen it coming, right? WRONG AGAIN. Here:  &amp;#x200B;  ![img](i1kdp3cgh5151)  In fact, JPYUSD gave you two whole days to see it. Those are NOT normal JPYUSD moves. But hey maybe it’s just a fluke?  Wrong again.    &amp;#x200B;  ![img](fsyhenckh5151)  Forex showed you that all over the place. Why? FLOWS MOTHERFUCKER FLOWS. When everything moves like that, it means the market needs CASH. It doesn’t matter why, but remember people pulling cash out of ATMs all over the world?  Companies drawing massive revolvers? Just understand what this flow means.    The reversal:   ![img](4xe97l0oh5151)  ![img](v6i0pdmoh5151)  But it wasn’t just forex. Gold showed it to you as well. Bonds showed it to you as well.  ![img](40j53u8th5151)  Even god damn buttcoin showed it to you.  ![img](43lvafhvh5151)  And they all did it for 2 days before the move hit equities.    &amp;#x200B;   **Chapter V. LIQUIDITY NUKE INBOUND**     You see all these bankruptcies that happened so far, and all the ones that are going to follow? Do you think that’s just dogshit companies and it won’t have major effects on anything outside them? WRONG.  Because there’s a lot of leveraged instruments on top of those equities. When the stock goes to 0, all  those outstanding puts across all expirations get instantly paid.     Understand that Feb-March was a liquidity MOAB. But this will end with a liquidity nuke.    Here’s just HTZ for example: $239,763,550 in outstanding puts. Just on a single dogshit small-cap company (this thing was like $400m mkt. cap last week).  And that’s just the options on the equity. There’s also instruments on etfs that hold HTZ, on the bonds, on the ETFs that hold their bonds, swaps, warrants, whatever. It’s a massive pile of leverage.    Then there’s also the ripple effects. Were you holding a lot of HTZ in your brokerage margin  account? Well guess what big boi, when that gaps to 0 you get a margin call, and then you become a liquidity drain. Holding long calls? 0. Bonds 0. **DOG SHIT!**  And the market instantly goes from holding $x in assets (HTZ equity / bonds / calls) to holding many multiples of x in LIABILITIES (puts gone wrong, margin loans, derivatives books, revolvers, all that crap). And it doesn’t matter if the Fed buys crap like HTZ bonds. You short them some. Because when it hits 0, it’s no longer about supply and demand. You get paid full price, straight from Jerome’s printer. Is the Fed going to buy every blown up derivative too? Because that's what they'd have to do.  Think of liquidity as a car. The faster it goes, the harder it becomes to go even faster. At some point, you can only go faster by driving off a cliff. THE SQUEEZE. But you stop instantly when you hit the ground eventually. And that’s what shit’s doing all over the place right now.  Rewatch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8M)  And just like that fucker, “I’m standing in front of a burning house, and I’m offering you fire insurance on it.”  &amp;#x200B;  **Don’t baghold!**  Now is not the time to baghold junk. Take your cash. Not the time to buy cheap crap. You don’t buy Hertz. You don’t buy USO. You don’t buy airlines, or cruises, or GE, or motherfucking Disney. And if you have it, dump that shit.    And the other dogshit that’s at ATH, congrats you’re in the green. Now you take your profits and fucking dump that shit. I’m talking shit like garbage SaaS, app shit, AI shit, etc. Garbage like MDB, OKTA, SNAP, TWLO, ZM, CHGG etc.  And you dump those garbage ass leveraged ETFs. SQQQ, TQQQ, whatever, they’re all dogshit now.    The leverage MUST unwind. And once that’s done, some of you will no longer be among us if you don’t listen. A lot of leveraged ETFs will be gone. Even some non-leveraged ETFs will be gone. Some brokers will be gone, some market makers will be gone, hell maybe even some big bank has to go under. I can’t know which ones will go poof, but I can guarantee you that some will. Another reason to diversify your shit. There’s a reason papa Warrant Buffet dumped his bags, don’t think you’re smarter than him. He may be senile, but he’s still a snake.  And once the unwind is done, THEN you buy whatever cheap dogshit’s still standing.    Got it? Good.  You feel ready to play yet?  Alright, so you catch a move. Or I post a move and you wanna play it. You put on a small position. When it’s going your way, **YOU POUND DAT SHIT.** Still going?

Use 1/3 of your cash to buy SQQQ 9/18 $5p, pay $0.05. Not more than $0.10.  STEP 4. Use 1/3 of your cash to buy TQQQ 9/18 $20p, pay around $0.45. Alternatively, if you’re feeling adventurous, 7/17 $35p’s for around $0.5.  STEP 5. Use 1/3 of your cash to buy VIX PUT SPREADS 9/15 $21/$20 spread for around $0.15, no more than $0.25. That is, you BUY the 21p and SELL the 20p. Only using Robinhood and don’t have the VIX? What did I just tell you? Well fine, use UVXY then. Just make sure you don’t overpay.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **Chapter VII - Quick hints for non-mouthbreathers**  Quick tips, cuz apparently I'm out of space, there's a 40k character limit on reddit posts.

I'm talking about the company everyone loves to hate, GameStop. I'm pretty new to trading, so I don't have the DD skills of someone who has been here for years, but I do know video games as I collect them pretty heavily.  **Research?**    I sell as well, and I have noticed an insane uptick in costs of games, eBay and local sites have been flooded in the past 2 months with people buying games, as such prices have risen tremendously. Well, do I have any data to back that up? Fuck yes I do, I created a shitty python file about 6 months ago that tracked the prices of games for a given day for about 25 consoles. You can find that here: https://github.com/Cokeroft/pricecharting  The important jist is in the prices folder, find any console you want and look at some prices from pre covid and now. Most notable increases are in Wii, N64, and Gamecube those have been flying off the shelves. If you are able to run it, feel free but you can use the get_any_csv.py file and you can compare, I've done that and here are some examples (CIB) from 120 days ago:  Animal Crossing City Folk $9.99 -&gt; $27.51   Super Mario Galaxy $11.57 -&gt; $18.91   Super Paper Mario $10 -&gt; $19.83   Zelda Skyward Sword $23.77 -&gt; $38.37    **Used Game Sales**    These are the prices for 120 days ago, now if you compare to 10~ days ago, when states starting reopening... prices are now stagnant or decreasing. Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 both dropped 7% in the last 10 days, and most other titles did the same. I'm think we are leaving the apex of used game buying from people on eBay and other sites to endure this pandemic. The states are reopening and people will soon be looking to get out of these purchases.  $GME no longer reports used games sales, but the last time they did they had a 42.7% gross margin on used game sales vs the 23% gross margin on new video games. I would wager it's still around there, maybe closer to 40% because they have gotten a lot of exclusive licenses the last few years. Anyways, I think in the next couple of weeks/months we are going to see a very large influx of people trying to get rid of these games and consoles, and as I said they are more inclined to bring to gamestop than a mom and pop game store. The barrier of entry in eBay pushes a lot of people away (as an eBay seller I hear this all the time) and these people are going to consider the loss worth it because they got their entertainment out of it during the pandemic. So Gamestop will offer them 10% of what they paid, and they will take it because they give zero fucks.  Unfortunately, I do not track volume of sales I perhaps should do that in the future. But I can attest to the volume actually increasing, and these are out of print games, these are just leaving hands of consumers to consumers. I've also been to several game stores in the last month and they almost all are low on inventory. Games of note do not last more than a day, and even random shit ones are popping in price.  **Positions / Ideas** Since this is currently about to happen, and Gamestop is a fucking dumpster fire of a company, I'm not looking for any options for this year. The earliest I would take is the 1/15/21 $5c. I think there is pretty good upside there and it's really the only one with decent volume, even though the IV is trash. I'm personally going to wait to see if it drops more in the next week or two, and snatch a handful.  Anyone maybe more technical able to see if there is anything here? I'm basing this solely on the fact that used game trade ins are going to spike dramatically, which will in turn make their inventory increase and sales would come (as long as Gamestop is still in business by then). I don't have anything in regards to them actually selling the games, so maybe that will shoot this in the foot. Anyways looking for some ideas on how retarded I have become|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1218538|public|confidence|self|||$GME Long Calls Potential|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grbmju/gme_long_calls_potential/|all_ads|6.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'qrMxB0qdtbOPKnwOhze9PxdbeNZQIoH2Dix_FMtpzmM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 192, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b9X7WI7ltLXT3Fk_a_EF1oTDVzbAs-UjdGcZWKaY9Mw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33712b27e5dafeba62de3b97db7f30401d75dc12', 'width': 108}, {'height': 384, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b9X7WI7ltLXT3Fk_a_EF1oTDVzbAs-UjdGcZWKaY9Mw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6b188a5ae63fd394b81c61bdbe3efd419c7dfc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 569, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b9X7WI7ltLXT3Fk_a_EF1oTDVzbAs-UjdGcZWKaY9Mw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317cbfeaaf1b46b70c0fb6e90527fe5923d2258f', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b9X7WI7ltLXT3Fk_a_EF1oTDVzbAs-UjdGcZWKaY9Mw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=20f1509ad90d4a467030cfc835a1bbd435c2a355', 'width': 539}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||

I'll see you again, either on the moon or in the earth core.

Ironic that i made a post on WSB about selling options now that IV is so high and the market dropped.  Not gonna lie seeing all these people becoming rich made my mouth water and thats how i got some fomo, but; i dont want to sound like I'm making excuses or taking fake merits, I knew the market would crash, I live in Italy and the first day that a news came out about the first coronavirus patient in Italy I knew it was gonna be big and the market would get rekt, the Italian one so EWI puts not SPY but still, I was sitting at a restaurant with my father and he told me this news, and I said to YOLO all our money on puts bc its was almost sure the make money, and I meant it, but he wouldn't listen, he didn't even know what I was talking about, plus ALL our money on a BET? no. But that one wouldn't have been a gamble, it was a very good kind of high probability speculation that would have had magnificent gains. But I let it slip, my fault for not pushing harder for it, then we had problems charging thr account, so I just let it go and came back 2 weeks later with all that FOMO to ruin my account.

E) GME was running sales from their online portal and allowed pickups of orders from their stores (only pickups no entry to buy).  F)  In late 2019, Michael Burry’s hedge fund bought 3% of **GME.** In fact, it’s his largest position in the fund, allocating 17.3% in **GME.**   He continues to be a bull.  G)  GameStop said it has been able to reduce debt by $401 million under its ""Reboot"" strategic initiative, which is aimed at optimizing the core business. It also claimed to have exited 2019 with about $500 million in cash and to have cut down selling, general and administrative expenses by $130.4 million.   Cons:  A) You can buy video games at so many places now - Target, Walmart, Best Buy, digital downloads from the publisher, etc.  B)   Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital are activist investors and fighting to put their own board picks for the annual meeting schedule on 6/12/20.  GME has responded by sending out letters to their shareholders urging them to vote for their own picks.  Regardless uncertainty continues to be a pressure point for them going ahead.  Reminds me of the HOG (many autist bears like myself got smoked on that trade) activist shareholder battle which was ultimately resolved ahead of earnings.  I don't see GME resolving anything before earnings but it could do so before the June 12 meeting.

Some may have reopened in states that lift ed restrictions but foot traffic is probably low.  D) Accounting officer resigned recently (claimed it was for personal reasons) but people are skeptical.  E) IV is ridiculously high for options. even same week like this week options.  Maybe better to play this buying the stock outright and riding it much like bargain shoppers on r/Investing are buying Macy's stock.  BUT the IV for LEAPS is more reasonable ( by GME standards) and there is actually some decent volume on them. See the Jan 21/5c's.    TLDR: Buy GME LEAP calls. The proxy fight and other uncertainties should be resolved by the next meeting but don't count on it.  Instead buy yourself some time by going all the way out even if u have to sacrifice to Theta gang."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1208254|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/N0RD2kKKOj4LgYopeGwbrS29UmVZxlt5ZqcBZAl7Azk.jpg|71.0|140.0|Gamestop Earnings 5/28|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnilur/gamestop_earnings_528/|all_ads|6.0||||||||||||

[week long chart](https://imgur.com/lVjg9h7) shows pretty heavy bear signals.   [month long chart](https://imgur.com/YCQRwI4) shows even harder bear signals.

Daily charts have shown massive pushback at $6 and it’s been unable to break that number long enough to show up on anything other than minute charts. And today it’s proved it isn’t willing to push highs that were already established days passed.  Assuming I’m 3 for 3 and right on it falling, what should the plays be? I’m rolling with 5/1 $6p, but you could still buy $5.50p and you’d most likely be in the money.   As for when to sell in case you want to take profits and run, I’d sell exactly at $4.60. Any further and it’s uncharted territory. The rally for the past 2 weeks was simply because Michael fucking Burry (yes the one and only) bought 5% of the company and you autists decided to follow and pump it up. I imagine the price could drop much further than $4.60, but it’s shown support at $4.70ish and who know what’ll happen after it hits that.

The launch of a major gaming system only comes around every 7 years (PS3 in 2006, PS4 in 2013, PS5 in 2020).   PS5 will more than likely be available for the 2020 holiday season with mass production starting in June:  [https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html)   According to this bloomberg article ""Sony remains unlikely to delay the launch of the PS5 from the critical year-end shopping season. So long as archrival Microsoft Corp. doesn’t push back the release of its next-generation Xbox, also expected at the end of the year, Sony won’t delay either"" : [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year)   With Covid potentially affecting this date Jan 2022 $5 calls seem like a safer option - this will give 2 holiday seasons for console sales to increase as some people will get it right on release and then a bunch more the next holiday season (usually when bundles are released at somewhat of a discounted price).

I personally was expecting that Gamespot would benefit by increasing sales over the short term and gaining new customers over the long run.  I fit that demographic, I haven’t play video games in over a decade, but decided to get an xbox to kill some time. Instead of buying from God Bezos, I decided to give GME a chance and do some DD in the process...  The result ... GME is shitting the bed, I made an order to be picked up at store, I went the next day and the store clerk couldn’t find my order (despite me receiving confirmation via email and my credit card being charged), keep in mind, they had everything that I order in the store, they just couldn’t find my order in the system.  The clerk then told me that this has been happening a lot and that the GME IT system has been crashing and dropping “orders”, he told me that I should contact customer service, but after calling and spending two hours (literally) in the phone waiting and listening to elevator music, I have yet to be able to get a hold of anyone that can help me.  What does that means for the company? —&gt; GME might be able to see some increase in revenue over the short term due to all the bored people, but will likely fail to capitalize in turning new sales into loyal recurring customers.    TL/DR: Due to tech issues Gamespot is failing to full-fill online orders, and pissing off customers.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1144802|public|confidence|self|||Gamespot shitting the bed|0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8mw50/gamespot_shitting_the_bed/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||
