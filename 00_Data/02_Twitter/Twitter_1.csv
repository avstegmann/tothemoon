Because by the time GameStop announces the PS5 is in stock, and you see the announcement, it's sold out.  So pro-tip if you want a PS5:  Check Sony Direct constantly.

1378307849760165888 2021-04-03 13:26:13 +0200 <Pendragonfruit> @NinWire Gamestop never stopped selling it.  They are selling the physical copies until they are out of stock.  That is per the Nintendo Rep and per Gamestop manager in my area.  Digital copies were pulled early by Nintendo, but physical will be around until they're gone.
1378307821796651009 2021-04-03 13:26:07 +0200 <idonthaveadoor> @ano10110 Doge was what got me into crypto. I will forever be in debt to Doge and so should all of us. GameStop then doge.
