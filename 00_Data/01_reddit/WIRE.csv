We were true Autists back then!**  **ANYWAY... **  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html  **ABOUT THE COMPANY**  Ticker : $ABCL  Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours)   Market Cap : $6.29 Billion   $ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020.   AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.  Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company’s platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.  **PETER THIEL JOINS AS A BOARD OF DIRECTOR AT ABCELLERA**  https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/peter-thiel-joins-abcelleras-board-of-directors  “AbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what’s possible,” said Mr. Thiel.  I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR!    **COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**  https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19  Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.  The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19.   **SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB **  Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19   https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-announces-agreement-us-government-supply-300000-vials  Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government  https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO  The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.  (The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/world/bamlanivimab-etesevimab-eli-lilly-monoclonal-antibodies.amp.html   **U.S. Halts Distribution of Lilly’s Bamlanivimab Monotherapy, Citing SARS-CoV-2 Variant Resistance**  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.genengnews.com/news/u-s-halts-distribution-of-lillys-bamlanivimab-monotherapy-citing-sars-cov-2-variant-resistance/amp/  But with the arrival of recent variants like the South African one and the UK variant, Bamlanivimab seems to no longer work effectively but AbCellera and Eli Lilly has found a solution to the problem.    **ABCELLERA AND ELI LILLY SOLVES THE VARIANT ISSUE BY COMBINING BAMLANIVIMAB AND ETESEVIMAB**  https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-bamlanivimab-and-etesevimab-together-reduced  New data show therapy reduced risk of hospitalizations and death by 87 percent - Second positive Phase 3 trial readout for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together - Results support use of bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1400 mg, the dose authorized in U.S. and several countries around the world   **EARNINGS REPORT 2020 AND GUIDANCE FOR 2021**  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html  # Strong financial performance led by $233 million in total revenue, including $213 million in milestones and royalties.  # Generated $119 million in net earnings, up from a $2 million loss in 2019  # Expanded partnership business to 103 cumulative programs under contract with 27 partners generating $20 million in research fees (71% growth over $12 million in 2019).  # $594 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $212 million in accrued accounts receivable.  # **Expecting Approx $190 - $220 mil in Q1**  # **Have plenty of high profile projects with Regereron, Kodak, Abdera, Invetx, Lgm, etc..**  # **Project 1404 - Collaboration with Eli Lilly - They said with their research this was the best antibody for Covid-19 in the Market.

We saw this in 2012 and have a proven record of calling out stock promotions in these sectors, namely* [*Liquidmetal Technologies*](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprucepointcap.com%2Fliquidmetals%2F&amp;esheet=52393459&amp;newsitemid=20210310005665&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Liquidmetal+Technologies&amp;index=5&amp;md5=43166067031d8e9e41dbc62502038a2a) *(OTCBB: LQMT) and* [*US Antimony*](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprucepointcap.com%2Funited-states-antimony-corp%2F&amp;esheet=52393459&amp;newsitemid=20210310005665&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=US+Antimony&amp;index=6&amp;md5=c523c7ea845b12f4e415ed07d1bd902d) *(AMEX: UAMY). We see extreme parallels between these promoted failures and American Battery Metals Corp. and Comstock Mining Inc. These companies appear to have hitched their wagon to investor enthusiasm for electric vehicle battery recycling, and their prospective plant’s proximity to Tesla and its Gigafactory in Nevada. We recommend investors exercise extreme caution at these extended valuations and urge shareholders to closely examine why we believe both companies are Strong Sells.”*  \*\*\*  **Spruce Point Report Overview**  We urge investors to review key findings in Spruce Point’s report and hold management accountable for answers to the following issues:  * **We believe optimistic claims for near-term revenues and profits from electric vehicle (“EV”) battery recycling are likely to disappoint long after insiders sell out and share prices correct.** After speaking with a renowned expert, we believe the EV battery recycling market will be slow to develop. There’s no existing infrastructure to recycle lithium-ion batteries, only a fraction of EVs are nearing end-of-life, most batteries are repurposed for other applications rather than recycled, and recycling is not currently economical as most key battery materials are not currently in short supply. ABML is making claims it can achieve $200 million of revenue and 78% net margin, while LODE is claiming $100 million of sale and $30 million of profit potential within three years. Our report dissects why investors should be incredibly skeptical of these claims given neither company has outlined exactly where the battery supply will come from, and who the customers will be. In addition, we believe neither management team has any prior experience in the battery recycling industry and is currently relying on recycling processes that have not been proven at commercial scale. In addition, a host of other environmental and regulatory permitting and approvals remain to be addressed. * **A recent Freedom of Information (“FOIA”) request made in Fernley, Nevada contradicts management’s permitting claims.** To date, ABML has made a purchase of land in Fernley, but has been slowly walking back its timeline to have a fully operational battery recycling facility. Management recently said it is finalizing its permitting process with the city and that permits are in process. Yet, the City of Fernley, Nevada affirmatively stated that no applications or permits have been submitted to date on the parcel of land owned by ABML. ABML is still in the land entitlement phase. * **We believe both management teams are promotional and have a demonstrated track record of failing investors’ expectations in past business ventures.** ABML’s CEO Doug Cole and Director Doug MacLellan have failed to disclose on their respective biographies associations with numerous failed business ventures. Most alarming, CEO Cole was a Director at Longwei Petroleum, an SEC-charged fraud, while Director MacLellan was Vice Chairman at AXM Pharma, a company the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order for financial reporting fraud. Investors should also be alarmed that ABML is using an increasing number of Investor Relations and Consulting firms to promote its story. We believe that not all of these consulting arrangements have been properly disclosed. With respect to LODE, we believe it failed on its gold and silver mining objectives. Investors should be aware that in 10 years as CEO, Corrado de Gasperis has raised $176 million of capital and accumulated $114 million of negative Free Cash Flow. In 2020, ahead of its claims to transition to a “green metal company” and the formation of LiNiCo, we believe red flags such as special bonuses to the CEO, a financial misstatement and identification of a material weakness, auditor dismissal, and a CFO resignation have emerged. * **Conflicts of interest and limited management engagement.** Many of ABML’s executives have other business interests that we believe distract from the attention ABML requires. Most notably, we are concerned by ABML’s Chief Resource Officer Scott Jolcover, who is also a “consultant” to LODE and manages “all commercial transactions.” This is concerning given that LODE’s formation of LiNiCo places it in direct competition with ABML’s battery recycling ambitions. It should be noted that we believe Scott Jolcover is related to Jeffrey Jolcover, who was convicted of securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering. A local source in Nevada stated that Jeffrey Jolcover works with LODE’s largest shareholder, John Winfield, at D.W.C."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9487283.0|public|confidence|self|Spruce Point Capital Management Announces Investment Opinion|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m208ku/spruce_point_capital_management_announces/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-03-10|WIRE

Today we know I was right. The earnings were insane, crushed all estimates, and at time of writing the stock sits up \[13%\]. To those apes that still haven’t heard of UNFI, go to your fridge and open the door. Yeah that’s right, everything in there has been supplied by UNFI. They are the largest grocery supplier in the US that got into a tiff with Goldman Sachs who’s been [shitting](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Goldman+Sachs+Assumes+United+Natural+Foods+%28UNFI%29%2C+Downgrades+to+Sell/14756432.html) on them since 2018 and they [sued](https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/unfi-sues-goldman-sachs-over-supervalu-deal) in 2019. You can read more about that bullshit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lig4v4/omg_goldman_sachs_lowers_rating_of_a_stock_that/). Basically if you have a fridge, and that fridge has food, then UNFI has your money.   **Q2 Earnings Highlights**  Let's go over the insane earnings they just reported:  1. **Adjusted EPS of $1.25, a 400% increase**  2. **Adjusted EBITDA** of $206 million, a 57.3% increase  3. **Net income** of $59 million, an increase of $90 million  4. **Net sales** increased 7.1% to $6.89 billion  5. **Net Debt of 2.49 billion,** a decrease of $242 million driven by $265 million in cash provided by operations  6. Bringing **BC** services into their services portfolio!  [Q2 highlights](https://preview.redd.it/kgq1orius7m61.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4303571ee66e6fabc098b20ed227794f63fbe0cf)  Earnings details in 8K filing [here](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001020859/2cabd6ad-aebf-4220-81fa-4e7474fcd464.pdf).   **So what happens next? Grocery is sexy (**🍆and🍑**), because Amazon said so**  Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh.   There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are already in development. “Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.  “H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”  Based on the latest 10-K, UNFI has been the distributor to Whole Foods for more than twenty years. Under the terms of their agreement with Whole Foods, they are the primary distributor in all its regions in the United States. Whole Foods is also the only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020.

The entire business is basically selling for what’s on the balance sheet despite growing revenues and earnings. If that’s not deep fucking value, I don’t know what is. If UNFI joined its peers at the 7B+ market cap level, that’s a $130+ stock price. UNFI used to be in the $40s in 2018 and hit an all-time-high of $80 back when its revenue was only 8B in 2015. Now revenues are 3x higher, but the stock is 3x lower, go figure.   **Three** **Major Catalysts to Note**  Fatal blows to the shorts. Be it the announcement of:  ~~·~~ **~~Amazon Deal~~** ~~– to be the exclusive supplier to all Whole Foods locations~~ Announced March 4, 2021  · **Property Sales** – their retail business (Cub Foods) or unused real estate (underutilized distribution centers) to strengthen balance sheet and pay off more debt  · **New hotshot CEO** – they confirmed that current CEO will be retiring but extended timeline for new CEO search  If you’ve gotten this far then congrats you are now a UNFI expert and know that this is a medium to long term play (1 year) with some squeeze potential given the large short %. Trading at around $30, with the massive market potential for grocery this year and the deep value compared to other food distributors, I can see UNFI hitting $80 or about 4B market cap sometime in 2021.   **My advice? Go eat some groceries because you’re skin and bones. Also I like tendies and UNFI literally supplies them.** 🚀 🍆 🚀 🍆 🚀  Disclosure: If you hate money and hate food, then this is not the stock for you.

But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.  Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.  Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.

""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""  He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.  Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?  Why am I breathing hard?  I just got done moving some goalposts.  What might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.  This shit is wild.

The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one. 2. Tesla has massive brand awareness. 3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \* 4. Affordability is coming.\* 5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \* 6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \* 7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*  We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.  The B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.  Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.  Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.

""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""  He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.   Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?  To move some goal posts what might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.

No one knows about this company and are about to miss out on a rocket. I'm all in on this stock. I can't use both DD and Yolo at the same time but YOLO. Some proof below that I BELIEVE  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/a9h3i7o24ul61.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf084bccbbf9764bbace34b5850ede425bde8848  Spectrum Global Solutions INC (SGSI)  **Spectrum Global Solutions INC (SGSI)**  Another awesome penny stock I came across today that is getting very little attention. These penny stock GEMS are great finds for those who find them early. The more I read about this company the more I’m getting excited for what’s to come. This stock is going places and they are taking their share price up with them. If there's a stock out there where you can put Rockets next to the ticker, this is definitely one of those stocks.  Currently has about 2k watchers on StockTwits. The stock is currently trading at 0.48c and I believe it has the potential to grow substantially from this price. Everyone loves a low float stock because once they get the volume they fly high, and this stock is definitely one of those low float stock and has only 15.4 million shares outstanding.  Spectrum Global Solutions is the holding company for next-generation technology companies specialising in telecommunications across the globe. They currently have 5 holdings and are looking to add another company after announcing a definitive agreement to merge with High Wire Networks. This is huge news! And hardly anyone knows about it. I believe this stock is very under-valued and once it gets the attention it deserves the price of the stock will move quickly.  The merger will be accomplished through an exchange of stock and cash. Spectrum intends to file for a name change to High Wire Networks, as it continues to work towards its goal of up-listing to the NASDAQ, subject to satisfaction of the listing qualifications.

Merging with High Wire Networks is a massive bonus for the company and will increase its value 10 fold. Spectrum Global Solutions has a global presence that allows and will continue to allow them to reach global markets and clients. Their potential for growth is limitless. Their stock for investors at the moment is very attractive with the low outstanding shares and float. With volume, this stock will increase dramatically in my opinion. Although their revenue is something that needs improvement, as I mentioned with the global presence this is something that can be achieved. This merger will bring a new board of management that can steer this company in the right direction to achieve those revenue targets.  **High Wire Networks** is a fantastic company that is well established and is producing revenue of 18 million dollars annually and has just been awarded a 2.8 million dollars contract to add to its current revenue. The board of management will take over the management of Spectrum Global Solutions and rebrand the company. As High Wire Networks is in the Cyber Security business, cybersecurity has a 66 billion dollar market size, thus giving the company a lot of room to grow.

In order for them to list on the NASDAQ they have to reach a minimum of a $3 bid price. With how strong these companies look, and with the merger, this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal, **with ease**.

like to talk to you guys about a little company I refer to as ""The T"".  The T or AT&amp;T might not seem that interesting at first glance. It looks pretty boomer to be honest, and it's hardly moved in the past 10 years. My argument to you is that this is going to change and do so quickly.  My rationale for a long position in The T is simple, I think we are looking at the next Disney. I think one of the biggest future streaming platforms is likely to be HBO Max. HBO Max is currently owned by you guessed it The T.  Before I get into the numbers I want to take a moment and give you some of the Intellectual Property currently owned by The T.  · All of HBO (Game of Thrones, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Westworld, Sopranos, The Wire, and more)  · All of Turner Broadcasting IP (This includes TNT, TBS, CN/\[adult swim\], and TruTV)  · All of DC (Batman, Superman, Watchmen, Aquaman and more)  · Currently planned for development on the HBO max platform is a new season of Game of Thrones, The Boondocks, New DC content including Static Shock, a Venture Bro's special, as well as transitioning Rick and Morty to HBO Max exclusive.  Now for the math behind my decision.  Looking at the fundamentals of The T should surprise you. With a market cap of 204.44b it's valued 25% lower than competitor Netflix while maintaining a P/E of 9. By comparison Netflix's P/E is over 80 implying The T should be almost NINE TIMES what it is now if we were valuing it the same as Netflix.  Dis which comes in at a whopping 93 P/E ratio while offering similar services to The T. While Disney might have more IP at the moment if The T continues to merge with company's it can easily compete. One potential target may be Viacom who own many shows that are popular.  If the T were to sit at a P/E Ratio of even just 20 it would be 63.5$ per share a jump of over 100%. The big catalyst will be an increase in HBO Max subscriptions and an expansion of 5G networks.  I personally believe the upside of The T may be around 75% or more over the next 12 months. A huge event being overlooked is the release of the Boondocks new series. One of the most popular series in \[adult swim\] history we can expect this to be a catalyst for growth in HBO Max activations.  Right now The T is on discount I believe and intend on trying to take full advantage of the situation picking up as many shares as I can.  I could talk more maybe about 5G or other lanes of The T's business, but I'll save that for later. For the moment I am focused on one thing and that is streaming as a possible area of significant growth in this company. Perhaps even a trigger of momentum status over the next 24 months."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9318651.0|public|confidence|self|DD For Men With Low T|3.0|[]|0.81|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls6alg/dd_for_men_with_low_t/|some_ads|7.0||||1614259443.0||||||||||||||||||2021-02-25|WIRE

It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.  The fact that GME’s volume could approach the volume of AAPL – a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent “meme stock” which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r/wallstreetbets bulletin board.  #### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes  The GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow.   While this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We’ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.  #### Regulators Will Need to Step In  We have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven’t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if “meme trading” is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions – a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday’s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions – a much larger and more important business – is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a “brownout” event – much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.  The events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.  #### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play  At this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current  versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the “meme stock” security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows.   If a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.  #### Anathema to Free Markets  This is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.  The current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.   [www.60secondinvestor.com](https://www.60secondinvestor.com)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9316483.0|public|confidence|self|Can GameStop Destabilize the Entire Market?|1.0|[]|0.4|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3be8/can_gamestop_destabilize_the_entire_market/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-25|WIRE

These penny stock GEMS are great finds for those who find them early. The more I read about this company the more I’m getting excited for what’s to come. This stock is going places and they are taking their share price up with them. If there's a stock out there where you can put Rockets next to the ticker, this is definitely one of those stocks.  Currently has less than 600 watchers on StockTwits and traded just 1 million shares on Weds 17/02/2021. The stock is currently trading at 0.35c and I believe it has the potential to grow substantially from this price. Everyone loves a low float stock because once they get the volume they fly high, and this stock is definitely one of those low float stock and has only 15.4 million shares outstanding.  Spectrum Global Solutions is the holding company for next-generation technology companies specialising in telecommunications across the globe. They currently have 5 holdings and are looking to add another company after announcing a definitive agreement to merge with High Wire Networks. This is huge news! And hardly anyone knows about it. I believe this stock is very under-valued and once it gets the attention it deserves the price of the stock will move quickly.  The merger will be accomplished through an exchange of stock and cash. Spectrum intends to file for a name change to High Wire Networks, as it continues to work towards its goal of up-listing to the NASDAQ, subject to satisfaction of the listing qualifications.

These penny stock GEMS are great finds for those who find them early. The more I read about this company the more I’m getting excited for what’s to come. This stock is going places and they are taking their share price up with them. If there's a stock out there where you can put Rockets next to the ticker, this is definitely one of those stocks.  Currently has less than 600 watchers on StockTwits and traded just 1 million shares on Weds 17/02/2021. The stock is currently trading at 0.35c and I believe it has the potential to grow substantially from this price. Everyone loves a low float stock because once they get the volume they fly high, and this stock is definitely one of those low float stock and has only 15.4 million shares outstanding.  Spectrum Global Solutions is the holding company for next-generation technology companies specialising in telecommunications across the globe. They currently have 5 holdings and are looking to add another company after announcing a definitive agreement to merge with High Wire Networks. This is huge news! And hardly anyone knows about it. I believe this stock is very under-valued and once it gets the attention it deserves the price of the stock will move quickly.  The merger will be accomplished through an exchange of stock and cash. Spectrum intends to file for a name change to High Wire Networks, as it continues to work towards its goal of up-listing to the NASDAQ, subject to satisfaction of the listing qualifications.

In order for them to list on the NASDAQ they have to reach a minimum of a $3 bid price. With how strong these companies look, and with the merger, this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal, **with ease**. Therefore, I believe this ticker is a strong buy at 0.35 and I believe my PT’s (low: $3, Medium $4.50, High $6) are justified from all of the above mentioned.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9161396.0|public|confidence|self|SGSI looking mad SeGSI|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lntu4g/sgsi_looking_mad_segsi/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-19|WIRE

DD on PyroGenesis Canada Inc. $PYRNF  This is my first DD for a stock discussion board on Reddit. So take it easy.  **PyroGenesis Canada Inc (PYRNF)** is a company that is the leader in the design, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of advanced plasma processes. Yep, straight from their Company Overview. I'm going to detail just a few of their disciplines that really excite me about this companies future.   **Waste-To-Energy (PRRS)**  This company has developed a process for disposing of industrial waste (hazardous, biomedical, etc) using their in house plasma technologies. As a bi-product of these processes they can harness clean energy in the form of electricity, steam, and liquid fuels. This is exciting because not only does it bode well in a Clean Energy movement like we are seeing, but it actually solves a big problem with industrial waste and turns into a useful resource.   **Plasma Atomized Metal Powders**  Now this is where I see a lot of growth potential moving forward with this company. PyroGenesis has invented its own process for creating atomized spherical metal powders. Yep, that sounds complex, because it is. They feed wire strands of various metals into their ""Plasma Atomization"" machine which breaks the metal down into **uniform** spherical metal dust particles. Emphasis on uniform, this means they can control the size of the particles which could meet virtually unlimited customer needs. This is game changing in the era that we are entering where 3D-Printing, and scalability of mass production will rule.  **Potential Catalysts**  * For all of you Cathie Wood fans out there, ARK has recently added this company in their ARK PRNT fund with a current cost-basis of $3.71. This stock closed around 4$ today so it seems like a good early entry time to me. * The company just filed with the SEC to be listed on the NASDAQ. They currently trade on the OTC and the Toronto Stock Exchange. This is big for a couple reasons. First off, it shows the company is checking off a lot of boxes that the NASDAQ requires for listing. Second, and more importantly IMO, one of the main reasons this company wants to be traded on the NASDAQ is to allow more institutions and ETFs to invest. A lot of companies have restrictions against owning OTC stocks. * The company recently filed an NCIB request for 5 million shares over the course of 2021. This is a Canadian process for Stock-Buyback. This could mean a few things. They could be confident in their growth of 202. They could also be looking out for their investors and want their share prices to increase to reward loyal shareholders. In either case, this is a bullish sign for an investor.  **Summary**  I think PyroGenesis Canada has an extraordinary growth potential for 2021 and beyond. Fundamentally they are crushing quarterly earnings (Q4 2020 revenue estimated to be up 367% from Q4 2019), they have an amazing business model that supports clean energy, safer waste disposal, and supplies a massive potential market for Atomized Metallic Particles. They have a thumbs up from Cathie Wood (so if that matters to you then cha ching).   I (a random Reddit investor) am very bullish on this companies outlook. I hope reading this long DD wasn't to painful. See you guys/girls on the moon."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9155781.0|public|confidence|self|Pyrogenesis(PYRNF)|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnmj61/pyrogenesispyrnf/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-19|WIRE

(“Tilray” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TLRY), a global pioneer in cannabis research, cultivation, production and distribution, today reported financial results for the full fiscal year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. All financial information in this press release is reported in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.  Brendan Kennedy, Tilray’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Over the course of 2020, and despite COVID-19 related challenges, we transformed and strengthened Tilray, delivered solid full year results, significantly reduced net loss, and achieved our stated goal of delivering break even or positive Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2020. We did so by generating meaningful revenue growth across our core businesses, particularly international medical and Canadian adult-use in Q4, and reducing costs by $57 million on an annualized basis compared to Q4 of 2019. As a result, we now operate with a more focused, efficient and competitive cost structure. We also strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Tilray for growth and success in the future in combination with Aphria. These results required hard work and dedication and I sincerely appreciate everything the Tilray team has done to transform our business during 2020. We now look forward to the beginning of the next chapter in our corporate journey.”  Mr. Kennedy continued, “Amid an acceleration of regulatory changes and an increasingly-favorable political environment, our proposed merger with Aphria will position the combined company as a global leader with lowest cost of production, leading brands, a well-developed distribution network, and unique partnerships. Finally, and as previously stated, the ‘new’ Tilray will achieve over C$100 million in anticipated pre-tax synergies. The aggregate impact of these value drivers provides confidence that the ‘new’ Tilray will generate significant value for stockholders.”  As announced on December 16, 2020, Tilray will combine businesses with Aphria Inc. and create the world’s largest global cannabis company based on pro forma revenue. Following the close of this transaction, which is expected in the second quarter of 2021, the combined company will operate under the Tilray corporate name with shares trading on Nasdaq under ticker symbol “TLRY”. Completion of the business combination is subject to regulatory and court approvals and other customary closing conditions, including the approval of Tilray and Aphria stockholders.  Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Highlights  Total revenue increased to $56.6 (C$74.4) million, up 20.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Cannabis segment revenue increased 46% to $41.2 million (C$53.6 million), mainly driven by acceleration of International Medical sales (+191%) and Canadian Adult-Use sales (+49%). Canadian medical sales grew 26% and there were no bulk sales to other license producers. Hemp segment revenue decreased 18% to $15.3 million (C$20.5 million) primarily due to a shift to private label product with a large customer and the impact of COVID-related changes to consumer shopping patterns.  Total revenue increased 10% compared to the third quarter of 2020. Cannabis segment revenue increased 31%, driven by a 44% increase in International Medical sales, 27% increase in Adult-Use sales, and a 24% increase in Canada Medical sales which was partly offset by a 23% decline in Hemp sales.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9115168.0|public|confidence|self|TILRAY Q4 Earnings 🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm5mxl/tilray_q4_earnings/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-17|WIRE

He was talking about the video game store GameStop and how their stock price had the potential to be “short squeezed” due to excessive retail buying, which would cause hedge funds to close their short positions, meaning the price could now go really high cause no shorts.  I liked what I heard. I’m the kind of person who’s always down to make a quick dollar, and I was excited by the idea of being able to make the hedge funds squirm. We all know they’re the ones who caused the ‘08 financial crash, which led to my father losing his job over a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by one of his co-workers.  Now I trusted EliteTrader42069 for two reasons specifically:  - He only posts his gains. It’s almost like he NEVER makes a losing trade.  - He uses a still of Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street as his profile picture, which leads me to believe he’s a Wolf of Wall Street in his own regard.  Long story short, I opened an E-Trade account the following day. I had been up the entire night prior watching “The Big Short” and blasting lines of ketamine. I was ready to go. The issue was, I had no money to make an initial investment with.  But I was so positive that GME to $1000 was a sure thing that I took a risk. E-Trade said that although an ACH deposit would take 5 trading days to complete, they would make up to 50% of it available to trade instantly. That’s all I needed to hear.  $200,000 deposit. $100,000 available right away. I don’t care that my Bank of America balance is $12.93. I’m ready to go.  I waited for the upward momentum to really pick up speed and pulled the trigger. 241 shares at $414.   Fast forward to today, I’m starting to doubt how foolproof “diamond handing” really is. I’m negative -$87,682 dollars and the E-Trade risk management team emailed me saying that my deposit bounced and they’re opening an investigation into me for wire fraud. I’ve been in my room crying all day waiting for the FBI to knock my door down. My life is ruined.  Screw you WSB. Screw you EliteTrader42069.

And so far they are killing it!  There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.  Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.  “Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.  “H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”  During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, ""We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020."" Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.  During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.  Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).  **Sources**:  Winsight Grocery Business - [How Fast Will Amazon Grow?](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-fast-will-amazon-grow) November 13, 2020  Grocery Dive - [UNFI expects to renew Whole Foods contract, name new CEO early next year](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/unfi-expects-to-renew-whole-foods-contract-name-new-ceo-early-next-year/591956/) December 10, 2020  Business Wire - [Covid-19 Propels Amazon to Top U.S. Grocery Retailer for the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210111005351/en/Covid-19-Propels-Amazon-to-Top-U.S.-Grocery-Retailer-for-the-2021-dunnhumby-Retailer-Preference-Index) January 11, 2021  Forbes - [Why Amazon Grocery Catapulted To The Top Of America’s Favorites List](https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2021/01/25/why-amazon-grocery-catapulted-to-the-top-of-americas-favorites-list/?sh=52e54253203e) January 25, 2021  CSP Daily News - [Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to Focus on Grocery](https://www.cspdailynews.com/company-news/amazons-jeff-bezos-focus-grocery) February 9, 2021  [Amazon 10K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872421000004/amzn-20201231.htm#i75de98b9097f40f3b5884e541f532421_16) (filed February 3, 2021)  [United Natural Foods 10K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1020859/000102085920000064/f2010-k.htm) (filed September 29, 2021)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8852007.0|public|confidence|self|Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery|0.0|[]|0.69|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgynbx/amazon_doubles_down_on_grocery/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-10|WIRE

Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  **The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.**  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.  ***Typical tactics include the following:***  Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with **counterfeit shares.** They will do what has been called a **short down ladder**. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.  Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  ***Media Assault -***  The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.  The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the *Wall Street Journal*, *Barrons*, the *New York Times*, Gannett Publications (*USA Today* and the *Arizona Republic*), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in *USA Today* during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven *USA Today* editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:  &gt;When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.  ***Analyst Reports -***  Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.  ***Planting moles in target companies -***  The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.  ***Frivolous SEC investigations -***  The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.  ***Class Action lawsuits -***  Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.  ***Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -***  If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.  ***Pulling margin from long customers -***  The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on [Pulling Margin](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)).  ***Paid bashers -***  The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for [Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS16ConfessionsOfAPaidStockBasher.html)).  ***This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.***  **How Pervasive Is This?**  At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.  The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. ***It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts***. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.  The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope.  source: [https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8589744.0|public|confidence|self|For the new Apes READ this, if you're illiterate, scroll down to read my sign language|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6rha/for_the_new_apes_read_this_if_youre_illiterate/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-02|WIRE

The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for [Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS16ConfessionsOfAPaidStockBasher.html)).  ***This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.***  **How Pervasive Is This?**  At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.  The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. ***It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts***. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.  The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope.  source: [https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8589741.0|public|confidence|self|For the new Apes READ this, if you're illiterate, scroll down to read my sign language|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6rg9/for_the_new_apes_read_this_if_youre_illiterate/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-02|WIRE

Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html  Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.   Typical tactics include the following:  Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.   Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  Media Assault -  The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.  The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:  When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.   Analyst Reports -  Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.  Planting moles in target companies -  The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.  Frivolous SEC investigations -  The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.  Class Action lawsuits -  Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.  Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -  If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.   Pulling margin from long customers -  The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).  Paid bashers -  The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).  This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.  How Pervasive Is This?  At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.  The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.  The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars.

acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.   Typical tactics include the following:  Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.   Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  Media Assault -  The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.  The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:  When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.   Analyst Reports -  Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.  Planting moles in target companies -  The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.  Frivolous SEC investigations -  The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.  Class Action lawsuits -  Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.  Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -  If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.   Pulling margin from long customers -  The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).  Paid bashers -  The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).  This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.  How Pervasive Is This?  At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.  The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.  The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars.

Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!  #**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**  Responses:  - From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares - From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9. - From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.  - From u/ whateverathrowaway00:  http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and  https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf The documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur. The SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. That’s why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didn’t need a phone call. They’re not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. They’re doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.   #**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**  Responses:   - From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't. - From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create. - From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs   #**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**  Responses:  - From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.  - From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  #**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**   #**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**  Responses:  - Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3   #**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**  Responses:   - From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GME’s float. Why haven’t we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is “at what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover?” The answer is that we don’t know, but it’s only a matter of time.  #**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**  Responses:   - From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.  #**Q8) Isn’t it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**  Responses:   - From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY. Plus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?  #**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**  #**Q10) (from others) I’m trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**  Responses:   - From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed. - From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.  #**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**  Responses:   - An insane amount of deception has been in the works for a long time: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  - Shit's about to get crazy: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/  - Why the squeeze hasn't happened:  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ladv7v/gme_will_squeeze_and_heres_the_10_reasons_why_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  - Shorts covering: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lae73m/psa_remember_shorts_have_two_days_to_deliver_this/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share   #**Q12) I've read a couple of posts that casually mention the possibility that GameStop could issue more shares, pulling in a bunch of money and essentially letting the shorts off the hook. Can GameStop do that? If so, why the hell wouldn’t they?**   #**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us 🦍 and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**   #**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldn’t be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**  ----   I really want this to be helpful for everyone. If you are an expert or have other questions for me to ask, please comment and I will update this post.   Holding 10 GME shares from $90/share. Got another one on Friday at $320 a share. I can't buy anymore but wish i could!  UPDATE: Keep the responses coming please, and note: we are not financial advisors, just awesome retards!|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8537316.0|public|confidence|self|Questions on Short Float, Short Ladder Attacks and Short Squeeze.|9.0|[]|0.99|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la9ymc/questions_on_short_float_short_ladder_attacks_and/|some_ads|7.0||||1612230795.0||||||||||||||||||2021-02-01|WIRE

Just spent the morning trying to buy the dip.  &gt;""This order can't be accepted because it would exceed your current available balance. ""  Talked to a rep at vanguard, and as of TODAY At 6am, you can't buy with money until it's cleared your account (aka 7 days.)  So wire money into your account, rather than transfer it.

my brokerage account into another account. I initiated the transfer this Friday and usually customer service for the brokerages will be closed, so I would get an answer until at least Monday, which may be to late.   So I woul like someone input in who knows the process of the transfer. I'm moving from M1 Finance to WeBull. I am transferring GME stocks. I did not liquidate the account just doing a stock transfer. So I'm curious on the process and how they are executed. I'm assuming I bought a stock and have a digital certificate to that stock. So what common sense would tell is that they will just transfer the electronic stock certificate via wire. I know there will be $75 charge on the senders end. Now will I lose that stock? Or is a pretty safe bet it'll be smooth transfer? Thanks for your help, Im sure some people are interested in this as well. If this was discussed in a previous thread please. Thanks for all your help. Glad everyone is sticking together and having one common goal here.

 **TL;DR:** **Ladder attacks to drive the price down, Media assults, Brokers pulling margin, Paid bashers, Diversion attempts - all tactics seen in recent weeks were predicted by this article from 2014**  -----------------------------------   Transcript if website crashes due to traffic:  -----------------------------------  **Anatomy Of A Short Attack**  Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.  -----------------------------------  **Typical tactics include the following:**   **Flooding the offer side of the board**  Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. **They will do what has been called a short down ladder.** It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  **By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.** If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.  Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  -----------------------------------  **Media Assault**  **The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.**  The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:  When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.  -----------------------------------  **Pulling margin from long customers**  **The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.**  -----------------------------------  **Paid bashers**  The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).  This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.  -----------------------------------  **Analyst Reports**  Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.  -----------------------------------  **Planting moles in target companies**  The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.  -----------------------------------  **Frivolous SEC investigations**  The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.  -----------------------------------  **Class Action lawsuits**  Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.  -----------------------------------  **Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc.**  If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.   ------------------------  **Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is not my work I'm just copy/pasting the article(bolding the most relevant parts, and re-ordering sub-chapters)**  **I'm long GME**"|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8450838.0|public|confidence|self|Important!

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.   Sorry for my bad English.   Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.  I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)   So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.   Backstory:   I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.   So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.   So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.   In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.   Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.   But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.   Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.    The Beer Virus Crash:   I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.   The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.   Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".   After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..   Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack.    And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them   You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.   GME and the global movement:   And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.   So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.   A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.   I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.   So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.   Let's make them pay for what they took from us and if possible, my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!

But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.   Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.    The Beer Virus Crash:   I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses.

It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.   The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs.

Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.   Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".   After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..   Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short.

And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.   Sorry for my bad English.   Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.  I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)   So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.   Backstory:   I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.   So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.   So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.   In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.   Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment.

Heard a DJ on the radio today.  ""Tried to buy GME on RH yesterday, but gave up when it wouldn't let me.""  Really?  You give up that easily?  MAKES ME SO FRUSTRATED.  I'm out here sweating bullets with a lot at stake, on the phone with multiple brokerages making sure I can continue my fight, and this guy gives up because his app won't let him trade.  One thing that has been spectacular is how many people are realizing the benefits of investing.  But guys, Robinhood is not the only portal to investing.  Seriously, though.  WHY HAVEN'T YOU OPENED ANOTHER BROKERAGE ACCOUNT?  It's not as convenient?  Get over it!  You're letting your fellow WSBers down, and ultimately, yourself.  We need you!  TAKE SOME ACTION.  I'll even say please.  I can tell you, the hedge funds are working their ASSES off right now and we have to show the same strength.  There's a stigma that other brokerages are not accessible to us ordinary folks, people with limited experience, or boomerish?  IT IS NOT TRUE.  Anyone can open accounts at the majority of brokerages, and often, it doesn't take more than HOURS.  Worried?  Apply at 5 and go with the first one that approves you.  Once opened, wire the money you need to deposit for typically SAME DAY AVAILABILITY.  Don't know how to send a wire?  Dude, it's like Venmo.  You can usually do it online with your bank, or have them do it for you.  Yes, it will cost $20 but whatever.  Pick a brokerage that has not blocked tickers and has a great reputation for service and reliability - there are many respectable ones out there.  I will not make any recommendations - I'll let people discuss in the comments, but let's go!   If you're sitting on the sidelines, waiting for RH to reinstate these tickers to full trading, I truly don't understand your thinking:  Either A:  1. You're supporting a company that has blatantly manipulated the market, sold our data to the hedge funds, and thrown a complete 180 from their mission to provide access to markets for everyone.  They literally are a huge part of the problem we're trying to address.  But let's just pretend the above can't be proven...hahaha.  Well, there's B:  1. If it is a capacity/server problem, as we have seen RH crash day after day, how will you know you can even sell your holdings when you need to?  Geez, that scares me.  Sure, you can file a lawsuit, but good luck. 2. If the issue is liquidity - take a moment.  Are the other, established brokerages complaining of liquidity?  Look - if a company is strapped for cash and can't meet cash requirements, they are NOT STABLE.  My goodness how will you even get paid when you need to cash out?  Could they go bankrupt?  What happens there?  While I'm sure there are some consumer protections, don't you think that's going to be a mess and it's simply easy enough to eliminate that risk by going elsewhere now?  If a company isn't financially stable, I sure am not keeping my $$ there.  If you've got a legit reason you aren't being proactive and not opening another account, let's hear it.  Of course, only invest in risky bets what you can afford to lose, but other brokerages offer a lot of less risky investments for your future too.  Best of both worlds and welcome to investing!

We know you want to dump them and you bloody well should.  **What you should not do is initiate a transfer.**  Protect your tendies and play your positions otherwise you'll be  cutting off the nose to spite the face.  **A transfer will lock your account and take a little over a week, probably longer as there might be a spike.**  **It also costs you $75.**  **What you should do is open a new brokerage account ASAP.** Wire some dollars in to fund it as some brokers are more strict until your first funds clear.  (Someone please post the image with Brokers that didn't restrict)  **As your positions finish in Robin Hood (e.g. sell out). You should move the cash to the new broker and start new positions.**  I know it's frustrating but imagine getting stuck in something like this again! RH just stopped CC.IV as well.  They are so evil that they limit to one so they can tell and have the media report that buying is limited.  What the fuck reason does someone have to have one $20 stock?!?  It's a halt!  **Then when you have transferred the last of your tendies.**  #DELETE THE ACCOUNT!  RH is coming up on an IPO. Lessen their account numbers! Hit them where it hurts.  Do you keep your Wendy's tendies box when you've eaten them?  You throw it the fuck away.  No one is gonna be cross at you for using them for a bit longer while you properly extract your positions.

Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.  Typical tactics include the following:  Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.  Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  Media Assault -  The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.  The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:  When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|6268111.0|public|confidence|self|EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82gnv/everyone_needs_to_read_this/|some_ads|7.0||||||dark||||||||||||||||2021-01-29|WIRE

we can’t trust the scum at RH or WeBullshit, and E*TRADE unfortunately doesn’t have an instant option other than wire transfers, I’d like to point out that Vanguard let’s you buy shares immediately upon depositing.  On top of that, they let you deposit for both 2020 and 2021 right now so you can put up to $12k in.   I don’t know if any of Vanguard’s any other options allow for quick account setup and depositing as well, but if you already have an account with Vanguard you can literally set up an IRA and fund it in under 20 minutes.  BUT LISTEN UP AUTISTS: you can’t take this money out of the IRA until you’re 50 or else you’ll get taxed to shit. You can buy and sell within the IRA all you want, but withdrawals face a penalty.  I am not a financial advisor, I’m just a full on retard using my IRA to invest in a meme stock. I like this stock.

If I do a wire transfer I'll have the money with-in the day (and probably in less than an hour).  Once your funds clear in the new spot, close EVERYTHING OUT in RH.. Yes, I'm talking about GME, AMC, BB, etc.. everything. Now I hear you shouting me down from the back about diamond hands, and I got you!  Once your funds in your new account have cleared, buy your positions in RH and then close those positions in RH. You won't take any personal loss/gain but you may realize a loss/gain in RH. This will only change things slightly at tax time. I know you can't do math, so I'll help you out.  GME Buy: $82.66   Sell in RH to GTFO: $$277.59   Buy in TD: $277.59\*   Sell after the infinity squeeze: $4200.69!  As you can see the 2 middle trades cancel each other. Now you probably won't be able to fill at the exact same price because GME is volatile as fuck. But that may work to your benefit even. But if you do them at basically the same time the difference will be minimal.   If people wait to close their accounts till next week, or 2 weeks or a month from now, Robinhood will not get the message TODAY that they can't just change the rules. We've become a more united entity, let's show them we won't be fucked with!

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.  **Typical tactics include the following:**  Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.  Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  Media Assault -  The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.  The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the *Wall Street Journal*, *Barrons*, the *New York Times*, Gannett Publications (*USA Today* and the *Arizona Republic*), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in *USA Today* during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven *USA Today* editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:  &gt;When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.  Analyst Reports -  Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.  Planting moles in target companies -  The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.  Frivolous SEC investigations -  The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.  Class Action lawsuits -  Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.  Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -  If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.  Pulling margin from long customers -  The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on [Pulling Margin](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)).  Paid bashers -  The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for [Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS16ConfessionsOfAPaidStockBasher.html)).  ***This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.***  **How Pervasive Is This?**  At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.  The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.  The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope.

I am an engineering student from India. I saw your post on wsb. I have about $60 that I wanted to invest in GME and get in on the action. But I cannot directly in US based companies from India. I can open a US trading account with a brokerage from India through an app like Vested(Similar to RH but for other country people to invest in US based stocks and commodities) but the charges and wire transfer fees are more than my capital so I wouldn't able to invest anything that way.   So, I was hoping that someone could invest it on my behalf. I could PayPal you those $60(I've a bit more than $60 so the charges will be covered) and you could buy a fractional share when the market opens tomorrow. Then after/when you sell your shares, sell mine too and PayPal me whatever profit was made off those 60 dollars. For example: Suppose you managed to get 0.2 share @ $300 per share tomorrow and you sell all your shares @ $900 per share then you can PayPal me $180. We can do the math later whenever you sell.  Now, I realize that there is a substantial risk involved in this and if the price tanked suddenly I wouldn't cry foul and ask you for all the money back. Whatever will be the actual profit/loss, I'll take it.  I know $60 is nothing for you guys but its a lot for me and the profit, however little, could help me a lot.   Here is my pic with today's date and my PAN card(PAN stands for Permanent Account Number. A PAN number is a ten-digit number in alphabets and numerical, or in 'alphanumeric' terms, that is allocated by the income tax department to all the taxpayers, and is unique with each individual. A PAN number helps the authorities keep track of the financial activities of any individual, as PAN is integral to all forms of payments.) https://ibb.co/T0dQD91|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2947053.0|public|confidence|self|Can someone help a guy from India invest a little in GME and help me do my part?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l67ncn/can_someone_help_a_guy_from_india_invest_a_little/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-27|WIRE

Last week I transferred some money into my account to have some fun and get in on this GME action.  Shortly afterwards my ""balance"" went up to match my transfer amount, so like normal.  However it wasn't available to trade, nbd I thought.  I should say every single time I have ever done an EFT or Wire into my Fidelity account the money has been available to trade either that same day or the next day.  It took about 1.5 days for the transfer to complete and for the money to get taken from my bank account.  Since that time I am still unable to use my funds to place trades,  nor can I transfer the money out of my account to possibly use another brokerage.  Fidelity is literally holding my money hostage and all I can do is sit around with my dick in my hand like a jabroni.  This shit has literally gone from $40 to over ~~$200~~ $300 now in the time that my money has been cleared yet unavailable.  I'm only making a post because I now see all the shady shit going on by these companies/shorts and I feel like this is too coincidental.  To add onto that I received a few replies and pm's after commenting about this on the daily threads from people having the same exact problem.  Feeling truly #blessed. Could've been rich but I never even got a chance to send it thanks to the frogs at Fidelity.

I'll be including hyperlinked sources for all stats and claims I make.   # First off, reasons I like BB   A lot of this has been overdone in this subreddit, but in summary:  * Approaching $1B software and licensing revenue on $7.85B market cap (very reasonable price to sales for SAAS) * CEO John Chen has a technical background (BS in Electrical Engineering from Brown, MS in EE from Caltech) [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Chen) * This is super important for tech companies because a technical CEO will actually understand their product and not just be a bean counter (case study: Bob Swan and Intel) * CEO John Chen made the bold move of pivoting from a doomed hardware business to software and has stuck at it for the last 7 years (he's not going anywhere until he accomplishes his mission) * Recent Sony/AWS/etc. partnerships * They are the incumbent in auto OS with Blackberry QNX running on 175 million cars right now [PR Newswire source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html) * 5 years ago, they were at 60 million, so that's a CAGR of 23.8% per year (though that's starting to slow - 2019 to 2020 was 150M --&gt; 175M so 16.7% as they reach saturation I imagine + COVID) * Diversified revenue streams (licensing, patents, QNX, Spark, etc.) * IEC safety certs + possibility of integrating with their own security products ([https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)) (I haven't found anything similar for Android Automotive yet, let me know if there is)  # What is Android Automotive? (hint: not the same as Android Auto)  * First off, Google made this very confusing by having two different things called ""Android Automotive"" (the OS) and ""Android Auto"" (the app) * [Here's what they say](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive):  &gt;**Android Automotive is Android**. Android Automotive is not a fork or parallel development of Android. It is the same codebase and lives in the same repository as the Android shipped on phones, tablets, etc. It builds on a robust platform and feature set developed over 10+ years, enabling it to leverage the existing security model, compatibility program, developer tools, and infrastructure while continuing to be highly customizable and portable, completely free, and open source   &gt;   &gt;**Android Automotive extends Android**. In the course of building Android into a full-featured platform for infotainment, we’re adding support for automotive-specific requirements, features, and technologies. Android Automotive will be a full-stack, turnkey automotive infotainment platform, just as Android is for mobile today.  ""Android Automotive is Android"". That's a big thing. That means:  * Android Automotive is backed by Google and Google's Android teams * Android Automotive is backed by the Android open source community  * Android Automotive can integrate closer with Google Play Store, Google Maps, and Google Assistant (literal quote from Nissan's press release [here](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4-180918-01-e) which I cover later) * Any Android developers should theoretically be able to write an app for Android Automotive without too much retraining * We're talking about software here, so ultimately it's up to engineers and developers to actually use it * In the past, software deals were signed by taking CTOs and account executives to steakhouses and golfing excursions.  * These days, engineers are a lot more involved - oftentimes spinning up prototypes to demo for their leadership before any deals are signed. (Or if they aren't, that's a huge red flag for any company that relies on tech.)  # Developer friendliness case study: documentation  This sounds dumb, but let's look at what documentation engineers would have to work with:  Virgin Blackberry QNX docs: [http://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29183](http://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29183)  * Folder icons and entire page literally look out of Windows XP * You have to download PDFs (what are you going to do, print them all out and arrange them in your cubicle?)  Chad Android Automotive docs: [https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/evs/camera\_system](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/evs/camera_system)  * Super clean, super easy to read, all in the browser, well organized  Compare these to successful API-based SAAS services like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) or [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api). If you were a developer and learning auto OS for the first time, what would you rather use?  Obviously, no company is going to pick an operating system based on their documentation alone, but I think it reveals a lot about the development ecosystem that their engineers will have to operate in. And ever more these days, engineers are empowered to guide their leadership in what software they want to use (e.g. engineers would rather use easy-to-use MongoDB than stuffy old Oracle).  # Market Share  * As mentioned at the beginning, Blackberry QNX is killing it with 175M cars on the road * That's the main reason why I like it in the short term - huge amounts of recurring SAAS revenue  I'm worried that in 5-10 years, Apple and Google are going to come in and eat Blackberry's lunch just like they did with mobile:  * GM will use Android Automotive in all their cars starting in 2021 [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment)  &gt;General Motors will use Google’s new Android Automotive OS to power the infotainment systems in its cars starting in 2021, the two companies announced on Thursday. That means **Google Assistant, Maps, and other automotive-approved Android apps** will be available in GM’s cars via the Play Store without requiring the use of an Android smartphone.  * Nissan, Renault, and Mitsubishi are using Android Automotive [Nissan press release](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4-180918-01-e)  &gt;World's leading automotive alliance signs a global multiyear agreement to partner with Google to equip Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles with intelligent infotainment systems   &gt;   &gt;The Alliance will utilize Android, world's most popular operating system, to offer customers a new array of services including **Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play Store**   &gt;   &gt;These services will be combined with Alliance Intelligent ""Cloud based"" remote software upgrades and vehicle diagnostics  * Porche's new all electric Taycan will be using Apple Car Play for all the cool software stuff (infotainment, music, etc.) while maintaining Blackberry QNX for the car critical functions [source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-big-tech-companies-may-soon-edge-out-automakers-with-advanced/) * While BB still gets their share, if the Apple/Intel developments are any indication, Apple will use 3rd parties to get going but their obsession with seamless hardware/software in their products makes me wonder how long it'll take before Apple does their own car OS  # Summary  * Big picture, the auto OS market is huge, ""expected to hit $4.5B by 2026"" so there's plenty of money to go around. It's possible Blackberry QNX, Android Automotive, and other OS may all flourish together. [global news wire source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html) * That said, I find it very worrying that companies like GM, Nissan, Porsche are deciding to partner with the Google and Apple for their new models (obviously, they have no incentive to retrofit old/existing cars with new OS) * Short term BB's biggest moat comes from their incumbent market share + security guarantees (ie as a customer you'd get IEC certs for free by using BB QNX). I think their next few years will remain cushy. * Long term, I don't see any guarantee that auto manufacturers (especially start-ups composed of SV engineers) wouldn't go with open source Android Automotive over closed source Windows XP docs BB QNX that reeks of like IBM/Oracle/HP type boomer software. * BB does have diversified revenue with their security offerings, so though QNX is a large portion of their revenue, it's not all.  As mentioned earlier, I do have shares of BB (as well as GOOGL) and think BB will have a jolly good time in the next 3-5 years. But I do worry that Google and Apple will come in and repeat what they did to Blackberry with mobile.

As I was writing, I found that Leadership is a very important part of the Smartsheet story and it needed its own article to do it justice. You can read [Part 1 here](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2021/01/01/deep-dive-2-part-1-of-2-smartsheet-solving-the-productivity-paradox/). * Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that’s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people * I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.  Hi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. I’m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR). Let’s dive in.  **Can we 10X from here?**  For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “Do I think this investment could 10x from here?”. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.  The framework includes:  Leadership – Desire, Purpose and Ownership  Risk Considerations  Price Considerations  Explosive Business Growth  **1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose, Ownership**  For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer’s excellent book “100 Baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “Owner Operators”. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It’s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?  In the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.  After that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6’4”, 245lb offensive lineman.  Mark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he’s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said “We have 74,000 customers that don’t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.” How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I’ll share with you a little more history behind the company.  After Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn’t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.  The focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000’s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying “I believe it’s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,”. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right – they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong – their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.  Only a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today – clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it’s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.  Going back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to “not get too enamored with your product”. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they’re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don’t buy a stock based on what you’ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. “If you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business” he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.  One of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It’s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.  Further evidence to support Mark and the rest of management’s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That’s very impressive as well.  Based on how customers are responding to the product, I think it’s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that “Desire and Purpose” are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the “Productivity Paradox” that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that’s what we want.  Another way to see if the leader of the company has “Desire and Purpose” is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they’re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people’s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company’s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he’s communicating the company’s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.  There’s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded “Best Company Culture” and “Best Companies for Women” by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It’s one thing to be awarded for “Best Company Culture” but to also be a “Best Companies for Women” when you’re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people’s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.  Source – Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.  I think we’ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It’s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they’ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we’ve established is present, there’s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.  Currently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I’d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he’s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that’s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.

SCHN, POSCO PKX and Olympic Steel, Inc. ZEUS.  Link:https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1244918/steel-industry-starts-2021-on-upbeat-mood-5-solid-picks  The steel industry has kicked off the new year on a high note building on the strong recovery that started in the final quarter of 2020. Shares of major steel companies are heading higher this month. The momentum has been driven by surging steel prices on the back of rising steel demand amid supply shortage and prospects of infrastructure stimulus package this year from the Biden administration.  Material stocks got a thrust after the U.S. Congress formally certified Joe Biden as the next President last Thursday. Biden has proposed spending $2 trillion over four years to boost clean energy and rebuild infrastructure. The planned investment includes building and repairing roads, bridges, water systems, electricity grids and broadband aimed at fixing America's ""crumbling"" infrastructure.  American steel stocks have been gaining this month on hopes that the sizable infrastructure spending would have a beneficial effect on the U.S. steel industry given the expected increase in consumption of the commodity that is used to make almost everything from rail tracks to roads to bridges and tunnels.  Notably, shares of major U.S. steel makers such as United States Steel Corp.  are up 37% this month.  The optimism can also be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Steel Producers industry has gained 10.6% so far this month, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 1.9% appreciation.  The steel industry has been urging for an infrastructure package since the early days of the pandemic. Leading U.S. steel industry groups, in March 2020, had called on Congress to include significant infrastructure investment in the next stimulus package to help the nation recover from the fallout of the deadly virus outbreak.  The pandemic-induced demand destruction put a crimp on the steel industry for much of the first half of 2020. However, an upturn in demand from the key industries such as automotive and construction, and an upswing in steel prices have pulled the industry out of its funk. Automotive and construction together account for a big chunk of steel consumption.  Recovery started to gain steam toward the end of the third quarter of 2020 on resumption of operations across major steel-consuming sectors following easing of lockdowns and restrictions across the world. Steel prices are also shooting higher on an upturn in demand. Steel stocks also started to rebound in the second half of 2020 after getting hammered during the first half along with most other commodities amid the pandemic-led demand slowdown.  Steel makers are seeing strong order booking in automotive. Recovery in the automotive industry has accelerated following pandemic-led shutdowns on the back of strong customer demand. The automotive rebound is driving demand for flat steel products globally.  Moreover, the revival in the construction sector globally is driving demand for long and flat steel products in this major market. The construction sector has also bounced back on the heels of a resumption of projects that were stalled earlier due to supply chain disruptions and manpower shortage. In particular, the non-residential construction market remains resilient.  Meanwhile, a strong recovery in construction and manufacturing activities is driving demand for steel in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity. Steel demand is being driven by the Chinese government’s spending on infrastructure projects. A rebound in China’s demand has instilled optimism in the steel space.  Moreover, steel prices are on an upswing on the back of rising demand, supply shortages and higher raw material costs. Notably, U.S. steel prices have staged a strong recovery and hit record levels after cratering to pandemic-induced multi-year lows in August 2020.  The benchmark hot-rolled coil (“HRC”) prices started to recover in September and are screaming higher since then. Prices zoomed past $900 per short ton in December on U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, tight supply and rising demand, and are hovering near the $1,000 per short ton level last attained in 2008. In fact, HRC prices have catapulted to levels not seen in more than 10 years and doubled the lows witnessed in August.  A key reason behind the spurt in steel prices is the demand-supply imbalance. Lead times for steel delivery at U.S. steel mills remain extended, indicating healthier demand. Moreover, supply remains restricted due to the idling of blast furnaces and production disruptions associated with mill outages.  These coupled with lower steel imports due to the pandemic and tariffs have resulted in the tightening of steel supplies, a situation which is likely to sustain over the short haul. Steel scrap prices are also on the rise amid tight supply. As such, there is room for further upside in HRC prices as the fundamentals driving factors remain in place.  Higher demand, elevated input costs and supply constraints are likely to continue lending support to HRC prices over the near term. Higher prices would drive profitability and cash flows of steel companies.  5 Red-Hot Steel Stocks to Buy Now  Improving fundamentals in the steel industry make this space an attractive area to invest in right now.

Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&amp;P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.  Moreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week’s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.  Reflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager’s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.  Meanwhile, the World Steel Association (“worldsteel”) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.  Separately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.  4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now  The outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand.

I was a bit hesitant at first because one of my post got removed by the mods when this company was still a SPAC. But now since December 22nd it is trading on the Nasdaq as a new public company with the ticker GOEV.  This post may or may not be removed by the mods but here you go as requested.   I’m a former sell side professional for a big firm so my methodology is based on my experience and the information publicly available including data and financial projections published by the company. In consequence I have less data and insight than insiders and early Hedge Funds investors. This is my personal view and not a recommendation of any sort.  Prerequisite is that you already know the basics of Canoo which is a Californian based EV company pre production and pre revenue. Their unique selling points include a proprietary steer-by-wire skateboard technology so they can interchange “top hats” and develop new vehicles much faster and a subscription-only business model for their first B2C lifestyle vehicle. They also have B2B EV on a more classic selling scheme.   I invite you to read the top comments from the OP as they contain valuable developments.   **The Market Cap and New Shares Issuance**  Based on SEC filings the number of shares of new Canoo is as follows:  * 175M held by old Canoo shareholders (including management and employees) * 32.325M held by PIPE * 37,307,189 Hennessy C A C converted to GOEV which for now represents the only tradable shares at this time  To which we need to add shares that could be issued in the next weeks:  * 36,092,750 warrants (ratio 1 warrant for 1 share) of which 22,511,250 public and 13,581,500 private * 15M Earnout Shares for management: three lots of 5M shares each at Milestones for share price to reach $18 $25 and $30  aggregating all these elements and only 5M Earnout Shares so far we get 285,724,939 outstanding shares ; at $14.50 per share that’s a market cap of $4.14bn. Note that you would get an extra dilution of 1.7% for every 5M new Earnout Shares issued. Also there is a lack of transparency until Canoo produces a new SEC filing in which the company update the exact number of outstanding shares. For instance when I check market cap on IBKR it would tell me $3.6bn and a totally wrong number of shares. I did not find any info about the PIPE lock period to hold their shares. In fact these kind of deals can remain undisclosed for a certain time. But some large pre existing shareholders including founders, directors, holders of 3%+ pre-SPAC have deals to hold their shares for a total of 116.2M for a period in between 6M to 12M after the Closing of the Business Combination (21-Dec-20).  **Chairman Tony Aquila vs CEO Ulrich Kranz**  I want to address this subject early in this thread for three reasons. First it is not discussed enough on the internet. Second it potentially has massive implications in the public perception of the company. And third insiders and HF have a massive advantage if they know what drama is going on amid the board. I believe it was first reported by The Verge dot com so I’ll quote them on the matter:  Aquila told The Verge the company’s immediate focus has changed. “When I invested in [Canoo], I didn’t invest in it for the lifestyle vehicle. To me, I saw that as a derivative, but that the real asset was this multipurpose delivery platform,” he said.  “The way I would look at it is this is a re-founding of the company, just kind of like Elon did to Tesla”. Aquila, who comes from a finance and software background, invested $35M in Canoo this summer through his firm before the merger and before he was elevated to chairman. “He put money in [Tesla], just like I did, became the chair, had a different vision, comes out of the tech world. So I can completely relate and appreciate what he’s done for the industry.”  Founders always intended to use the van’s modular platform to power other vehicles, but Aquila is supercharging that vision by accelerating those plans.  With that in mind, there are changes being made to corporate structure. Ulrich Kranz, one of the BMW executives who co-founded Canoo and the current CEO, is no longer on the company’s board of directors. He’ll instead be a “special adviser” to Aquila, and while he’ll remain CEO, his contract was renegotiated and now includes language that accounts for the possibility of him being replaced (SEC filings).   “I want to build a world class company here, and what I’ve said to everyone is, look, you’re going to go as far in this company and as big as this company as we all collectively do. But it’s like a baseball team. Everybody’s got to play their position and they’ve got to play it really well for every season, and those positions can change over time,” Aquila told The Verge when asked about Kranz’s new contract. “There’s definitely a role [for Kranz]. There’s definitely advice that can happen. But to scale an organization at this level, I mean, that’s a different experience than he has.”  And they add: For what it’s worth, if Kranz is removed as CEO but remains as Aquila’s adviser, his salary will more than triple from $648K to $2.5M. [end of quote]  Now, it is up to the market and every single investor to ultimately judge this move. What is irrefutable although is that it injects a lot of uncertainty to the company at a very sensible time when they just turned public. My personal opinion is I don’t like at all. I am way more confident with an individual as Kranz who has co-founded the company, who used to be the boss of Project i at BMW. He led the release of the gorgeous i8 and the i3 who are arguably among the most iconic EV produced by traditional automakers. He’s an engineer with a long track-record in the auto industry and he sounds humble. On the other hand you have a late investor who didn’t do anything significant in the industry who just ousted Kranz from the board. And to add insult to injury he dares compare himself to Papa Musk.  Now imagine you have millions on the line. A company pre revenue. Egocentric chairman who is trying to be the new Elon. And you got in at $10 per unit with a free 1-for-1 warrant to ride. You can easily imagine it makes sense taking profit and move to the next play. While still having exposition to price appreciation thanks to the warrants. To finish on this point the Investor Presentation and the original YouTube videos presented Kranz as the face of the company. But the latest video on the B2B EV is all about Aquila bragging.  **The Price Action vs Value**  The hot question right now is how low the share price can fall. It’s 14.50 at the time of my writing. And it basically been red every single day since the initial GOEV quote on Nasdaq on December 22nd. It actually opened +20% on that day and rallied to 14.90 +27% (10c below the 15.00 Milestone to unlock a new 5M potential issuance to management) but then sharply (maybe surprisingly?) reversed to finish the day negative.  I’ll go quickly about valuation because it is solely based on financial projections provided by the company in the Investor Presentation to the SEC in August 2020. I agree that they proposed conservative assumptions although there is obviously a variety of risks which could prevent them to reach their goals. On a DCF model you get 3 scenarii with $12.25 $18.50 and $24.50 price targets low mid high (before any dilution / new shares) on a 20% discount rate. Interestingly the SOTP model including a Netflix type of business model / margins for the B2C would bring you to a $35.75 per share.   That’s based on what they knew about themselves in the summer. Closer to the Business Combination date they have raised their guidance: Hennessy said on 7 Dec: “Since announcing the transaction, Canoo has seen substantial growth in consumer demand and significant interest from potential partners in its proprietary market leading EV platform and underlying technologies. Canoo is efficiently allocating capital by leveraging this platform and has identified new opportunities significantly increasing its TAM (total addressable market) in both B2B and B2C (business to customer) end markets. We have never been more excited about the future of Canoo and look forward to closing our planned merger later in December.”  There is a clear disconnection between the perceived discounted value of the company and the probably exaggerated beating the share price is taking since it is floating as a new Canoo. Undoubtedly a lot of paper handed retail investors have been shaken - some of them at a loss. But again that’s the Risk and Reward of a SPAC play in general and furthermore through merger. It is designed for HF to make risk-less money in exchange of lending large amounts for the initial SPAC-IPO. Nobody wants to pay the bill once the redemption window has closed.  If you are a mid long term believer in Canoo the brand then $15 a share is cheap for what this company could become - all things equal.   **The Vision**  When I imagine an individual vehicle in the near future I for sure think of a non-fossil energy one. So EV or any sustainable energy are the sense of history. But what about consumption habits?  It used to be: you buy a car you lose circa 20% VAT value as soon as you’ve paid the check  + an extra % of value instantly destroyed because it becomes a second-hand product without a natural price appreciation (as opposed to a house or a Swiss manufactured watch). You have to take care of it, insure it and when you don’t need it anymore you need to engage time, effort, and cost to resell it.   I can totally see their B2C business model playing out: you download an app, you register, you choose your skin, you pay $599 a month (maybe less?) and you go driving your EV. Insurance, caretake, charging included. Once you’ve bored of it you finish your month and that’s it. No more liability no headache. The next step being the car drives itself to a certain degree. Which they also incorporated as about-to-be-ready (2.5 autonomy out of 5). But apparently that’s not good enough for Aquila who wants to push B2B. I have the feeling the stock is being partly punished for his arrogance.   **The PR and Marketing**  See for yourself. Go on their insta and YouTube and compare with the other EV competitors outside of the whales Tesla and so on. They are above. They took communication seriously. You can even spot Off-White and Bape skins in one of their promo video. But again they must decide on who will be The Face of their brand. And this decision will be extremely pivotal. They are offering a new lifestyle. Don’t show off an old irrelevant investor or get punished for it.  One word on American-made: I believe there is a tradition of buying American cars for the American people. So it’s going to be Tesla on the U.S soil or among the new offering locally designed. I don’t see Nio and the likes gaining a significant market share over there. That said Canoo has had large Chinese investors stakes before the SPAC.  **The Warrants**  I have witnessed a lot of speculation around them so let’s have a clearer picture. The company wrote: Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering and will expire five years after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.  Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last reported sale price of the Company’s shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. [end of quote]  I know it’s not that easy to read so let me go straight to the point. GOEVW (so the Warrant) will be exercisable once both these 2 events have passed. Initial SPAC-IPO (5-Mar-19) +12months so 5-Mar-20 so that has passed we clear. And Business Combination was on 21-Dec-20 +30days = on 21st January 2021 the Warrant will be exercisable. The company can not redeem the warrants before they are exercisable.   So I personally don’t see any sophisticated scheme here. They are 1 for 1 ratio with an exercise price of $11.50. The intrinsic value is 3.00 when GOEV is 14.50. They have ranged 3.20 3.82 today with a now price of 3.45 (on 14.50 ref). So the extra 0.45 is comparable to the time value in options. The expiry is quite far on 25-Sep-25 so the time decay or theta burn is negligible on a daily basis. Altogether that could be an indication that warrant holders are not panicking and not dumping their W for a discount and estimate that GOEV is credible enough to trade above 11.50 on a long haul.  **Open Thread**  This was supposed to be a quick write-up but it actually took longer than I thought and I probably will add more elements in the edit and/or comments.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1755823.0|public|confidence|self|Canoo Stop or GOEV|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knql7l/canoo_stop_or_goev/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||||||2020-12-31|WIRE

The wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.   But this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?  Before I proceed, I know most people who read my posts can't read, and I am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text, so here is the short form  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**   https://preview.redd.it/ddzg718of5861.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b39c19f793dee8366fc2bafbc55bfe49d49836  This was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017  [https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)    I started by looking at the S&amp;P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today’s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.  There is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.  I agree with Peter Thiel’s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the “world of stuff”. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched  out like a tree and built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed  into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.  So I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.  **Information Technology Cycles**  The following is my attempt at describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.  Electronic Age   **Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace physical labor.   (Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)  **Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.   (Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)  **Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.   (Important companies: AT&amp;T, NBC, IBM)  Computing/Software Age   **Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace  basic mental labor.   (Important companies: IBM)  **From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.   (Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)  **Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.   (Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)  Cloud/AI Age   **Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.   (Candidate Important companies**:** AWS, Microsoft, Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)  **Specialized AI (2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.   (Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)  **General AI (2075-2100):** Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.  The average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.  The initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:  In the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.  The proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).  The consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.  What it means today,  I would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.  **From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.  It is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.  2020 Update:  If we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever.    I have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above s is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.  Also  to assuage of rumors, I am not Peter Thiel or Mike Green.  Position Update;   Now have $220k in shares  (bought another \~$90k in shares yesterday, still about 30k (down from 50k) in calls.

First though, a couple of things:  1.  I joined Reddit two years ago, because someone suggested I look at something on there, haven’t used it until recently when my son rushed me to start posting because I helped a lot of people on the way down and on the way back up make $.   2.  I’ve been in the steel business for 25 years and own my own company with sales and operations throughout US, Canada and Mexico. I no longer handle the day to day, but am still President.  I’m also helping an EV company I invested in procure steel from my many contacts I have bought from and made over 25 years in the business. I also have some Domino’s pizza franchises. I can tell you when to short them and Papa John’s. It all has to do with the price of clock cheese on the CME. If it eclipses $3.00 - it starts being an unprofitable business. That almost happened in June of this year when it hit $2.89/lb.   To whomever the asshats are that think I’m a MM/hedge fund - you should keep crawling down that rabbit hole you fucking retard.   Look, this is my take and I’m deep into it - I’m cutting purchases orders daily for wire rod and steel plate for our manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico with $MT and none of the purchase orders have prices on them. They are merely place holders in line and that line has now stretched until June. The orders will be placed at price time of shipment.  THIS DID NOT EVEN HAPPEN IN 2008.   As for $MT, yes they are different company than in 2008 when two companies combined to form $MT a couple years prior.   They have spent the past 14 years getting rid of the dead weight and older, non-strategic facilities and investing in smarter, value-added ones.   It is all going to pay off - and I believe NOW is the time.   I also buy a lot of steel from US domestic suppliers and they are facing a scrap increase that we have NEVER seen.   Shredded steel scrap - the main ingredient in US steel making jumped three times this past month for a total increase of $135/ton.   This is UNPRECEDENTED and will be passed on 100% to customers in the for of new orders.   This is what I got yesterday from someone inside one of the largest steel mills in the US:  Says scrap will be up $70/ton in January.   Look for another $3.00/cwt + increase   They also went up immediately the full increase on “new orders” for 20’ rebar   Scrap brokers are short shipping to domestic mills…he said if a mill buys 10K tons of scrap , they receive 7K ton. This is putting a strain on their supply.  Strain on supply = less supply finished goods = demand very high = MUCH MUCH higher prices.   THIS IS A GLOBAL situation.   So much in fact, China decided to pass this, which came across last night from one of my brokers in Tokyo:  MEIS2020: China's next move on steel scrap imports will move global markets, Turkey panelists say China resuming steel scrap imports in 2021 will directly affect global steel markets because of supply shortages, speakers on the Turkey panel at Fastmarkets' recent Middle East Iron and Steel virtual conference said.  China will end the ban on imports of ferrous scrap on January 1 after it  reclassified certain qualities steelmaking raw materials under the new regulations.   On December 23, China's Ministry of Finance also announced the country will remove its 2% import tax rate on ferrous scrap and revive its most-favored-nation duty rate system from January 1.  Görkem Bolaca, managing director at international trading firm Galex Steel International, expects China to start importing about 15-20 million tonnes of scrap in 2021.  Turkey imported 18,856,851 tonnes of steel scrap in 2019, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). This figure made Turkey the biggest scrap importer in the world last year.  Globally, about 100 million tonnes of scrap is traded every year, and China's expected import volumes will have a direct affect on global steel production, conference delegates heard.  Didem Taskiran, sales manager at Turkish steelmaker Çolakoglu, said the impact of China's decision has already been observed in the steel sector. Scrap prices have increased sharply since the beginning of November, when rumors of the imminent new regulation started to be heard.  Fastmarkets' daily index for steel scrap, HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20 mix), North Europe origin, cfr Turkey was calculated at $462.78 per tonne on December 22, up nearly 50% from $308.60 per tonne on November 17.   ""We expect scrap prices to go up further,"" Taskiran said, adding that Chinese demand for scrap will mostly be for shredded and bonus scrap.  ""We [as Turkish steel producers] are importing a lot, and local scrap supply is not enough for local production. Chinese imports will affect the prices on an upward trend. Unlike flat steel, long steel prices are directly affected by scrap costs. In addition, if China starts importing scrap, they will be ready to pay any price,"" she said.  ""We expect China to start importing scrap in June,"" Taskiran added.  In the wider context of the steel scrap market, availability of steel scrap is limited.  Russia's Ministry of Economic Development has approved an amendment to its export duty on ferrous scrap to raise the minimum duty to ?45 per tonne to combat the threat of a shortage of steelmaking raw materials in the domestic market. The duty is expected to be imposed in early 2021, according to a source close to the matter.  Ersun Özdemirel, strategy and marketing manager at Turkish flats re-roller and coated steel producer Borcelik, said decisions to switch to electric arc furnace production, which uses scrap as a feedstock, rather than blast furnaces could be driven by environmental concerns.  The European Commission is reviewing European Union rules on waste shipments to encourage more recycling within the EU and is exploring ways to reduce the exports of such materials.  ""The European Union especially is working to reduce carbon emissions and in mid-2021 they will announce Green Deal regulations. If they apply the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), EAF production will be advantageous and we will see demand for scrap increase,"" Özdemirel said.  ""In the future, scrap might be scarce and much more valuable,"" he forecasted.  Europe and the United States have a 80% share in Turkey's scrap imports. The country also uses hot briquetted iron for steel production, mainly imported from Libya and Russia.  Ok, so we already have an iron ore shortage and prices at ATH.   Now, China is targeting steel scrap because they can’t get enough raw material to take care of their own infrastructure needs.   This will MOVE THE GLOBAL markets as it says above.   How does $MT fit in - it’s simple they will be selling product at much higher prices with higher revenues = higher margins = higher EPS.   For you fucking retards simple math:  If you normally sell a product at $600/ton and your margin is 20% - you are making $150/ton.   With increases you sell the same product for $1000/ton and your margin is 20% (maybe more for an integrated manufacturer like $MT) your margin is $250 per ton.   You have increased sales and revenue by by 66% on the same business EVEN if your business volume stays flat - which it isn’t.   Their business is growing and their PT has been increased by Goldman’s, Jeffries and KeyBanc.   I got banned for posting the KeyBanc increase.   Anyhow - make your own decisions.   If you don’t want to buy $MT - don’t.

(“Blade” or the “Company”), a technology-powered air mobility company, announced today that it will become publicly listed in order to bolster Blade’s growth trajectory within the rapidly growing urban air mobility market and to accelerate its transition from conventional aircraft to eVTOL. Currently, more people fly helicopters in and out of U.S. city centers via Blade than any other company in the world. Urban air mobility is expected to be a $125 billion market by 2025 and grow to $650 billion over the next decade, according to Morgan Stanley Equity Research.  Blade operates in four key lines of business:  Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders).  BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1.  BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of eVTOL, before flights for passengers.  International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1701672.0|public|confidence|self|$EXPC SPAC announces merger with Blade.

Their 1st vehicle will begin mass production in 2022. You can look at it [HERE](https://www.canoo.com/design/)  It plans to offer it's product (vehicles) through a subscription based model. These subscriptions could be 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1+ year, etc. The subscription includes the vehicle, registration, maintenance, charging, and access to insurance.   **What Puts Them Ahead?**  There's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway.   The most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top ""shell"" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests.   Their **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.  Now the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers ""drive electric"".  This is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........  **The Stock Itself:**  Canoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.

It’s $11 right now and up 7% today alone. It's the next PLTR but they actually have a product. $SȦMA 1/15/2021 $20c. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  Good evening to all – It’s your boy, Tales of Stock’s here. I have come out of retirement and taken a break from my usual routine of fucking sluts, yachting around the world and getting my toes licked by Dan Bilzerian to speak once again with my follow dumbasses, bagholders, suckers, Young Trillionaires… and yes, even the hater’s. I have come to pump the shit out of **UHHHH I MEAN**… I have come to... *recommend* a stock that I think you all should buy. Heh heh, yeah that’ll work. You might remember me as [the guy whose reddit post single-handedly killed WeWork](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6618z/real_dd_i_read_analysed_all_180_pages_of_the/).   **Clever Leaves** (Listed as $SȦMA right now, soon to be $CLVR on Dec 18th once they’re added to the Nasdaq) is basically one thing – They’re a low cost producer of pharmaceutical-grade skunk weed. They have bigass facilities in Columbia  with 10million square feet of cannabis production, and they’re definitely not involved in any cocaine production. If you’ve seen Narcos, you know that nothing shady ever happens in Columbia. I haven’t watched it but I have it on good word that there’s talk about “Plato and Plomo”, which I think means Plantains and Plumage. A tropical paradise, no?  So what’s the problem with weed companies like ACB, Tilray and Cronos? Well, they put the cart before the horse with their acquisition-before-product strategies. If you don’t know what that means because you’re a 14 year old using your parents’ names to make a Robinhood account, it basically means they fucked themselves over by expanding too fast into buying random fucking companies (Bespoke grow rooms, anyone?) with their investor money without actually growing their weed at an affordable rate. The cost of producing weed isn’t economical in Canada because the conditions for growing it there suck and the labor costs and taxes are insane. A bunch of companies set up shop in Canada since it was the first real country to legalize weed (**Ur**u**g**u**ay** doesn't count) and because they were fans of some guys called Tim Horton and Terry Fox, but ironically gimped themselves in the process. CLVR is going to sell weed to hipster Europeans who don't know how much they're overpaying, it fucking owns. They already have production and offices in Portugal and Germany. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  CLVR is going to eliminate all competitors in the end. *Period*. Any dumbass can throw a seed in the ground in their backyard and piss on it daily and harvest enough pissweed to get them through the winter. Legalized weed is a cannibalistic exercise and a terrible investment because once you legalize, the margin on the product drops through the floor and it gets really fucking hard to produce the product (you know, the actual weed?) at a price that won’t see you burn through cash like an ashy crackhead on his last rock. If you are actually reading this whole post and didn't just glaze over and buy in because it was really long, PM me and I'll send you my wife's boyfriend's nudes that she sends me to mock how much of a loser I am. Regardless, **the only way to make money in legalized weed is to grow at insanely low prices and under cut the competition which will allow you to buy up market share and then buy out the competition, and then start to raise prices**, which is CLVR's strategy. I learned this from a scene in The Wire btw.  I once called ACB the Goodwill of pot stocks because they bring in just about anything they can find and it’s staffed by retards. CLVR is the opposite, the people running the company have been there from the start and don’t get fired and replaced once a year like most Canadian pot stock companies execs. [Here's a video of the CEO explaining their company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCE-DTSYuA). I gotta be honest kinda zoned out but he doesn't come off like a grifter to me so that's probably a good thing. He used to work in Blackstone and was an actual investor, which is basically the opposite of a WSB poster, so that means he's undoubtedly profitable. The rest of the management and SPAC team is a group of rich-ass investment banker crackers, so you just know they're finna make some coin. Here are some more rocket emojis. 🚀🚀🚀🚀  Does CLVR make any money right now? NOPE. Does that matter? Hell fuckin no, are you retarded?? But do you know how much money that ACB, TLRY and CRON burn through on a monthly basis? An absolute fuckload more. [Here's their prospectus if you want some pretty pictures and fewer words that will convince you that this is the right decision](https://samcospac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAMA-Clever-Leaves-LOI-Investor-Presentation.pdf).

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.  # **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments. ***** &gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic. ***** &gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957. ***** &gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year. ***** &gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December. ***** &gt; “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%. ***** &gt; “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500. ***** &gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S. ***** &gt; # Jobs report &gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday. ***** &gt; “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities. ***** &gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices. ***** &gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs. ***** &gt; “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons. ***** &gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast. ***** &gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington. ***** &gt; “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?” ***** &gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer ***** &gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive. ***** &gt; “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.” *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**  *****  &gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined  &gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.  &gt; In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling  &gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.  &gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.  &gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**  *****  &gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For  &gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.  &gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**  &gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**  &gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**  *****  &gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan  &gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.  &gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.  &gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**  *****  &gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds  &gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.  &gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.  &gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**  *****  &gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful  &gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.  &gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.  &gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Let’s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”  &gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn’t only about the US anymore.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-14-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful?

And will continue to penalize gas vehicles  while pumping money into electric car companies until it happens.  &amp;#x200B;  It isn't like in the United States where electric cars are having to compete with gas vehicles, and then different states have different laws regarding subsidies for electric cars and every 2/4 years we have elections and the republicans roll back all of the incentives put in place by the democrats. China has one party. And that party is the Communist party. And the Communist party does whatever the fuck they want.  &amp;#x200B;  China's single party system coupled with their command economy allows them to make unilateral decisions and execute them extremely effectively.  &amp;#x200B;  Couple this with the fact that China has a population of nearly 1.4 billion and you can see that Chinese EV companies have a long way to climb before they run out of steam.  The fact that NIO is based in China is a GOOD thing. The Chinese government has decided that EV sales will be 25% by 2025. period. It will happen. And the 3 companies best positioned to deliver on this directive are NIO, XPEV, and LI. Its not a matter of if. EV companies aren't going to have to worry about the Chinese Communist party reversing their policy decisions and you can bet they won't have to worry about competition from gasoline vehicles with Mao looking over them.  &amp;#x200B;  Example: in 2009 China said ""do nuclear power""  In 2009 China had 5 nuclear powerplants.

But I thought some of you who aren’t completely retarded might find my situation interesting and have a creative solution with reasonable level of risk.   My RH graph goes top left to bottom right for more than I’d like to admit, I used to play online poker instead of working for a handful of years in the good ‘ol days (that graph looks like stonk market so that’s nice), so trust that I am a true degenerate like most of you, but if you say don’t be a pussy go Tesla calls fuck off.  I’ve got a new kid and a new 2 unit home and gotta be responsible-ish, so I want an actual hedge not a yolo.   Was locked to refi at 3% with 4K credit, appraisal came up light so I need to save the cash to refi for a few months. In the mean time I’d like to set up a hedge against rising rates in case this upward move continues.   My basic bitch idea of first thing came to mind to hedge rates was to set up TLT puts ranging from deep ITM to OTM but I’m sure there is a better way. Also considered going long TMV etf, but I really haven’t thought it through because I just yesterday decided to use the funds to rollover to IRA before deadline (i had pulled the money to finish over budget rehab and have 60 days to return for rollover rather than pay tax/penalties/deadline to refi and deadline to replace funds for refi both expire end of week.) so I’m def still in the brainstorm phase of this, but wire should go through tomorrow into IRA and want the position in place ASAP in case rates hulk dick candle toward 1.25% in the next week.

Ringing the bell to open the trading day, multiple interviews/segments scheduled on the news and this.... https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/j59ur9/exciting_day_tomorrow/ The time for Hyliion's ""IPO"" (HYLN) has come. About Hyliion The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article. I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself: Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives. Investor Presentation As someone else wrote here, Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola. This is a good thing. The company's Investor Presentation can be found here. As can be shown in the presentation: 1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks. Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more. 2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone. One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries. 3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure. They are not in the business of being a ""gas station."" 4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells. They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry). 5) HYLN already has operational prototypes. 6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed. Renewable Natural Gas An article on FreightWaves provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is: Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas. RNG production is expected to double in the near future. Infrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe. For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800. Battery Management Supply Chain Two years ago, Hyliion acquired Gentherm's battery division to have its battery management supply chain in-house. Financials Future-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows: 2020: $1 million 2021: $8 million 2022: $344 million 2023: $1.0 billion 2024: $2.1 billion Not every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information. In this case, however, such information can be found in an SEC filing. Values and Governance Hyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board. It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders). It's quite another to demonstrate this. One of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board. In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board. This comparison extends to fraud prevention. Stock Price Disadvantages Being an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton. While Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space. Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN. Stock Price Advantages Even I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks. I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.). Evaluation HYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten. It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.

Worksport also owns IP/patents on the plastic molds, aluminum dies, processes, and associated tools in building their tonneau systems.  They are also currently the only company that offers a B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to customer) focused on the light truck market and offering solar-power generating tonneau cover. Their main competition, Truck Hero, makes up a large part of the market sector but does not offer a competitor to the TerraVis system.  **What’s so important about the TerraVis system?**  The TerraVis System is currently the only after-market vehicle accessory that generates, stores, and transfers solar-power to the vehicle or external batteries. Worksport holds the patent for the solar-tonneau system and is currently filing sub-patents for various components of the system.  Here are two videos of the system:  [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9JP8t8jvw)  [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lInSYqxM2gY&amp;t=1s)  **What’s the hype?**  Worksport announced they have entered into a $70 million OEM agreement with a U.S. based EV truck manufacturer to deliver their TerraVis system, with the likelihood of additional revenue moving forward. An official statement from the U.S. based EV Truck manufacturer on their purchase of the TerraVis tonneaus will be coming in mid-September.

(Buy the Rumor, Sell the News)**  There are currently three rumors on who Worksport is contracted with.  Rumor 1: Rivian (Amazon backed-company)  The CEO of Worksport, Steven Rossi has previously corresponded with Rivian’s founder RJ Scaring and Worksport’s parent company FNHI has posted several articles praising the company in what would seem like a mutually beneficial partnership.  Source: [https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/](https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/)  Rumor 2: Tesla  Elon Musk was quoted in late August stating that a solar-panel system on the Cybertruck would generate roughly 15 miles of range per day. This is an almost identical amount to what the TerraVis would provide. Additionally (and probably more compelling), Tesla will be holding it’s acclaimed “Battery Day” on September 22nd, directly in the window of when the partnership should be announced.

Source: [https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1301843534018945024](https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1301843534018945024)  Although these three are the strongest RUMORS, there are an array of other EV manufacturers that would still provide a huge upside for Worksport (Ford, GM, Lordstown, Nikola, etc.)  **Why buy now?**  CEO of Worksport tweeted this weekend to “be on the lookout” for another Tuesday announcement. So this upside play could happen quicker than expected.

What to bet on?   # Did Putin’s daughter die after taking the COVID-19 vaccine?  In August 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his country had approved a vaccine against COVID-19 and that the country would begin administering it to the public in the coming weeks. While Putin claimed the vaccine was safe – even noting that his daughter had taken it – the news of the vaccine raised concern among some in the scientific community who believed Russia may have taken it. shortcuts to speed up production of this vaccine.  In the days following the announcement, social media was inundated with views and fake news. A video supposedly showing Putin’s daughter being vaccinated, for example, actually showed a volunteer with no connection to the Russian president:  On August 15, another unverified allegation about Putin’s daughter began circulating on social media. The TorontoToday.net website published an article claiming that Putin’s daughter died after taking her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine:  &gt;*VLADIMIR PUTIN’S DAUGHTER DIES AFTER SECOND DOSE OF COVID VACCINE*   *VLADIMIR PUTIN’S DAUGHTER SUFFERED UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL RUSSIAN COVID VACCINE AND DIED IN MOSCOW.

Many retail investors are pilling into EV scams (NKLA) or overpriced SPACS like (SPAQ, HCAC, etc...). These companies don't have working vehicles, they depend on press releases to pump the stock and investors are constantly diluted for no reason.  Meanwhile, many institutional investors are securing positions in different companies that have a high chance in becoming big players in the EV revolution. Solid companies with defined plans, realistic goals, working products and real factories.  *July 09, 2020:* ([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/)) *Arcimoto, Inc.®, (NASDAQ: FUV) today announced the* ***entry into agreements with institutional investors relating to the sale of 1,370,000 shares of*** **its common stock at an above market offering price, pursuant to NASDAQ rules, of $7.30 per share.**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/72r2hivr8tg51.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146bdfbff1dcb25ab76d32c83affe7fb03dbaceb  **VARIETY OF PREMIUM VEHICLES**  * **Fun Utility Vehicle (FUV).** Designed for individual transportation (two-seat).

Designed for delivery. The vehicle has tons of space and can be used by restaurants do deliver large meals, by supermarkets to deliver groceries or by individual drivers that participate in the growing ""GIG ECONOMY"". [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BS5r_7710) * **Rapid Responder**. Designed for first responders, law enforcement and campus security. Improving response times and reducing carbon emissions all at once. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUNxakqvxw)  **BASIC INFORMATION**  * Located in Oregon.

They want to focus on the high margin vehicles and become profitable. * **If they get the ATVM loan they want to achieve a yearly output of 17,000-20,000 vehicles.** Given the current economic situation and stimulus money going everywhere, the CEO believes they have a high chance of getting the loan relatively quickly.  **FINAL HIGHLIGHTS**  * The company is loved by the current shareholders. **Companies with cult following can be very profitable.** Long term investors reduce the float because they hold for the long term giving the company a lot of momentum when positive news happen because nobody sells. * The company has been working very hard for over a decade to have a perfect working vehicle once they go into full scale production. The CEO is very smart and transparent. * They tested the production line with low volume (low thousands per year) to avoid unnecessary costs and production problems. **Now they are ready for the next step.** * Having someone as Munro planning the production and preventing mistakes once full scale production starts is extremely bullish.

In my back testing, I'm finding that I am first detecting the KODK volume pump with a relatively flat stonk price on Monday, July 27th at 12:50pm EST.    Because I'm looking across some 8k tickers at once in 10 min windows, I had to deploy it in a distributed architecture in the cloud. So I don't have code to share.  It would be too slow to run on one machine and even if I did share it, you'd still need quality, low latency data (not free shit like yFinance).    But I'm building an app around it so one could potentially get alerts while sitting on their bed with one sock on, jerking it while screaming at PRPL to do something on robinhood.  **TL;DR -** would you pay like $3.50/mo for an app which generates autistic stonk alerts?  **Wall of text details**  When I'm not losing money in the markets, I'm usually building SIEM's for my day job.  Basically, take  some vast pool of data, wire it up to stream in live, clean and parse it, then write custom logic to create alerts when shit happens - like say when Bob from accounting is downloading the company's sensitive data and uploading it into dropbox to leak this quarter's earnings.  I took the same concepts to design out a system to do the same with live stonk data, and other data related to stonks (social media, WSB daily discussion, whatever).  **The KODK Case Study**  In my KODK back test, the algorithm which I am running is fed 1 year of training data up to EOD Friday, July 24th and is then fed ""live"" data in 10 min snapshots on July 27th starting at pre-market trading.  It uses the training data to evaluate what's considered abnormal on the actual live day (or tested live day) of training so as to not give it the ability to see into the future and simulate running it live.    My algo arrived at a threshold of around 500k shares as being a volume anomaly for KODK.  By 12:50pm EST on July 27th, some 675k shares had been traded that day.    **BaCkTesTinG is ImPorTanT**  For the backtesting,  I wrote my own engine because I was too lazy to read the zipline docs and didn't need all the feature bloat.  I setup a DB which houses a few decades worth of properly cleaned  historical stock data to use as training data, and I paid out the ass for a quality firehose of 1 min tick data.  I can develop and simulate the algo locally then deploy the live streaming system + detection into my AWS environment.  For broader tests, I can also effectively ""replay"" whatever day I want in AWS across all of my detection systems.  **Autism as a Service (AaaS)** ™  While my back testing engine can either run locally or in AWS, the actual live AaaS platform I built around an AWS loosely coupled architecture so that I can easily scale it out as I come up with more signatures.    I did this intentionally for one primary reason:  \- I needed the ability to stream aggregate 10 min snapshots of market data across some 8k tickers, with low latency, feeding the data in and running it across multiple detection algorithms.    Basically, I needed a pub/sub data bus, with the detection algos running as their own subscribers against ""publishers"" of live data, with each algo able to scale out/scale in depending on load.  I didn't want to live in the hell that is managing my own Kafka deployment, or the auto scaling logic, when AWS could do that for me  In caveman terms-one script, one computer, too much data, too slow  At this point, I've got the back end built out, a DB to house my alerts, and have been focused on writing detection rules.  I don't have a website or app yet, but that's what I'll work on next.

They are incentivising keeping funds on-shore by pumping the equity markets. Buy large China stocks (BABA, JD).  [Inb4 pos or ban](https://imgur.com/1KZxxGD)  **The Economics**  China has a fixed exchange rate regime. Blah blah RMB internationalization, blah blah offshore RMB (which is actually settled in US dollars). This places it within line C of the policy trilemma (which says, you can't sustainably have all 3). Since 2005 to about 2017, the government was moving towards free capital mobility because of large amounts of exports which fed the national forex reserves. You bet billions of RMB left China, which the government didn't really like at first because that reduced domestic investment and would contribute to a weaker RMB. Basically, China was trying to do all 3 which works for a short while... until your forex reserves run out.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/g0nwsssoe7f51.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e46b6b2cfa12b351b30ff2c5567c2f9992e99b2  &amp;#x200B;  **The Current Problem**  The trade war has definitely been bad for China. I am going to try and skip politics, but basically foreign exchange reserves have been gapping down (official Chinese data is 100% fake). China is increasingly bellicose as well, which doesn't improve relations with trading partners who also buy with US dollars.  *You can't exchange for US dollars anymore.* For private citizens, you can only exchange for education purposes or travel . For companies, you need verification of invoices through both SAFE (State Administration of Foreign Exchange) and the tax offices. This used to take 24hrs, but is now taking 2-3 weeks for amounts &gt;$500k. China also has US dollar denominated bank accounts. But unfortunately, you can't take it in cash unless you have the reasons above. Chinese media is also branding holding US dollars as unpatriotic, so I'm afraid my $50k in digital money might be [subject to confiscation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corralito). If not, it's just fake money (can't take cash or wire out).  China has been brrrrrring to the pace of JPOW. Weapon of choice are muni and local bonds, which have been forced upon local banks. This creates a certain credit problem, but let's not worry about that until later.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36dd4665517ec7303b51aa1416517c9e0ea50bef  &amp;#x200B;  **The Solution**  China's pretty smart. All those RMB quotes are fake. You can try to get US dollars, but that is almost impossible now. Anyone who wants to buy RMB, contact me and we'll trade at the current price. So looking at the impossible triangle, free capital mobility has become nonexistent. In order to keep exchange rate stability (to avoid a sudden rush towards the door) and keep printing, free capital mobility needs to be 100% sacrificed.   How do you do that with a population that has seen the west and aspire to get out? You need to keep the money onshore. Thankfully, all Chinese are greedy and the equity markets are full of retailers that pump stocks up or down 10% per day. This is one of the reasons for the early [July State Council report](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/china-stocks-lead-rally-after-beijing-tells-people-to-buy---we-have-the-fed-to-juice-bull-markets-china-has-its-state-media.html) calling for everyone to buy stocks. Who's buying? Everyone. And if it drops, the national team takes over.   This creates a powerful incentive to fill the foreign reserves again. Foreigners (funds) would want to get in on the action. They will exchange their dollars for RMB, get those 20% gains, but eventually find out trying to get that money back into USD is impossible.   China has also been strengthening the RMB from 7.10 to 6.96 as of yesterday. Smart, because why would you want to sell an asset that's weakening? This is also a reason why China fears gold rallies - buying gold causes RMB to leave. Happily for the SAFE, some banks have stopped offering their paper gold products.   China will pump its domestic markets. Unless you have a Chinese account, the closest thing you can get to are mega names like Alibaba, JD and Tencent. I would avoid touching too small companies because of LK coffee problems.   Oh yeah the trade war? Well, pussies don't make money.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1391085.0|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8ii1ll3fVq9CwXaCGYG-Eae1SajB4jEuFjtCU1HXQV0.jpg|Why China is Pumping China Stocks|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i47s95/why_china_is_pumping_china_stocks/|no_ads|0.0|{'g0nwsssoe7f51': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'g0nwsssoe7f51', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g0nwsssoe7f51.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f866af4863dad7d49b4f8ab7e6c68f05e86fc64e', 'x': 108, 'y': 97}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g0nwsssoe7f51.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d07b0ecc5b69e49fe8ada6fc2468af729b64ebaa', 'x': 216, 'y': 195}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g0nwsssoe7f51.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a393dab0f65284100a308e2dc0c98e100ceb1fbd', 'x': 320, 'y': 290}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g0nwsssoe7f51.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e46b6b2cfa12b351b30ff2c5567c2f9992e99b2', 'x': 580, 'y': 526}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'maul8aope7f51': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'maul8aope7f51', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=329dc4a53fee6596272c16852135f82bd377eb52', 'x': 108, 'y': 65}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11519ba84e64c4a1b88c47a19f8e2d568f079d06', 'x': 216, 'y': 130}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ef4b871c02457820aea50fc05a47164d595884e', 'x': 320, 'y': 193}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cc4c533a1c55a8190b44abc1c1fce151af26c0b', 'x': 640, 'y': 386}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6042c41010770b77578d0f8d470379e05bc6af', 'x': 960, 'y': 579}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60003ec0707469e1501355e1bac54eb633a725fc', 'x': 1080, 'y': 651}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/maul8aope7f51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36dd4665517ec7303b51aa1416517c9e0ea50bef', 'x': 1200, 'y': 724}, 'status': 'valid'}}|126.0|140.0|||||||||||||||||||2020-08-05|WIRE

If this is wrong, please feel free to delete my post but don't ban me :(((   I'm 21 from Vietnam and our money has little value, 500usd is like average monthly salary here. It's pretty hard to access US stock trading from where I'm from. I got a TDA account, they allow foreign account, then ask a friend of mine in the US to fund it and I send him money over Paypal or Transferwise. My countries doesn't even allow bank wire to fund international investing.    I started in Feb with the SPCE crazed, missed TSLA, MSFT due to TDA handling my account creation a bit too long (was my fault at first but their handling was the main problem). Proceed to make big with SPCE in a week, I turn 2k into 6k and it was amazing, that's like a year of salary for an average person here and still being in uni that was a dream for me. I work pretty hard to make money here, part time and trying to open my own company and making 6k in such a short amount of time was crazy.    I did spent a few years learning before I was 18 (to be allowed to create an account). Wanted to get in heavy on AMD when they were sub 2 (I study Computer Engineer and love PC so I kinda felt how big Ryzen was) but didn't have the chance.    So after SPCE was around Feb 20 and the market started crashing, lost a lot to sub 1k then I moved to SPY put and made back to 3k.   Then lost a bunch on The Witching. Down to 300 and proceed to lose them with put when market shoot back up. Finally some friend decided they wanna give it a go and invest some money with me trading and he'll just watch.  Having learnt a bunch from my past experience, I managed to turn his 500 into 4000 with pennystock and I get to keep 2000 which was back to even. Took a lot of good risk management and making multiple small smart play.   That was a month ago, now I'm down to 800 but I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot better compares to when I start.   Most of the lost was due to lack of day trading with penny stock and some momentum options play gone wrong.   My biggest mistake and biggest gainer was both due to going too big on a position. I'm learning to control that.   Anw, that was a long rant, I never really share these things since there's no one around me that I can talk about this. All I hear people say is that I'm gambling, which might seems like it looking at my history but I kinda think it's justified right now due to never before seen volatility.   I learnt a lot and feel excited for my trading future but man the losses take their tolls. Probably gonna finish uni next year and try to get my company of the ground while doing small investing. Learning about the market, news and general financial, business helped me a lot with my career I feel.   Hope this somehow answer your question and good luck to us all. At the end of the day I just want everyone to live more comfortably with their side income and seeing the loss porn might be hilarious but there's always a person behind those loss as well as their family. It's fine if you lose 100k while sitting on millions but man some adults just scares me and I'm grateful to learn from their mistakes.   I want to make 25k before the end of next year so I can day trade. Just making 100 usd a day would allow me to fund my company and let my parents retire soon especially during this harsh Covid time.    Vietnam was free of covid for a month or two but just yesterday we have emergency news that a case popped up and spread.   Sorry for my long rant, hope you all enjoy your weekend and get those tendies next week.

Im a non US citizen and living outside the US. Mostly a long term investor (few/many years) but sometimes do swing/position trading (few weeks/months).   Im looking at tradestation global (tie up of trade station and IB) (no maint. &amp; withdrawal fees, $1.5 comm.) and td ameritrade (no maintenance but $7 comm. &amp; $25 withdrawal fees), Sofi ($0 comm. &amp; withdrawal fees but not sure about spreads, maintance fee) but you can suggest others.

It will go down as one of the historically most brazen stock frauds ever. Securities fraud, market manipulation, accounting fraud, wire fraud, fraudulent real estate transactions, large scale identity theft, and it goes on and on. Every day there is fresh skullduggery uncovered... it's a fast moving case. If you aren't familiar with this already just google it there is so much in depth information from so many different sources.  100% chance this thing is imploding. Nobody with a fully functional brain who did at least 10 minutes of research would disagree with that statement.  The question is when and how do you make money from this information.   You would think it would be easy to answer but it hasn't been so far.  The stock tanked from a high of 45 or so when the short sellers started piling in, down to 27 or so, and then mysteriously rocketed back to 42. Allegations are that GSX is just maxing out what cash they have left on repurchases, recalling class B shares, and a Chinese brokerage called Tiger pulled all borrow shares to prevent further short selling. Some combination of these things and momentum trading created a short squeeze, keeping this trash afloat a bit longer  Why not just buy OTM puts? That has a lot of merit because as the stock gained 60% in price, puts actually GAINED value (option market telling you what the equity market won't).  Problem is we just don't know what expiry for said puts, since we don't know how long it will last. Other major problem is when this hits the inevitable luckin coffee style 80% down in 5 seconds, it will be halted then our puts are halted too. Risk exists that puts can expire worthless in some combination of halting and delisting scenario.   Thats why shorting these shares is the way to go, especially if you are cash gang in any way. I didn't believe the rally like the flamingest of bears that I am, so I kept a bunch of cash on the sidelines. I thought everything was crazy overbought, and the spike in corona cases of the lockdown lifting would plunge us again. Now it's hard to jump back in at these valuations because you know the second you do top is in.   Shorting it is just getting on the waiting list for a 90% gain. Your number might be called today, or in a few weeks, or even in a month. But it will be called, and that is unmistakable. If you have your capital tied up in calls, thats cool, don't change anything, every call is probably gonna be a 10 bagger whereas we are only looking at a slightly less than 2 bagger here. But for the cautious skeptic, potentially closeted bear cub, may 15 SPY150p type gang, who have money left on the sidelines, there is no reason not to.  This will disqualify many of you using robinhood, and some of you who are using real brokerages. There just aren't many shares to short left. I check back every day to see if there are more available, and just keep adding and adding.   This is financial advice and it literally will go tits up (the China! fraud).   Positions: short 1400 shares GSX at 37.36|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1258528.0|public|confidence|self|Cash Gang Short GSX|0.0|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz1yj9/cash_gang_short_gsx/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||True|||||||||||||2020-06-08|WIRE

This Phase 2 study, being conducted by Moderna under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application, will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. The Company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Each participant will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 μg or a 100 μg dose at both vaccinations. Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination. Given the 25 μg and 100 μg dose levels in the Phase 1 study showed neutralizing antibody titers at or above convalescent sera and were generally well tolerated, the Company has decided not to pursue the 250 μg dose level in the Phase 2 study.

But you are a raging bull and just couldn’t muster up enough gayness to buy puts. Well pop a handful of skittles and taste the rainbow with $CKLD. This CCP house of cards is days away from going tits up and I’ll tell you why. They mass produce traditional Chinese Medical therapies. Yes like bat soup. But the CFO of this dog, Sum Ting Wong, is balls deep in sourcing Bok Choy for literally all of their products. No bats. No rats. No Dog Anus. No Feline Ovaries. And yes, no Eel Semen. That shits expensive. Bok Choy is cheap as fuck and this dude is no country bumpkin rice farmer. He knows these therapies are total bullshit so what’s the difference between a Goat Testy and a vegetable, right? You may be asking yourself, how does this guy know this and why should I trust him with my tendies? I’ll tell you why. Ever hear of the German journalist Bastian Obermayer? Yes that guy. The guy who broke the Panama Papers. See back in the day when Sum Ting Wong was in college, he found himself struggling financially as many students do. And as many students do, he did some things he’s not proud of. Obermayer was in Shanghai studying at the same University. Wong was about 500 yuan short of making rent for his apartment and was sobbing dragon sized tears to Bastian about it. Now we all know Germans are into some sick shit so Obermayer asked Wong “uza eever heer uva bukkake?” Wong was basically like of course you crazy German fuck, I’m Asian we all know about that crazy shit. Well it just so happened that Obermayer knew the founder of JM Productions, Jeff Steward, and told Wong they pay 500 yuan to be in one of their videos. Wong being desperate, agreed. So we have Bok Choy, Bukkake, Panama Papers but if that’s not enough, consider this. Jeff Steward was up late recently waiting for his Ambien to kick in and saw Wong on Mad Money pumping up some fake Bat Flu remedy. Recognizing him from the video from years ago he called him and told him he would go to the press with the Bukkake video if he didn’t wire 10,000,000 by Tuesday. My bet is Wong jumps off the top of their headquarters in Shanghai in fear of being publicly humiliated.

A lot of small businesses have been shut down and are forced to lay off workers  \----The other crisis is the Wall Street crisis, but arguably even more important is the $100 trillion credit market because no one wants to lend in these uncertain times.  **FED** **&amp; U.S Treasury**  Basically from Main Street to Wall Street people need money. Incoming the FED. To solve these 2 crises, the FED’s plan is to print money. Incoming, the U.S. Treasury. Also, technically it’s not money. It's just currency because it's based on debt not value. While it’s crazy the FED is allowed to just create money out of thin air, my point here is that the Fed will be printing trillions of dollars.  Enter Quantitative Easing (technical term for printing massive amounts of money. Here’s the FED chairman of MN, Neel Kashkari “ [there is an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-23/coronavirus-fed-s-infinite-cash-tested-in-world-of-leverage). We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there's enough cash in the banking system.” WTH!!!  The Fed has a mandate from the US government; maximize employment, keep prices stable, and keep interest rates moderate. So ever since the Fed was created more than 100 years ago it added or removed the money from the economy, mostly in small quantities to keep prices stable over time; though the Fed has ended up adding a huge amount of money which is why we have inflation. [Here’s the US Money Supply M2](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2) last 25 years. From $286B to now $17,176B in 25 years.  **Inflations &amp; Hyper-inflation.**  In theory as more money gets added to the economy, prices go up because each dollar buys less. In reality it's more complicated because the population grows, and because new dollars don't get spread evenly throughout the economy.  People in the US have gotten used to gradual inflation in consumer prices usually about 2% a year. The Fed has worked hard to maintain this moderate rate of inflation for decades. Even moderate inflation comes with its own problems.  What nobody wants is hyperinflation. That's what happens when the central bank prints too much money too fast. That happened in the [paradise of Venezuela](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2019/01/01/venezuelas-hyperinflation-hits-80000-per-year-in-2018/#56c0c89f4572). Corruption and stupid government policies wrecked the economy. Eventually, the government couldn't raise enough their taxes so they just printed more currency to pay for stuff. That made the value of the Venezuelan currency plunged. At its peak inflation, reached more than a million percent. The well educated and once middle-class were wiped out to the point [it’s cheaper to use cash than toilet paper.](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/08/in-venezuela-it-s-cheaper-to-use-cash-than-toilet-paper.html)  **QE – a history lesson 2008**  Federal Reserve is aware of this danger. Doing quantitative easing or QE is risky. The Fed has done several QE injections before. From 2008 to 2011 they eased about $4 trillion new dollars into the economy to deal with some of the fallout from the recession.  The good news was consumers did not see massive inflation, [the consumer price index,](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html) which tracks the prices of consumer saw a roughly normal amount of inflation 1 to 2% year which means prices increased by just under 19% over the last 11 years.  The bad news was some prices don't get tracked by the consumer price index. I'm talking about asset prices like the stock market, high-end art, and other thing rich people investing in.  QE did cause [inflation and asset prices massive inflation](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/where-is-inflation-hiding-in-asset-prices/). [The US stock market grew by a whopping 225](https://mises.org/wire/fed-driven-asset-price-inflation-means-you-can-now-buy-less-house-you-could)% in 11 years. All that happened because of the way the Fed did their QE.  When the Fed printed money out of thin air, they used it to buy assets whose prices have fallen things like stocks, corporate bonds, collateralized debt obligations which included home mortgage loans repackaged in complex ways. The value of all those assets had balloons before 2008 and then the balloons popped.  When the Fed did QE, it pumped new money specifically into those assets. Between 2008 and 2011 the Fed printed about $4 trillion of new currency which again ended up inflating asset prices but not really the price of consumer goods.  So people who already had enough money to invest in stocks and other assets got richer, while everyone else stayed roughly the same. And that's one reason why the wealth gap in the US has increased. Just look at the gap [from 201 to 2016](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/).  **COVID 19**  Now with the 2020 coronavirus, the Fed doing multiple rounds of quantitative easing. [They've already announced $700 billion in bond purchases](https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-reserve-slashes-rates-launches-700-billion-quantitative/story?id=69610447) and by the time this economic crisis is over, [Total QE could be in the ballpark of $5 trillion.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/upshot/coronavirus-fed-extraordinary-response.html)  It's 20 times more than the $250 billion given to individuals in the stimulus checks. Of course the stimulus checks are not from the Fed. Those checks are part of the government's recent $2 trillions stimulus package, but ultimately it's all to be paid for by printing money.  With this new QE, the Fed has to be careful or we could see the same kind of asset inflation we saw a decade ago, which mainly help the rich get richer while everyone else's money lost value.  But……. “ it’s different this time.  **FED bailing out:**  [I’ll summarized: ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm)Here’s what the FED’s buying:  1.) Treasury Securities -basically government bonds and that keeps interest rates low  2.) Mortgage-backed securities( repackaging of real estate mortgages which led to massive problems in 2008, but…… this time it’s different ( being sarcastic).  3.) corporate bonds, basically the debt of large corporations. So this is a type of Wall Street bailout  4.) Exchange-traded funds, which are listed on the stock market, which is another type of Wall Street bailout meant to make the stock market go back up.  So all that sounds roughly the same as a decade ago. But as they say, if you do the same thing over and over again “It will be different this time I swear”.  5.) But the Fed has some new programs [this time to using QE to support states and citie](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/09/fed-to-buy-municipal-debt-178222)s that need to quickly raise money by issuing bonds.

But where am I supposed to ask?   I have a margin account at interactive brokers and most of the equity in the account was from transferring shares of stock from another broker into IB. I had about $250k net liquidity in the account.  So last week for totally legit reasons I needed about $100k cash **fast**, so I figured I would just withdraw that much cash from the account on margin to take advantage of those sweet 1.5% margin rates. I go to set up the wire but the max I can withdraw is around $60k. What gives?  Turns out there's an SMA account that can't ever go below zero and mine only had $60k in it. That looks a lot like the cash I seeded the account with plus unrealized gains over the past couple years, which is what the SMA is, but it doesn't look like it accounts for all the shares I transferred in! If instead of transferring shares I sold the shares in the other broker, transferred cash in instead, then immediately purchased those same shares, I'd have 1/2 the value of the shares in the SMA and the SMA would probably be over $150k!  Is IB doing the right thing here?

(NYSE: SPCE) (“Virgin Galactic” or “the Company”) and The Spaceship Company (“TSC”) today announced the successful completion of its first SpaceShipTwo test flight from Spaceport America.  This glide flight marks the inaugural solo flight of VSS Unity in New Mexico and as such is an important flight test milestone in preparation for commercial service.  On SpaceShipTwo’s flight deck were Dave Mackay and CJ Sturckow who, together with the team in Mission Control, executed some of the key elements of a spaceflight profile. These included take-off and landing along with high-altitude release from the mothership, VMS Eve, which was piloted by Michael Masucci and Kelly Latimer.  The flight took off from the Spaceport America runway, with VSS Unity attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve. The vehicles climbed to an altitude of 50,000ft before Unity was released, at which point VSS Unity flew freely for the first time in New Mexico airspace. The spaceship achieved a glide speed of Mach 0.70 and completed multiple test-points, before touching back down smoothly for a runway landing at Spaceport America.  This test flight was conducted under a set of stringent operational protocols to ensure safety against COVID-19. Its successful execution was made possible by a concerted effort to redesign all the operational elements required for safe flight test while meeting new health and wellness protocols. These protocols include changes to the work areas and procedures to enforce social distancing as advised by state guidelines as well as universal mask usage.  This flight milestone represents a major achievement which has been in the planning since SpaceShipTwo relocated to Virgin Galactic’s New Mexico commercial headquarters in February. Virgin Galactic also fully concluded the relocation of its spaceline operations team and their families to New Mexico.  This glide flight provided the first opportunity to test all the components required to fly the carrier aircraft and spaceship in glide configuration, from a new home base and in new airspace. Dave and CJ performed a series of maneuvers with VSS Unity designed to gather data about performance and handling qualities in order to enhance our aerodynamic modeling and verify against similar maneuvers that were performed earlier in Unity’s test flight program. The flight test also provided an opportunity for the pilots and spaceflight operations team to continue familiarisation with the new airspace around the Gateway to Space and a chance to capture valuable in-flight data and conduct further pilot training.  Friday’s flight successfully completed all test objectives. Virgin Galactic would like to express its thanks to New Mexico Spaceport Authority (NMSA), the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Albuquerque Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and the FAA Air Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque for smooth coordination and efficient integration.  Preparation for the next flight will now begin, starting with an in depth analysis of today’s flight data.  George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company said, “I’d like to congratulate our team for reaching this flight milestone, especially during these challenging times. I am grateful for the commitment displayed by everyone involved, not only in helping to support relief efforts in both New Mexico and California, but also for the dedication and creativity which will allow us to continue safely towards our goal of commercial launch.”  “Today’s VSS Unity flight is another exciting milestone for Virgin Galactic's progress in New Mexico. We are extremely happy and proud of Virgin Galactic, not only for today’s success but also for the exceptional way they have integrated into NM and supported the region and State during this stressful time dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Spaceport America and Virgin Galactic have adhered to new guidelines set by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to include social distancing and wearing masks. A big thank you to our foundational partner at Spaceport America!” said Dan Hicks, Executive Director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority.

There will be no upfront out-of-pocket costs to people who receive an order for a test through a doctor or healthcare provider, including telemedicine providers.  Antibody blood tests offered by LabCorp are administered across the U.S. at tens of thousands of doctors’ offices and at LabCorp’s nearly 2,000 patient service centers, including LabCorp at Walgreens locations. Results will be available to the ordering healthcare provider within 1-3 days after the date of specimen pick up. They are also available to patients in the LabCorp Patient™ mobile app.  Adam Schechter, president and CEO of LabCorp, said: “We are bringing the full force of LabCorp’s science and testing capabilities to serve individuals across the U.S. whether they had the virus or believe they have the virus. We stand with all Americans, healthcare workers, and those on the frontlines who are helping people in need.”  Richard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, said: “COVID-19 response requires collaboration across industries and sectors, and we’re pleased to further our relationship with LabCorp in order to improve access to COVID-19 and antibody testing in many of the communities we serve. By continuing to expand our testing efforts and resources, together we’ll play a critical role in helping to keep our communities healthy and enabling more Americans to return to work once they can do so safely.”  LabCorp began antibody blood testing on a limited basis to high-priority healthcare workers in late-March and currently has capacity to perform over 50,000 antibody tests per day. By mid-May, LabCorp expects to be able to perform 200,000 tests per day as more tests and testing platforms receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).  The COVID-19 antibody blood tests detect the presence of antibodies to the virus and can help identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus. While antibody tests are helpful to understand if an individual has developed antibodies and a potential immune response, antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude infection. Knowing a patient’s results might be useful in the determination of important decisions, such as the ability for hospital staff to care for patients.  These tests have not been reviewed by the FDA but are being offered by LabCorp in accordance with the public health emergency guidance issued by the FDA on March 16.  LabCorp is committed to providing critical information regarding COVID-19. Updates related to LabCorp’s response are available on LabCorp’s COVID-19 microsite.

Pierre is a world class chef who immigrated to USA from France. You used to make the best croissants in the world before Corona hit the economy. Your restaurants have a burn rate of about $35,000 per week while they sit empty.   Meanwhile, JPow, and Jamie Dimon are having a meeting at the Federal Reserve. Trump phones in. JPow puts him on speaker. Trump is complaining that he can't go bowling or get his face tattooed on his ass. He has planned this tattoo for six months. He needs it now. JPow and Mr. Dimon sigh, and decide to fund a few small businesses so that Trump can go bowling and get a tattoo.   Before Trump called in, JPow and Mr. Dimon were working on a stimulus plan. They were reviewing Pierre's relief loan application. JPow noted how tasty Pierre's croissants were. Mr. Dimon liked how hot the waitresses are. JPow approved Pierre for a loan of $75 and Mr. Dimon agreed. They were two seconds away from transferring Pierre $75, but the phone call from Trump distracted them.   After the call with Trump, JPow and Mr. Dimon quickly fund bowling alleys and tattoo parlours in Georgia. Then they pick up a new application. It is a hedge fund requesting $587 billion. Mr. Dimon gets hard. He sees that this fund YOLO'd a trillion dollars on Croissant Bonds (CBs). CBs were the hottest financial product on the street. Of course that was before Corona. Mr. Dimon likes the investing style of this fund and quickly approves them for the $587 billion. The fund gets the wire transfer right away. THE END.   EPILOGUE:   Pierre never receives the loan he applied for. He loses his restaurants and becomes homeless. All of his staff become homeless too.   After the hedge fund received their $587 billion they simply bought more CBs. Their initial losses stemmed from CBs, but the hedge fund manager claimed that ""People will always need croissants, so we expect a V shaped recovery"".

Echostar (SATS) owns HughesNet which provides satellite internet to residential customers in the US and Latin America. Together with their main competitor, Viasat, they control 100% of the US residential satellite internet market (duopolies are usually a good thing).  **I believe SATS is likely going to benefit from the covid-19 lock-downs as people consume more internet by staying at home watching Netflix, playing video games and scrolling Instagram/ Reddit. The monthly plans have data caps so if you want more internet you have to increase your plan.**  Contrary to what you urban city-folk might think, many Americans (20 million households) live in areas where the only wire-line internet option is DSL. Those customers who want faster internet are willing to pay $60-80 for satellite internet via Echostar or Viasat to get download speeds of 20 mbps which is shockingly better than the main DSL offerings in the areas (DSL is $40-80 per month).  SATS has grown broadband subscribers and revenue at a &gt;10% growth rate over the last 6 years and profit has grown faster so it's a growing industry. SATS and Viasat combined only serve 2 million households out of a 20 million household addressable market so there's plenty of room for growth.  **Why SATS over VSAT? Well, for starters, SATS is currently valued at just 5x EBITDA vs satellite peers at 7-8x and VSAT at &gt;10x despite better growth. Second, SATS has $25 in cash per share compared to a stock price of $31 so there is zero bankruptcy or solvency risk. VSAT on the other hand has high leverage.**  **The stock was $45 two months ago (compared to $31 today) and I think it will be at least $40 in 3-6 months once people realize this pandemic is actually positive for Echostar's business.**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1102452.0|public|confidence|self|Buy Calls on Echostar ($SATS) - Buying now is the equivalent of going back in time 2 months ago and buying calls on Netflix / Zoom|0.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g13vq0/buy_calls_on_echostar_sats_buying_now_is_the/|no_ads|0.0||||1586865252.0||||||||||||||||||2020-04-14|WIRE

Let's start with a clipped quote from [this article](https://mises.org/wire/why-world-has-dollar-shortage-despite-massive-fed-action).   &gt;The Federal Reserve has identified the Achilles heel of the world economy: the enormous global shortage of dollars. The global dollar shortage is estimated to be $13 trillion now \[...\]    In the past 20 years, dollar-denominated debt in emerging and developed economies, led by China, has exploded. \[...\] Those countries now face more than $2 trillion of dollar-denominated maturities in the next two years and, in addition, the fall in exports, GDP and the price of commodities has generated a massive hole in dollar revenues for most economies.   If we take the US dollar reserves of the most indebted countries and deduct the outstanding liabilities with the estimated foreign exchange revenues in this crisis … The global dollar shortage may rise from 13 trillions of dollars in March 2020 to $ 20 trillion in December … And that is if we do not estimate a lasting global recession.  So other countries have massive amounts of dollar-denominated bonds, and there aren't enough dollars floating around out there to pay up by the time they come due.  If you have a debt of dollars that you default on, suddenly those dollars... just don't exist. And what happens to the dollar when there are fewer of them? It becomes more valuable.   Because the Fed anticipates these defaults, it knows that pretty soon the world will have a lot fewer dollars in it. This gives the Fed room to print extra money without actually causing the value of the dollar to depreciate as much as one might expect.   Adding to that, everyone else has been turning their money printers on as well, and their printers are even faster than ours. If they were to turn on their money printers and the Fed didn't, that would quickly bump up the relative strength of the dollar. But isn't a strong dollar good? You can buy more condoms for your wife's boyfriend with the same amount of money now, right? Not so fast.   Generally speaking, as the value of the dollar goes uppies, stonks go downsies. Come have a three-course lunch me with me, I just got my allowance from your mom:  * Course one: 1 Wendy's Baconator costs $1 * Course two: The dollar just got a buff because the other countries turned on their printers and are about to throw their dollar-denominated debts on a grill, so now 1 Baconator just went from costing $1 to only costing $0.65 * Course three: In this analogy, 1 Baconator=1 stonk  A strong dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It means imported goods get cheaper for Americans, but US exports are harder for other countries to afford, and US companies that do business elsewhere get cucked when their foreign operations are getting paid in the equivalent of cowrie shells and used panties. The Fed *wants* to keep the dollar down. This is intentional.   So to all the people predicting $20 loaves of bread, shut the fuck up already.   And to all the people who know more than me, call me out. Like I said, I'm just a retard learning how to autate.

Dollars are now the cheapest to borrow in history in Europe and yet no one wants them. Ecuador traded 300 million in gold for dollars. Let that sink all you peter Schiff followers (I detest that fucking guy he’s a charlatan in the financial markets). The second swap line was setup for the boj because the dollar is in such demand people would rather use jgbs to swap for dollars then the bojs qe. I think these ivory tower prince and princess created such a convoluted mess for themselves by just piling on debt for the last decade and they have no idea how to fix it.       Right now the euro sits at 1.09 the 20 year trendline is around 1.085 and there’s nothing but air under 1.10. At some point as the dollar keeps going this month the fed is just going to step in and hammer it because they’re out of ideas. Goldman thinks it happens 5% above the highs and honestly I’m atleast taking out my initial bet maybe more there because I have a feeling theyre right. Both swap lines were setup for 6 months so I don’t think this dollar situation is over for the year but I do think this is going to be an ugly month. Will the ecb act maybe after April 17th when they get trade surplus data and the ivory tower princess sees just what a big problem she has on her hands. Feds fighting the market and the market always wins.

The event will sell tickets to host a live audience of approximately 2,500 people, and will also be live streamed, available online through pay-per-view.  You can learn more about it by visiting **[wallstreetbets.net](https://wallstreetbets.net)**  #**Why will it be in Texas?**  ESA is the newest and biggest Esports venue in the US.  It’s a facility that was built specifically for esports and has all the latest technology and infrastructure which is needed to host this type of event.   #**Is it real**?  Yes.

How can I apply?**  We will open up contestant applications in the coming weeks along with any requirements (relevant citizenship, 18 years old, etc…).  At that point we will also list out the rules and criteria which will used for the selection.  There will be “qualifier rounds” which will be fully transparent and open to the public to watch.  At the end of the process, we will have the final contestants for the WSB Championship.  Contestants will deposit a predetermined amount of money into a personal broker account which will be used for the competition.  Anything they make (or lose) during the competition will be theirs, in addition to the prize money awarded to the winner.  #**What’s the prize?**  The prize will be big, between 6 and 7 figures.  The final amount will be announced in the coming weeks.  #**How are you paying for it?**  The prize money is coming from the primary sponsor of the event, [True Trading Group]( https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&amp;cp=30).  This has been mentioned in all the press releases linked above:   &gt; True Trading Group (TTG) will provide the proceeds for the WSB Championship prize.  #**What about the beer virus?**  We’re seriously hoping that COVID-19 is under control by October, in which case we will proceed with the live audience.  But if there are any sort of restrictions in place by then, the entire event will also be streamed online.  #**Do you have a lawyer?**  Yes.

Since stock investing is a straightforward concept, we'll build upon that to explain how options trading works. If you prefer to read a version with inline images, that can be found [here](https://www.karma.fm/p/53IhuQS/stocks-and-options-for-dummies).  ## Going ""Long"" on Stocks  Going ""long"" on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up. Up = good, down = bad.  When you buy a share, you create a sort of **contract** with a stock exchange. This contract is stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.  The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mack Doodle, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:  [https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png)  ## Shorting a stock  Shorting a stock is the opposite ""going long"". If the price goes down when you're holding a short position, your profits go up.  Here's how shorting works¹: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can effectively borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference.  *¹: Technically, it's a bit more complicated. The above simplification is a heuristic I use because it's conceptually accurate. You actually borrow stock, not cash. If you short 100 shares of $TSLA, the broker lets you borrow 100 shares from someone else's account and sells them on your behalf, finally giving you the cash. You're then on the hook for those 100 shares at some point in the future - you have to cover your short position. If TSLA goes down, you can buy them at a lower price and make money on that delta.*  When you're short and price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.     The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mack Doodle, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:  [https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png](https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png)  Short means ""up is bad; down is good"". Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:     &gt;Contract Type: Purchase Stock   ----------------------------   Wallet ID: Mack Doodle   Ticker symbol: $FOO   Price at time of contract creation: $100   Price at time of contract execution: $100   Number of shares: 1   Buying or selling: Buying   Date contract signed: Just now   Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)  ## Limit and Stop Orders  The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy stop order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell stop order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Contract Type: Buy Stop Order   ----------------------------   Wallet ID: Bobby Ronson   Ticker symbol: $FOO   Price at time of contract creation: $100   Price at time of contract execution: $120 \[New!\]   Number of shares: 1   Buying or selling: Buying   Date contract signed: Just now   Date contract executed: TBD (by price action) \[New!\]  This contract, in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:     [https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png](https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png)  Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.     This isn't commonly used by retail investors (like you and me), but this concept is used frequently by quant/algo funds.  ## Options  An option is a slightly more complex instrument.  The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value *by a specific time*, you profit. Note the added dimension of gameplay - a time limit. This compresses your confidence down into a timeframe, which translates to much higher risk, and also much higher reward. I think of options as facilitating *aggressive investing* \- not just gambling. Though I think all investing becomes gambling at *some* timescale.  ### Going long with a call option  Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share - or *call it into your wallet* \- for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the options game looks like:  [https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png](https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png)  ### Going short with a put option  Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the relatively small cost of the option.  Note that if the price never hits break-even, you're responsible for your loss of principal; it's not like there's no downside.  [https://i.imgur.com/6klYYGN.png](https://i.imgur.com/6klYYGN.png)  Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments. They're higher up on the value funnel; they're more volatile; there's more potential for dramatic gains and losses:  [https://i.imgur.com/F0fhVeC.png](https://i.imgur.com/F0fhVeC.png)  Here's what an option contract looks like:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Contract Type: Buy Call Option   ----------------------------   Wallet ID: Mack Doodle   Ticker symbol: $FOO   Price at time of contract creation: $100   Price at time of contract execution: $120 \[""strike price""\]   Number of shares: 100 \[1 contract = 100 shares\]   Buying or selling: ""Buying"" \[Buying a call option = long\]   Date contract signed: Just now   Date contract executed: TBD \[See Note\]   Date contract expires: November 5th \[New!\]   Option price: $200 \[New!\]  Once you hold an option contract, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.     Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla.  Let's suppose that I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and that I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. At the time of this writing, $TSLA was trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:  **Game 1: Going long with stocks**  * I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares * My ""break even"" is at a share price of just over $221 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me. * Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose $10,000. * Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 45 or \~$8,000 (or potentially much more - stocks have no time limits) * My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.  &amp;#x200B;  **Game 2: Going long with options**  The $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:  [https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png](https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png)  &amp;#x200B;  * I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are) * My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~$256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I'm golden. * Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose the $10,000 option contract. * Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 by December and I earn (400–225) \* 285 or \~$50,000 * My max loss is $10,000–100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.  Options magnify my potential reward while also magnifying the potential for losses; Tesla dipping 20% means I lose 100% of my principal.     Here's my ""contract"", in this case:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Contract Type: Buy Call Option   ----------------------------   Wallet ID: Mack Doodle   Ticker symbol: $TSLA   Price at time of contract creation: $221   Price at time of contract execution: $225 \[""strike price""\]   Number of shares: 285   Buying or selling: ""Buying"" \[Buying a call option = long\]   Date contract signed: Just now   Date contract executed: TBD   Date contract expires: December 20th   Option price: $10,000  That's about it! Keep in mind that this is a game, and our nationalized financial industry employs some of the most clever and greedy gamblers out there. The house generally wins, but just like poker - with the right mental models, discipline, and risk appetite, you can come out far ahead. It's not unlike poker in that self-education and exercise translate to vastly improved odds at the table.  *Note: If you have any feedback or would like to improve this for others, drop a comment below!*"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1033336.0|public|confidence|self|A Brief Introduction To Stocks And Options For My Fellow Degenerates|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flzwq3/a_brief_introduction_to_stocks_and_options_for_my/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||||||||2020-03-20|WIRE

I am a very educated american business man of high stature from North Caroline . And have patronage over 158 million in american backed bank certificates. I will educate you about the American million bank certificate system. Many people ask me how I have received the right of being such high stature here are my top 4 tips.  1. MEDITATION: Meditation is key to being successful if you do not meditate for at least 5 hours a day your body will be unconnected with your mind and will not allow you to achieve success.  2. SLEEP: Sleep is also very important your body need sleep to be successful. If you do not get at least 10 hours of sleep every day you will fail in life. Sleep gives us energy to move and live. 3. GYM: Exercise is very important you should wake up every morning at 5:30 and get a gym session in. Going to the gym gets you ready for the day and connects your mind to Allah.  4. READING: You need to read at least 4 hours a day so you could be educated for what life brings to you. Read books like rich dad poor dad and Bill gates autobiography.   Here is a excerpt from one of my favorite books    What Happened  Book by Hillary Clinton  Securities markets in the United States began with speculative trading in issues of the new government. In 1791, the country's first stock exchange was established in Philadelphia, the leading city in domestic and foreign trade. An exchange in New York was set up in 1792, when 24 merchants and brokers decided to charge commissions while acting as agents for other persons, and to give preference to each other in their negotiations. They did much of their trading under a tree at 68 Wall Street.  Government securities formed the basis of the early trading. Stocks of banks and insurance companies added to the volume of transactions. The building of roads and canals brought more securities to the market. In 1817, the New York brokers decided to organize formally as the New York Stock and Exchange Board. Thereafter, the stock market grew with the industrialization of the country. In 1863, the New York Stock Exchange adopted its present name. During the Civil War, additional exchanges were organized, one of them the forerunner of the present American Stock Exchange, the second largest stock market in the country for a long time.   Day Trading, as we know it, has been around for more than a century. Today, we have electronics to help, but the concept of buying and selling securities by the public goes back to the late years of the 19th century. Small businesses were set up in major cities across the country where people could go to make “plays” in the market. These were affectionately known as “bucket shops.” The players would all contribute money into the common “bucket.” The pool of money was then used as security for purchasing stocks or commodities with leverage. This enabled the small trader to speculate on otherwise “out of reach” stocks.  The action in these shops was fast and furious. One clerk read the ticker tape while another clerk wrote prices on a chalkboard. The speculators were able to quickly buy and sell the stocks as the “ticker” was read. Money was won or lost based on the inherent honesty of the shop operators. Needless to say, most were unlicensed and illegal. These shops died with the Stock Market Crash of 1929. After the crash, they were regulated out of existence.  Our modern markets were re-created as strictly regulated exchanges in the 1930’s. Today’s major markets include The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE - the Big Board), American Stock Exchange (Amex- now part of the NASDAQ), Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE), Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (NASDAQ). The major foreign exchanges (and their respective Indexes) are located in Germany (DAX), France (CAC), Hong Kong (Hang Seng), Japan (Nikkei), and London (FTSE). Equity markets trade stocks (securities) while other exchanges specialize in bonds, commodities, futures, and options. A small exchange fee is paid to the exchange for each share that changes hands utilizing its services.  A market is made when similar items are traded or exchanged. Our exchanges of today have their roots in the agricultural marketplaces. Farmers’ markets and coastal city fish markets still exist throughout the country. These marketplaces have given way to retail sales, but not long ago they still traded goods back and forth.  The 1929 Crash and the following Great Depression changed our way of doing business entirely. As noted above, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) instituted sweeping regulations to ensure that another crash would not happen. Congress established this U.S. regulatory commission in 1934, after the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency investigated the New York Stock Exchange's operations. The commission's purpose was to restore investor confidence by ending misleading sales practices and stock manipulations that led to the collapse of the stock market in 1929. It prohibited the buying of stock without adequate funds to pay for it, provided for the registration and supervision of securities markets and stockbrokers, established rules for solicitation of proxies, and prevented unfair use of non-public information in stock trading. It also stipulated that a company offering securities make full public disclosure of all relevant information. The commission also acts as adviser to the court in corporate bankruptcy cases.  In 1971, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) created a fully integrated, computerized trading system called the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system). This allowed NASD members to post competing bids and offers for a variety of stocks. Thus, the electronic “Over the Counter” (OTC) market was created. This was a major departure from the “auction” markets of old (NYSE, AMEX, etc), with their Specialists. OTC market trading does not take place on physical stock exchanges; such trading is most significant in the United States, where requirements for listing stocks on the exchanges are quite strict. It is often called the ""off-board market,"" and sometimes the ""unlisted market,"" though the latter term is misleading because some securities so traded are listed on an exchange. OTC trading was most often accomplished by telephone, telegraph, or leased private wire. Now the computers, with either Internet access or direct electronic connections are taking over this route of trading.  In this market, dealers frequently buy and sell for their own account and, usually, specialize in certain issues. Schedules of fees for buying and selling securities are not fixed, and dealers derive their profits from the markup of their selling price over the price they paid. The investor may buy directly from a dealer willing to sell stocks that he owns or with a broker who will search the market for the best price.  A third market has developed because of the increased importance of institutional investors, such as the mutual funds, who deal in large blocks of stock. Trading is done in shares listed on the exchanges but takes place over the counter (OTC); this permits large-quantity discounts not possible on the exchanges, where brokerage fees are fixed.  Much of the regulation of the OTC market is affected through the NASD, created in 1939, by an act of Congress to establish rules of conduct and protect members and investors from abuses. Although retail prices of OTC transactions are not publicly reported, the NASD began publishing inter-dealer prices for the issues on its national list in February 1965.  NASDAQ, created by the NASD in 1971, is an automated quotation system that reports on trading of domestic securities not listed on the regular stock markets. The NASDAQ is a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and is monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By opening the NASDAQ system to direct execution by the public, traders were able to increase competition, which has lowered the spread (the difference between the bid price and the ask) on many NASDAQ listed stocks. By the 1990’s, it had grown into the second largest securities market in the United States and the third largest in the world. In 1992, it was linked to the International Stock Exchange in London, forming the first intercontinental linkage of markets.  NASDAQ lists more than 5,000 securities. To be a member, a company must register with the SEC, and have at least two market makers; a market maker is a brokerage firm that acts as a principal on either side of an OTC transaction. They have the right to set the prices at which they are willing to sell and purchase the security. Those prices do not have to be at the current market prices. Market makers frequently make markets in multiple securities, and meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders. It publishes two composite price indexes daily and also bank, insurance, other finances, transportation, utilities, and industrial indexes.  As usual, there were “ups “and “downs” over the intervening years until the October 19 collapse of the market in 1987. This downturn was seen, at that time, as a terrible crash. History and hindsight shows a resilient market that bounced back and continued a Bull Run after a few months.  However, this “crash” caused a major panic in the investing public. Stockbrokers were overwhelmed by the sell orders. They could not execute them fast enough as the market plunged. As they fell further behind, the phone continued to ring. The result was that many brokers simply stopped answering them as they tried to catch up (or possibly hide out!). The obvious problem is the “falling safe” theory. Imagine a 1000-pound safe falling off a 10-story building. Who is going to “catch” it? In a fast dropping market, everybody would like to sell and close his or her positions – but who is going to buy the stock? The brokers have a difficult time unloading stocks in a major downtrend; it is nearly impossible to fill their customers’ wishes in a crash. Needless to say, as the clients scream into the phone, “Get me OUT!” the reluctance to deal with them builds. The phone rings, the broker swallows hard and says, “May I help you?”  That October in 1987, when the market was falling, there were enough brokers that didn’t answer their phones that the SEC implemented a new regulation that required market makers to buy a certain amount of stocks from small investors when the small investors want to sell. The SEC also formed rules that would eventually allow individual investors to buy and sell shares by connecting directly to the markets and make it mandatory for the market makers to handle the transactions. Over the next couple of years, these changes resulted in the updated Small Order Execution System (SOES).  SOES was the conduit for the individual investor to escape through. It is this system that allowed the world of “electronic” day traders to start. The next step was the creation of the first Electronic Communication Network (ECN) by the NASDAQ market. It was named Instinet (INCA) and was owned by Reuters. This ECN was originally designed for use by the institutional market and allowed market makers to trade anonymously. It did not take long for the re-emerging day traders to discover the uses of the automatic execution system of the SOES and the growing ECN network. In the 1990’s, we saw the creation of Island, Attain, RediBook, Bloomberg Trade Book and other ECNs. Eventually, the SEC and NASD realized that this platform of trading had to be open to all, not just market makers. The market makers dubbed these new direct electronic traders as “SOES Bandits” because of their quick hits and fast trades. It was a misnomer though, as the “Bandits” did not take from the system as much as they gave.  The NASDAQ, SOES and the ECN groups grew very quickly in the early 1990’s. The day traders provided liquidity in the OTC market that was never seen before. Their ability to set their own prices and live off of their trading further reduced the price of brokerage commissions and narrowed the, heretofore, very profitable spread.  Currently, there are several ECNs operating in conjunction with the NASDAQ. Day trading firms have sprung up across the country and even internationally. With direct electronic access, speed of light execution, and availability of ECNs, electronic day trading is here to stay. It is no less risky than the bucket shops of old, but it has become a legitimate, regulated and organized profession worthy of competing with the age-old trading houses"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|794430.0|public|confidence|self|How I became a millionaire|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ernvlg/how_i_became_a_millionaire/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||[]||||||||||||2020-01-21|WIRE

Step 1: everyone close out of your positions, your probably going to lose all your money anyways.   Step 2: Find some idiot that has zero knowledge of options. Have him open a Robinhood account with option trading. Tell him that if he buys a call and the stock goes up, you make money, buy a put and the stock goes down, you make money.   Step 3: Have everyone wire the idiot their money.   Step 4: Have him go all in on one position, buying as many contracts as possible.   Step 5: Watch as we get 400% roi   Step 6: Take that money and find a new idiot; go back to step 2.   Complete the cycle a couple times, establish world domination.

I laughed at the Cybertruck's engineering triangle-shaped body and armored glass botch like everyone else did. But I'm now stewing over the details of the thing ... a new cargo Sprinter with extended height would run me $40k, right? It would cost me at the very least $10k to insulate the interior, wire it for solar power and build cabinets and a bed frame with storage. So $50k. That's about as much as the Cybertruck would run.   Pro #1: body has no paint and is stainless steel, so I wouldn't have to be as paranoid about washing it, avoiding tiny branches or offroading with it vs. a Sprinter. Bigger wheelbase, more power and softer suspension (softer based on the test drive observations, anyway)  Pro #2: the bed is six foot six. My exact height. Meaning I can lay down back there fully. I can't do that in a fair number of full sized pickups. Cab interior and dash look great in the review vids, can use the non-driver seats for living space and more storage.  Pro #3: they said the grooves in the bed and on the sides of the bed are tie tracks like they use on cargo vans or cargo planes. Could easily use it to mount a retractable bed platform with an air mattress or arrangeable storage spaces. Would be easy to mount a soft or hard living space enclosure too, like here  https://media.techeblog.com/images/tesla-cybertruck-camper.jpg  Major, major con is getting access to charging stations in remote places Big Bend or Zion. I'm looking at the Supercharger map and it doesn't look good. There's non-Tesla chargers available, of course, but it'll take much longer to charge.

On a related note, the Bank of Japan left its policy rates unchanged but signaled a willingness to cut rates in the future.   The trade headline, however, appears to be increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries, which is driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield is down six basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.29. WTI crude is down 0.9%, or $0.49, to $54.56/bbl.   In economic data, investors will receive the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 216,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Employment Cost Index for the third quarter (Briefing.com consensus 0.7%), and the Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) report for September at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Underlying optimism that the U.S. and China are reportedly on track with trade deal progress has helped sentiment. On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28. Separately, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she expects growth in Hong Kong to be negative in 2019. Tokyo's core CPI came in softer than expected in October, with the effects of the sales tax hike garnering some attribution for the weakness.  * In economic data:    * South Korea's November Manufacturing BSI Index 74 (last 73)    * Tokyo October CPI +0.4% yr/yr (last +0.4%); Tokyo core CPI +0.5% yr/yr (expected +0.7%; last +0.5%)  \---Equity Markets---  * **Japan's Nikkei:** \+0.5% * **Hong Kong's Hang Seng:** \-0.4% * **China's Shanghai Composite:** \-0.9% * **India's Sensex:** \+1.5% * **South Korea's Kospi:** \-0.04% * **Australia's ASX All Ordinaries:** \+0.1%  \---FX---  * USD/JPY: unch at 108.92 * USD/CNH: -0.03% to 7.0624 * USD/INR: +0.2% to 70.898  **Europe**: DAX -0.2%, FTSE -0.9%, CAC -0.1%  Major European indices are experiencing modest losses, as buyers have been a reluctant bunch in today's trading action. Earnings news has failed to whet their appetite, with oil giant BP and packaging firm Stora Enso among the luminaries weighing on the bourses after reporting results that failed to please investors. The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn't in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31. The British pound had been weaker earlier, but has gained some ground following the report.  * In economic data:    * UK's October Nationwide HPI +0.2% m/m (last -0.2%); +0.4% yr/yr (expected +0.2%; last +0.2%); BoE September Consumer Credit GBP0.828B (expected GBP0.88B; last GBP 0.969B)    * France's October Consumer Confidence 104 (expected 104; last 104)    * Spain's September Retail Sales +0.1% m/m (expected +0.5%; last +0.2%); +3.4% yr/yr (expected +3.2%; last +3.3%)    * Italy's September PPI +0.1% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.4%); -1.7% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -1.4%)  \---Equity Markets---  * **STOXX Europe 600:** \-0.4% * **Germany's DAX:** \-0.2% * **U.K.'s FTSE 100:** \-0.9% * **France's CAC 40:** \-0.1% * **Italy's FTSE MIB:** \-0.1% * **Spain's IBEX 35:** \-0.5%  \---FX---  * EUR/USD: -0.2% to 1.1080 * GBP/USD: +0.03% to 1.2864 * USD/CHF: +0.1% to 0.9956  **DISCLAIMER: ALL CONTENT COURTESY OF** [**ATOM FINANCE**](https://atom.finance)**!**"|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|694895.0|public|confidence|self|Morning Briefing (10/29/2019)|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dopllz/morning_briefing_10292019/|no_ads|0.0||||||dark||||[]|1572441087.0|||||||||||2019-10-29|WIRE

The benchmark index could also open the busy week near its record highs that it almost hit on Friday.   Dow component **Walgreens Boots Alliance** (**WBA** 56.30, +0.88, +1.6%) is up nicely in pre-market action after it beat earnings expectations. Regarding Brexit, the EU has reportedly agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to Jan. 31 and would allow for an earlier exit if UK lawmakers approve the withdrawal plan in the interim.  Looking ahead, this week's biggest events will include **Alphabet's** (**GOOG** 1275, +9.87, +0.8%) earnings report after today's close, followed by **Apple's** (**AAPL** 247.40, +0.82, +0.3%) and **Facebook's** (**FB** 187.25, -0.64, -0.3%) after Wednesday's close; the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday; and the Employment Situation Report for October on Friday.  The docket will also include the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for October on Tuesday, the first estimate for Q3 GDP on Wednesday, and the Personal Income and Spending report for September on Thursday. Today will be limited to the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for September at 8:30 a.m. ET.   U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.75. WTI crude is down 0.4%, or $0.23, to $56.43/bbl.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **AT&amp;T** (T 37.23, +0.32): +0.9% despite missing revenue estimates, although it did issue upside guidance for FY20. The company will also receive about $1.1 billion in cash and be relieved of a $575 million debt guarantee after **Central European Media** (CETV 4.60, -0.50, -1.1%) agreed to be acquired by PPF Group for $4.58/share in cash, or approximately $2.1 billion.  * **Walgreens** (WBA 56.30, +0.88): +1.6% after beating earnings estimates and increasing its annual savings target.  * **Microsoft** (MSFT 144.45, +3.72): +2.6% after being awarded a $10 billion DOD cloud computing contract. * **Tiffany &amp; Co.** (TIF 126.47, +27.92): +28.4% after **LVMH** (LVMUY) confirmed that it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany.   Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region followed form with the U.S. market on Friday. Japan's Nikkei +0.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng +0.8%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.9%, India's Sensex closed for holiday South Korea's Kospi +0.3%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.02%.    * In economic data:       * China's September Industrial Profits -2.1% yr/yr (expected -1.2%; last -1.7%)    * In data:       * Investor sentiment was boosted by a Xinhua press report that suggested the U.S. and China have made progress on the text of a ""Phase One"" trade agreement. This news overshadowed China reporting a weaker than expected drop in industrial profits in September, and just about everything else in a session that lacked meaningful news drivers.       * The BOJ policy decision sits on the near horizon with an Oct. 30-31 meeting date. This decision will follow hot on the heels of the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting. * Major European indices aren't showing a lot of vigor to start the new week, although the positive mood surrounding U.S-China trade talks has been a supportive factor on the margin. STOXX Europe 600 -0.1%, Germany's DAX +0.4%, U.K.'s FTSE 100 -0.04%, France's CAC 40 +0.1%, Italy's FTSE MIB +0.1%, Spain's IBEX 35 unch.     * In economic data:       * Germany's September Import Price Index +0.6% m/m (expected +0.2%;

A Hearing Panel found that Shaalan violated the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct: I(C)- Misrepresentation; I(D) – Misconduct; III(A) – Duties to Clients (Loyalty, Prudence, and Care); III(C) – Suitability; and V(C) – Record Retention (2014). The Hearing Panel’s decision was subsequently reviewed and affirmed on appeal.   CFA Institute found that, starting in June 2016, an investor in the United Arab Emirates hired Shaalan to manage and invest money she had set aside for retirement. He met with the investor and told her about his investment strategies. Afterwards, Shaalan emailed her a document in which he downplayed the extreme risks associated with his strategies, putting the potential loss at 10% or less, while the potential profit was touted as 60% to 80% per annum.   Shaalan instructed the investor to open a brokerage account with Saxo Bank and to provide him with her username and password so that he could then gain access and trade in the account. In just 22 days, however, Shaalan had lost $195,000 of the $200,000 that the investor had deposited into the account.   Despite having lost almost all of the client’s money, Shaalan requested that she wire him additional money to invest. This time, he instructed her to send the funds directly to his personal bank account. As a result, the client wired Shaalan an additional $45,000 to invest. Shaalan told her that the $45,000 infusion would help him tune the mathematical and cognitive limits of his investment strategy and potentially recover the $195,000 lost.   Within several weeks of receiving the additional $45,000, Shaalan informed the client that he had invested and lost it all. The investor’s total loss of $240,000 represents approximately 80% of the money she had saved for retirement.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|645246.0|public|confidence|self|Guy loses CFA Charter because he lost 80% of his client’s money in less than a month!|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0j6fk/guy_loses_cfa_charter_because_he_lost_80_of_his/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||[]|1567874739.0|||||||||||2019-09-06|WIRE

Heat oven to 425°F. Line cookie sheet with foil; spray with cooking spray. 2. In shallow dish, place flour. In another shallow dish, beat egg and water. In third shallow dish, mix bread crumbs and cheese. Coat chicken with flour; dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread crumb mixture. Place on cookie sheet. 3. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink in center and coating is golden brown. Serve with dipping sauce.  ## Expert Tips  * A quick dredging in the flour, then egg before the final panko-Parmesan dip guarantees that the crispy coating will stick to the chicken once they’re baked. * Get air circulating for crunch—arrange the coated tenders on a wire cooling rack that has been sprayed with cooking spray on a rimmed baking pan. Bake in the hot oven until golden brown. * Have fun with dips. Mix a spoonful of basil pesto in a good mayonnaise, some plain Greek yogurt with a lot of chopped fresh dill and lemon zest, ranch dressing with crumbled bacon and lots of freshly ground pepper stirred in—or just straight up barbecue sauce. * For extra-crispy tenders, drizzle them with a couple of tablespoons of melted butter before baking.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|643463.0|public|confidence|self|Tendies, for all you poor fucks|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cz2hvl/tendies_for_all_you_poor_fucks/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||1567589200.0|||||||||||2019-09-03|WIRE

It's often looked upon as fear mongering, and sensationalism. Preparation is practical,  though.  &amp;#x200B;  This post is not intended to be fear mongering. In fact I want to discuss ways we can look at the market and plan for different scenarios that can mean we have no reason to be afraid.  Even if the S&amp;P500 was to trade at 1,000 (big drop from current price (Today is the 31st August 2019, price is 2,946), we can plan and act in such ways this is a non harmful event for us. Particularly those who have net worth's to protect that has heavy stocks exposure.  This is not going to be one of these, ""It's the top RIGHT NOW ... everyone panic!"" sort of posts. Regardless of my views on this, I know this is a message that would not be well received.  You do not know me, and too often people have cried wolf on this and been  laughably incorrect. Instead what I will do is describe price moves in the indices that most people will have every reason to believe at this point can't happen.  Hopefully, they do not happen. I am not gleefully fangirling for a market crash.  I just think there is prudence in preparation.  These events will not happen in the  hours after I post this,  so I'd ask you kindly suspend prejudices. There is nothing to be gained by bickering over opinions of whether this will happen or not. I just want to give my perspective on  how a person should protect themselves after it happens, if it does.  I'll cover some of the things I'd forecast will be points people will want to raise or questions likely to be asked.  If you'd like to skip to the forecast and subsequent trade plan you can scroll down to the line break (unless you're going to make a common comment, then please read the following section first).  &amp;#x200B;  # Why Do I think My Opinion Matters?  #   Many of you may be smarter than I in many ways, but few of you will have spent as much time assessing charting patterns as I have.  Indeed, many people will scoff at the very idea of ""lines on a chart"" being worth anything. I'm not here to have this debate, I fully agree your view point is rational and logical. If I'd not spent years watching price charts every day, I'd think the same.  I focus mostly on Forex markets. I know these well. There are many ways currencies look like they may move that are ways they should not move unless there is big problems in stocks. These are nagging warnings. The attitude to risk in the Forex markets is negative, and stock markets show dangerous patterns.  I watch these topping sorts of patterns every day. I see them in intra-day crashes, intra-week crashes and intra-month crashes.  Most major moves fit into these patterns, and when the same patterns are applied to previous stock markets in the months before they crashed, the way the patterns form and then complete (in a crash) is the same. From my perspective, these are just intra-decade crashes. There is little technical difference on the charts - although it's very different in the real  world it affects.  This is why I am doing this in a ""IF we see this ... then this is likely"".  I know at this point in the pattern, my methods predict something that will be highly unusual. If that thing happens, if we do not crash after that, we'd be breaking the trend of all market crashes in history (this is not likely, it does not seem the smart way to bet your net worth).  &amp;#x200B;  # Technical Analysis is Tea Leaves!  &amp;#x200B;  You're welcome to your opinion on this, and I do understand your point of view. I will not post examples to try and prove my perspective on it, since it will always be called ""curve-fitting"".  All I will say is nothing I have done in my years of trading has involved me persuading others what I do works. I do not sell training or anything of the like. I've spent many years using the things I've learned to bet my own money, and I've done well.  I will not debate on this subject, because it's always a deadlock. You can not convince me I've not seen what I've seen, and I can not show you what I've seen, and do not expect you to believe it without proof.  &amp;#x200B;  # Stop Fear Mongering!  &amp;#x200B;  I really would like to re-iterate, I do not want you to be afraid. I am going to describe something that might happen that will be scary if it does happen. If it does not, there is no problem.  I do not wish you to be fearful before, during or after.  &amp;#x200B;  This is like ""Stop, Drop and Roll"". None of us ever expect to be ablaze. If we are, this is good information. It will be better than running about waving arms and feeding the  flames to engulf us.  All I want to do here is to give you the ""stop, drop and roll"" of a market crash.  To prevent you panicking and making bad decisions at bad areas. To allow you instead to go, ""Fuck! Okay ... well that's not good. Now I have to ..."" if scary things do happen.  &amp;#x200B;  # No One Can Time the Market!  #   People have predicted and traded every stock market crash in history.  The fact that many people try this and get it wrong does not take away from the fact people get this right, then place the right trades and make millions.  Not many people make understanding the ways a market moves their life's work. If you do, you get a good feel for it's mood at any given  time.  &amp;#x200B;  # [Fundamental Analysis ] Says That Won't Happen!  #   I am not here to debate analysis viewpoints. Doing so has little use, it's better to forecast, assess and then take the best actions.  I'll confess I am too ignorant on many of these topic to engage in debate. I wake up every day 5 days a week and decide where to bet my money. In doing this, I've found charts forecast and news reports. I can find no way of making money by being told what happened already, so I use the charts.  What I will say is for the warning move I will discuss to happen, something news related will have to change. Some catalyst event will have to happen. In 2008, it was Lehman. Make no mistake, the warnings were on the chart long before the bankruptcy was in the news.  &amp;#x200B;  # Time in the Markets is Better than Timing the Markets  &amp;#x200B;  I am perfectly fine with this perspective, and not here to argue against it.  If the market could drop 50% or more and you'd not be concerned because you think it will be back up in 10 years, this is none of my business.  I'm a day trader, so for me personally timing the markets is everything. Spending a lot of time in the market day trading often means you've made a mistake. I'm looking for ways to get foresight into what market moves may develop and understanding of what times and conditions I can enter into these moves to profit from the.  I want to stress I am not necessarily advocating the average person tries to time the markets. In the same way an electrician would not suggest you re-wire your own home. You also could not say to the electrician it's better to leave the lights off than risk getting a  shock. Different preparations and skills sets give different possibilities.  I spent a lot of years and lost money through a lot of them starting out learning how to do this.  The things I will explain here will not allow a person to consistently time the market. If I may be excused a cheesy pun, this ""crash course"" will be dealing with only single event, and one single set of scenarios.  What I want to put forward for you in this is price moves to watch for and then (really quite specific) levels of price that are likely to offer us the best prices to protect long stock portfolios, or take speculative short trades. Very thin area of assessment.  #   &amp;#x200B;  ===================================================================================================  &amp;#x200B;  Forecast and Plan.  &amp;#x200B;  # What if the S&amp;P500 Went to 2,200 ... Quickly?  &amp;#x200B;  It's the weekend, and the last day of August in 2019. The S&amp;P500 has closed 2922 after rallying through the week after some sharp drops from all time highs. We may see record highs again if this keeps up ... but what if next week it opens and starts to fall? Or maybe rallies higher but can not make a new high and starts to fall.  What if it falls faster than it did in the last drop, and what if this time it does not stop? What if it gets to the lows of 2790, and goes from there quickly to 2700.  These big levels act as resistance and the market can not trade higher than them. Instead it hits them, reverses and goes down more.  &amp;#x200B;  I think people would be nervous, but there'd be still the feeling of this being a normal, albeit tough, corrective move. There's weekly lows of 2,333. Above here the market is still technically up-trending. What if we got there, and  the market went through it like it was nothing? What if the coming weeks or months we seen candles bigger than any we've seen recently? What if we were hearing news reports of record falls, rather than record highs?  What if over the development of only weeks and some horrific trading days we went from today's 2922 to break under the 2015 lows of 1,886?  I think people would be afraid!  Nothing I am saying is for the purposes of fear mongering, but I think this is possible. I'd like to say I think it's ""highly unlikely"", but I am thinking a lot about how to structure real  bets on it and I like my odds. **If this happens,** it's likely the market will go lower still. What you do during the following weeks and months may have a huge affect on your financial health by the start of 2021.  &amp;#x200B;  # How Does This Scenario Look on a S&amp;P500 Chart?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/ggqyvs2f6xj31.png  &amp;#x200B;  That looks like it's not going to happen, right? I think that this looks like it's not going to happen. We learn through our life experience,  and my life experience has taught me when I ignore what I think about things like this and build well structured trade plans that would assume it will happen, money comes. For me, this makes sense to bet on at the moment, as unlikely as it looks. That's getting a bit into ""Calling the high"", though. \\Which this is not about.  &amp;#x200B;  This is about what do you do if this happens?  What if there is a day when they say on the news that the market just made it's lowest point in the last five years ... and economists and experts say it can go down more!  &amp;#x200B;  **1 - Filter and assess your sources.**  Before you act or even think about the information these sources have (pertaining to what trades to make or expect), check what they were saying now. If they're not saying this could happen - don't worry too much about what they say happens next. They have as much chance of being wrong.  &amp;#x200B;  **2 - Do not panic.**  This is a time to remain calm.  Bad things have happened, and there will have been multiple days the market has dropped precipitously. Different economic factors explaining  these moves may be threatening to get worse and the market may take more dangerous swings spiking under recent lows.  This is the point at which most people will panic and make bad choices with their portfolio.  &amp;#x200B;  **3 - Buy Around 1,800**  This obviously sounds like something anyone would do right now, with price at 2,922; but with the conditions that'd have to be occurring for this of move to happen will make this highly counter intuitive at the time.  &amp;#x200B;  **4 - Understand Something Changed, New Highs are Not Coming**  From peak pessimism around 1,800 I expect the market to start to rally. Rallying strong. Making markets great again.  At this point, you should understand something has changed. The market is not meant to trade at that level in an up-trend. Frequently when these levels 'break', there is a strong counter move that is fierce. It's also brief.  We can buy here and offset some of the losses in the mini bounce (but be very cautious).  2,129 area is where the danger of a bear move comes back in. It might rally a bit above here into 2,333.  &amp;#x200B;  This is where the second mistake many people will make will be. Not buying the lows, but then starting to buy into this rally thinking it's going to new highs.  &amp;#x200B;  **Very Important: If price makes moves consistent with what I've described 2,220 - 2,300 are hedge areas.**  If you take appropriate actions in these areas you can protect yourself from the chance of excessive loss if the market is to crash in 2020. You can also do this without taking on much risk. Granted if you hedge long portfolios there is some risk of losing a little, but your area of risk on these hedges is less than the area of risk on a long portfolio after this has happened.  When this has happened, historically it's always led to a crash in the coming months/year.  We'll have done something the markets do not usually do. Big corrections may look similar, but when you deal with this all the time, you come to know there are specifics that should be noted.  If the levels I've mentioned for a buy fill, the market *is crashing. It's no longer a question of if.*  &amp;#x200B;  **5 - Hold Hedges Until 1,100**  &amp;#x200B;  If we crash, the low will probably be only a bit below this level.  Anything more than this in a fall would be truly horrific (I know many people think this is horrific, but from a  technical point of view this is really to be expected, and not unusual. It only happens after long periods of time, so it's unexpected and uncommon. It not unusual in trend formation).  &amp;#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/puc4slkk6xj31.png  I am not a financial adviser,  and can not tell you any trades you should be making to hedge portfolios or to take speculative positions. I've given these levels on the S&amp;P500, and there are many things correlated to this you could use to protect portfolios.  If this happens, I will be very much 'In the trenches'. I'll be trading in various markets every day and sharing some of my insights and trade plans, but I can't tell you specifically what to do.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I am only sharing this with you to let you know there are strategies people have used in the past to predict crashes, and I've used these strategies a lot and become good with them. They now predict a market crash starting in 2019, developing through 2020, and the things I've explained in this post would be the next steps if the prediction is accurate.  If the next steps happen, the strategy would then forecast the S&amp;P500 to go from 2,200 - 2,400 sort of range to 1,000.  I am asking no one to take this seriously at the moment, but I would suggest if the market makes moves similar to what I've described - you then consider there may be a lot of merit to what it further forecasts. Things could look very different from how they do this weekend in a few weekends time."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|642288.0|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TGwZ_mr3s-nwl3sH6FVnGpmtsqaKfDiO4kE4saDI8x8.jpg|2020 Foresight: What to do to Protect and Profit in Bear Market.|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cy69ro/2020_foresight_what_to_do_to_protect_and_profit/|no_ads|0.0|{'ggqyvs2f6xj31': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'ggqyvs2f6xj31', 'm': 'image/png', 's': {'u': 'https://i.redd.it/ggqyvs2f6xj31.png', 'x': 658, 'y': 331}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'puc4slkk6xj31': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'puc4slkk6xj31', 'm': 'image/png', 's': {'u': 'https://i.redd.it/puc4slkk6xj31.png', 'x': 662, 'y': 334}, 'status': 'valid'}}|70.0|140.0||||||||1567402774.0|||||||||||2019-09-01|WIRE

The S&amp;P 500 advanced in six of the last seven sessions. The Dow was up four in the last five sessions. (CNBC) * U.S.-China trade talks continue in Washington today, with President Donald Trump signaling flexibility on the March tariff cease-fire deadline. Chinese state media warned that new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would be ""catastrophic"" for global stocks.

CVS closed its $70 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna in November. (CNBC) * A winter storm is expected to batter every state east of the Mississippi River, bringing snow and ice. Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, and Washington should get the worst of the storm today. Airlines were already cancelling flights.

Earlier this month, the U.S. confirmed suspension of its participation in the decades-old Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. (CNBC) * The Trump administration wants California to pay back billions of dollars for the bullet train. California said the move was in response to the state suing the administration over the president's emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

(USA Today) * Goldman Sachs downgrades Southwest because new Hawaii route could be too costly (CNBC) * Payless ShoeSource, which filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, hopes to keep its 2,500 U.S. stores open until at least the end of March and the majority until May.

The attacks were carried out late last year through phishing campaigns to steal employee credentials and deliver malware.

Thanks in part to the popularity of A-List, the overall AMC Stubs program has surpassed 17 million member households, up from about 2.5 million member households only 2 1/2 years ago.  With the surging popularity of A-List which is also propelling more and more people to book their tickets online, AMC is taking further steps to make the movie-going experience more convenient than ever before.  Beginning immediately, households can use a common credit card as the payment method for separate, individual A-List accounts. Also effective immediately, AMC has extended the minimum age for AMC Stubs A-List from 18 years old currently to 16 years old with a valid photo ID. AMC plans to roll out reserved seating in all AMC-branded theatres and AMC DINE-IN theatres by June of 2019. This increase in reserved seating locations will not apply to AMC CLASSIC branded theatres. Also by the end of June 2019, all guests going to all the AMC-branded theatres in the metropolitan areas of Boston, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco will have access to AMC “Mobile Ordering,” which lets guests purchase their food and drinks online at the same time as they reserve their tickets, easily and conveniently picking them up when they arrive at the theatre. Mobile Ordering already exists and is functioning well at 52 locations in 24 markets around the country. In addition to these added benefits for AMC guests around the country, AMC is holding the line on A-List pricing for 2019, still unchanged at $19.95 plus tax per month in 35 states. AMC is making modest pricing adjustments in states where the program is most popular. Beginning January 9, 2019, the monthly price of AMC Stubs A-List will move to $21.95 plus tax for guests in Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington state and The District of Columbia. The program moves to $23.95 plus tax for guests in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.  Even so, all current A-List members as well as any new members who sign up before January 9, 2019, will continue to enjoy their 12-month $19.95 price guarantee from the start of their membership. So, to pick two illustrative examples, A-List members in Los Angeles who signed up in September of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their September 2019 billing cycle, or those in New York who will sign up as new A-List members in December of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their December 2019 billing cycle.  AMC will continue to operate its A-List program with transparency and clarity. So that A-List members can always know what they can expect with reliability and predictability, AMC hereby warrants that for all guests who join on or after January 9, 2019, the Company will provide at least 90-days advance notice before making any changes to their A-List program’s pricing or benefits. Additionally, reflecting commitments already made, for those A-List members who have joined or will join before January 9, 2019, they are assured not only of 90-days advance notice of any future change in pricing or benefits, but also that no such change would apply to them until 12 months after their initial enrollment date. As a reputable operator, AMC has no desire to whipsaw its guests with frequent change, nor would it do so without providing guests reasonable advance notice.  All other aspects of the AMC Stubs A-List program remain unchanged, including:  Up to three movies per week, in every available AMC showtime and format, including IMAX at AMC, Dolby Cinema at AMC, RealD 3D and Prime at AMC AMC Stubs A-List can be used at the spur of the moment or also can make planning ahead days or weeks in advance possible, as securing tickets is made easy via reservations capabilities on the AMCTheatres.com web site, or on the AMC Theatres mobile app. AMC Stubs A-List members also enjoy all the discounts and benefits of AMC Stubs Premiere, including free upgrades on popcorn and soda, free refills on large popcorn, express service at the box office and concession stand, no online ticketing fees and 100 points for every $1 spent for the AMC Stubs A-List monthly fee, tickets purchased for friends and family, and food &amp; beverage spending at AMC. AMC Stubs Premiere and A-List members receive a $5 reward for every 5,000 points earned, which translates to a 10% credit toward future AMC purchases. Adam Aron, AMC CEO and President, said, “In our minds, increasing enrollments to 17 million AMC Stubs member households over the past 2 1/2 years, or achieving initial enrollments of a half million members in AMC Stubs A-List in just 4 1/2 months, are astounding numbers. We have immensely successful programs here, and there should be no doubt, AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List are here to stay with these programs’ structures and valuable benefits remaining fully intact. Our objective for these programs is that they continue to be both popular and profitable. Our decision to keep the AMC Stubs A-List monthly price unchanged in 35 states, along with only a modest price adjustment in some key markets going in place in early 2019, will keep us in that sweet spot of successfully balancing profits and popularity. We encourage current A-List members to tell their friends and families that our 12-month price and benefit guarantee remains fully in place for A-List members who have already joined or who do so prior to January 9, 2019. So, the program pricing of $19.95 will remain at that level for everyone and will be unchanged anywhere for a full 12 months after initial enrollment if moviegoers act now to become A-Listers.”  For information about AMC Stubs A-List and to sign up, guests can inquire at their local AMC Theatre, or at AMC’s web site amctheatres.com/alist or on AMC’s iOS and Android mobile apps after downloading or updating them with the latest app release.  About AMC Stubs A-List  AMC Stubs A-List rewards guests with up to three movies per week, all for just $19.95 (plus tax) per month.

Or use a sketchy island broker w/ high commissions(suretrader)  However there is a great way to get past this at-least with interactive brokers. Here is how:  - you have your primary account that you open.  - you open a secondary “linked account”   - you now can do instant internal transfer and both accounts allow 3 day trades at a rolling 5 day period all on 4x margin if you’d like  - want 9 day trades? Linking new accounts is endless so open 3 if you’d like or 4,5,ect.  The only stipulation to this is how you initially deposited your money into the main account. Certain kinds of deposits require a 44 day clearing time by the ACH before you can transfer that money to another account. IB treats these linked accounts like other bank accounts because the clearing houses require them to.   So depending on how you initially deposit (initiated at broker, wire, initiated at bank, bill pay ect.) it can take 4 to 44 days to get cleared before you can shuffle that money on linked accounts via internal instant transfers. I think online bill pay is quickest with a credit hold of 4 days. 🚀|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|361035.0|public|confidence|self|How to legitimately get past PDT (no cash accounts, no sketchy offshore brokers, ect.)||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9sk7zk/how_to_legitimately_get_past_pdt_no_cash_accounts/|house_only|1.0||||||||||||||||||||||2018-10-30|WIRE

Sat down at the counter to enjoy, and noticed a young guy next to me with a breakfast bagel half way down his throat.  ""Getting practice for tonite?"" I asked.  ""Yep, working on the gag reflex...don't wanna throw up like last time""  We get to chatting about how it's horrible to live in an age where faggotry is becoming more accepted, and start talking about what we do for work. Apparently this kid was 27, still living in his mom's basement, and had been unemployed ever since the Burger King from down the street had gone out of business. He mentioned he was in the search for a job, but lately he had been losing most of his money **trading.**  ""What kind of trading do you do? Mostly buy &amp; hold or are you in and out a lot?""  ""Actually, mostly options trading. I lost $20k last month believe it or not"" he replied.  We get to talking about options, and that's when I realized this kid was full-blown retarded. And not the type of warm, fuzzy autism that makes you feel bad for knowing what 2 + 2 is. I am talking abiotically stupid. I tried explaining to him vertical spreads but for some reason he began talking about how naked calls on AMZN were gonna save his account and how SNAP calls were on sale. I felt like I was losing money just listening to him.  He mentioned he used Robinhood, and how he transferred all of his college savings there, *not* to spend it on stocks like Visa and diversify his portfolio, but to upgrade his account to Robinhood Gold and use *leverage* to maximize his MU gains. He even told me that it's not a loss until you sell it and how he's constantly calling Robinhood to reset his account after buying OTM weeklies. I about choked on my coffee like a faggot when I heard that.  The funniest thing was when he told me he got a tip to buy 420 TSLA calls earlier last month, but how his mom couldn't wire the funds into his account in time to have the funding secured. ""Ah, that MUSKed have hurt"" I said. Who knows, maybe next time he'll bring up his FDs or his newly professed love for Sue Bae. In the meantime, it's been over a day since our encounter and I just hope I can regain the IQ points I lost.

(NASDAQ:MU), one of the world’s largest        semiconductor companies, will invest $3 billion to        increase memory production at its operation in the City        of Manassas, creating 1,100 new jobs by 2030 in a community        that has become a regional hub for technology and advanced manufacturing        industries.       The City of Manassas        and the Commonwealth of Virginia        faced fierce competition against other U.S. states and countries like        the Republic of Singapore        to secure what the Virginia Economic Development Partnership        estimates to be the largest private-sector capital investment in modern Virginia        history. The expansion is also significant in that it marks the largest        project win in terms of increased exports for the Commonwealth and        strengthens Micron’s position as Virginia’s largest exporter. The City        of Manassas plans to work closely with major education        institutions like Northern Virginia Community College and George        Mason University to ensure Micron has a continuous pipeline of        qualified, technically-skilled labor.       On the heels of the recent news that Aurora Flight Sciences will invest $13.75        million in the City        of Manassas, Micron’s expansion further cements the City as        one of Virginia’s most highly sought after locations for technology        companies. Manassas        boasts:       &amp;#x200B;  * **Tenth highest weekly wages** and the **16th highest per capita          income** in Virginia;        * **Fourth highest wages in professional and technical jobs** in the          Commonwealth**;** and        * More than **20,000 people commuting into this City of 43,000** each          day to work at jobs in financial services, health care, homeland          security and defense contracting.         “Micron's expansion in the City        of Manassas represents one of the largest manufacturing        investments in the history of Virginia        and will position the Commonwealth as a leader in unmanned systems and        Internet of Things,” said Governor Northam. “This $3        billion investment will have a tremendous impact on our economy        by creating 1,100 high-demand jobs, and solidifies Micron as one of the        Commonwealth's largest exporters. We thank Micron for choosing to deepen        their roots in Virginia        and look forward to partnering in their next chapter of major growth.”       “For almost two decades Micron and Manassas        have been partners in the manufacturing of semiconductors and community        development, as the City was with IBM before them. The        significant benefits that the company brings Manassas        by virtue of their employment and investment help us make advances in        public education, infrastructure development and in maintaining a stable        tax rate for all of our citizens. On behalf of our entire community I am        thrilled Micron has chosen to modernize and expand operations here which        will guarantee the relationship continues into the future,” said Mayor Harry        J. Parrish II.   “Micron’s Manassas        site manufactures our long-lifecycle products that are built using our        mature process technologies, and primarily sold into the automotive,        networking and industrial markets,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay        Mehrotra. “These products support a diverse set of applications        such as industrial automation, drones, the IoT (Internet of Things)        and in-vehicle experience applications for automotive. This business        delivers strong profitability and stable, growing free cash flow. Micron        is grateful for the extensive engagement of state and local officials        since early this year to help bring our Manassas        expansion to fruition. We are excited to increase our commitment to the        community through the creation of new highly skilled jobs, expanded        facilities and education initiatives.”       **About the City of Manassas Department of Economic Development**   The City of Manassas        fosters economic development through collaborative partnerships,        sustainable fiscal management and supportive City services. The        Department of Economic Development (DED) is directly responsible        for business attraction, retention, expansion and tourism initiatives in        the City.

It wasn't until 2003 when the market started recovering. 2003 is the year Kanye released his first single Through The Wire. The market went on to gain 85% after the release of TTW with the support of the release of College Dropout(2004) and Late Registrstion(2005). 9/11/2007 Kanye released his critically acclaimed album, Graduation. Two months later his mom, Donda West, passed away. November of 2007 was the absolute peak of the stock market and the beginning of the dreaded 2008 recession. From August 2008 to October 2008 the S&amp;P 500 witnessed its biggest drop during the recession. A whopping 32% drop. November 2008 Kanye released his album, 808s and Heartbreak. Despite a slight bump in the market. The album was not critically acclaimed by the public initially. April 2009, less than 1 year from release of 808s, the market began its upward trend. Signaling the exact moment the public found out that they were sleeping on 808s. Kanye then went on to release a fucking classic, My beautiful dark twisted fantasy, in November 2010. Then WTT in 2011. Cruel Summer in 2012. Yeezus in 2013. And TLOP in 2016. Coinciding(wtf does this word even mean) with the bull run that has lasted since 2009. 2018 opened up with a rough patch as it's been 2 years since the release of Kanye's last album.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|307778.0|public|confidence|self|Does Kanye predict the stock market.

As the league’s Technical Advisor, KULR will work with drone designers, engineers, and pilots to deploy the company’s space-used and NASA-developed carbon fiber technology – helping DR1 push technical boundaries in speed, weight, and safety.  “We’re excited by this partnership,” said KULR’s CEO Michael Mo. “The DR1 league is already skirting the very limits of drone and electric vehicle performance and, with our space-flight carbon fiber, together we can do some things that will really blow people away.”  KULR’s core technology is a vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. The fiber solutions replace legacy cooling options such as fans, metal plates and liquid pump systems – things that don’t work too well on racing drones. KULR’s cooling systems can be used to cool drone cameras, fast quadrotors and batteries. The combined uses of the KULR fiber in dissipating heat from sensitive components and reducing the risks associated with battery failure will help make DR1’s racing drones faster and safer.  “Together we’re going to make DR1 drones into remote-piloted lightning,” Mo said. “But it’s not just about racing and winning – there will be a ton of testing, learning and innovating along the way,” he said.

American Express Plans to Increase Quarterly Dividend by 11 Percent and        Buy Back up to $3.4 Billion of Common Shares Through Q2        2019 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS        WIRE)--June 28, 2018--       American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) said today that the Board of        Governors of the Federal Reserve System did not object to its adjusted        capital plan submitted as part of the 2018 Comprehensive Capital        Analysis and Review (CCAR). The plan included:         \-- Increasing the Company's quarterly dividend to 39 cents per share       beginning with the third quarter 2018 dividend declaration, subject to       approval by the Company's board of directors;     -- Repurchasing up to $3.4 billion of common shares during the CCAR approval       period of Q3'18 to Q2'19. This new authorization enables the Company to       repurchase up to $1.6 billion of common shares in calendar year 2018, and       up to an additional $1.9 billion in the first half of 2019.   The plan supports the Company's objectives to restore capital to target        levels while supporting asset growth and distributing capital to        shareholders. As previously announced, the Company plans to resume share        repurchases in the second half of the year.       The timing and amount of common shares purchased under the Company's        authorized capital plans will depend on various factors, including the        Company's business plans, financial performance and market conditions.        Repurchase of common shares will be pursuant to the share repurchase        program previously authorized by the Company's board of directors on September        26, 2017.       As required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer        Protection Act, the Company has also published on June 21, 2018        a summary of the results of the Company-run stress tests performed under        the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. These disclosures do        not reflect the capital plan described above, but reflect certain        assumptions and capital actions as required under the Federal Reserve's        rules.

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Goldberg Law PC, a national shareholder rights litigation firm, announces that it is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Shopify Inc. (“Shopify” or the “Company”) (SHOP).  If you purchased or otherwise acquired Shopify shares, and would like more information about the investigation, we encourage you to contact Michael Goldberg or Brian Schall, of Goldberg Law PC, 1999 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1100, Los Angeles, CA 90067, at 800-977-7401, to discuss your rights without cost to you.  You can also reach us through the firm’s website at http://www.Goldberglawpc.com, or by email at info@goldberglawpc.com.  The investigation focuses on whether Shopify and certain of its officers and/or directors violated federal securities laws. On October 4, 2017, Citron Research published a report characterizing the Company as “a completely illegal get-rich quick scheme.” The report alleged that Shopify inaccurately described its relationship with certain affiliates, stating, in part: “Shopify calls these affiliates ‘partners.’ We call them promoters selling business opportunities.” The report compared the Company’s business practices to those of Herbalife Ltd., a company that recently paid $200 million and agreed to an order “prohibit[ing] Herbalife from misrepresenting distributors’ potential or likely earnings” to settle Federal Trade Commission charges. Following this news, Shopify’s stock price dropped.  If you have any questions concerning your legal rights, please immediately contact Goldberg Law PC at 800-977-7401, or visit our website at http://www.Goldberglawpc.com, or email us at info@goldberglawpc.com.

(NYSE American:XXII), a plant biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, announced today that officials from the Global Tobacco &amp; Nicotine Forum (GTNF) have invited the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Henry Sicignano, III, to participate on a GTNF panel entitled “Future Next Generation Products” on September 14, 2017 in New York City.  The Global Tobacco &amp; Nicotine Forum is the world’s foremost exchange of ideas and information for tobacco technologies and products. Attendees to the forum include public health advocates, policymakers, scientists, and international tobacco industry executives. Visit www.gtnf-2017.com for more on GTNF. Also speaking at this year’s forum are:  Mitch Zeller, Director, US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products. Together with FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, in August 2017, Mr. Zeller, released an article entitled, “A Nicotine-Focused Framework of Public Health.” Published in The New England Journal of Medicine(NEJM), the article spells out the FDA’s regulatory authority for mandating non-addictive levels of nicotine in combustible cigarettes.  Dr. Dorothy Hatsukami, Forster Family Chair in Cancer Prevention; Associate Director, Masonic Cancer Center; and Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota. In 2016, together with two other prominent scientists, Dr. Dorothy Hatsukami wrote in Tobacco Control that failure to act on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of mandating nicotine reductions in cigarettes to non-addictive levels could lead to the loss of millions of lives.  Dr. Michael Cummings, Professor, Medical University of South CarolinaDepartment of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences; and Co-Director, Tobacco Policy and Control Program at Hollings Cancer Center. As an expert in tobacco policy, Dr. Cummings is often called upon to guide global tobacco control policy initiatives around the world. Earlier in 2017, Dr. Cummings gave the keynote address at 22nd Century’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  “Since the FDA announced its intention to mandate that all cigarettes have very low, non-addictive levels of nicotine, the public health community has focused much of its attention on 22nd Century,” explained Henry Sicignano, III, President and Chief Executive Officer of 22nd Century Group. “We look forward to working together with scientists and policymakers to make Very Low Nicotine cigarettes a public health reality in the United States and around the world.”  About 22nd Century Group, Inc.  22nd Century is a plant biotechnology company focused on genetic engineering and plant breeding which allows the increase or decrease of the level of nicotine in tobacco plants and the level of cannabinoids in cannabis plants. The Company’s primary mission in tobacco is to reduce the harm caused by smoking.

Here are the three orders. Technically two of them are presidential memoranda.  * [Presidential Executive Order on Identifying and Reducing Tax Regulatory Burdens](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/presidential-executive-order-identifying-and-reducing-tax-regulatory)   Tl;dr: Secretary of the Treasury shall bring me a plan to make taxes cheaper, to make filing taxes easier, and to point out any taxes that exceed the IRS's statutory authority.   * [Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/presidential-memorandum-secretary-treasury-0)  Tl;dr: Secretary of the Treasury shall examine the Orderly Liquidation Authority and determine if it causes undue moral hazard, whether it's really necessary to prevent failing companies from failing in the first place, whether it causes financial burden to the taxpayer (whether the Orderly Liquidation Fund works as intended), and whether liquidation of failing companies instead could be handled by a new chapter of the bankruptcy code or by a modified chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.  Background on the OLA: The OLA steps in to quickly and (hopefully) less painfully liquidate companies than would happen in normal bankruptcy proceedings. The costs of this are to be borne by the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which is supposed to be replenished by assessments on other financial companies. Basically instead of letting a dying elephant thrash around and cause panic, the government comes up and shoots it.  Basically the two sides to this executive order are: (a) if you're an elephant and you get sick, is the government gonna come shoot you cause they think you were gonna die anyways? And does this mean we don't need to worry about dying elephants around us? Plus who pays for the bullets and cleanup? (b) These panic caused by an elephant in its death throes may cause an injury-causing panic/stampede, even if no other animals are gored by the flailing tusks. [More in-depth pro-OLA by Ben Bernanke himself, though for some reason he doesn't use elephant metaphors](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/02/28/why-dodd-franks-orderly-liquidation-authority-should-be-preserved/).   * [Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/presidential-memorandum-secretary-treasury)  Tl;dr: Secretary of the Treasury shall examine the Financial Stability Oversight Council to determine its transparency, whether it uses due process, whether it gives implicit bailout guarantees, whether its methods of evaluation considers the likelihood of distress (rather than just potential magnitude), whether specific quantitative magnitudes of potential damage of failing institutions to the US economy are generated, whether the costs to the regulated entity are examined, whether entities have a fair chance to defend themselves, whether entities are told how they can reduce their risk below the threshold, and whether the FSOC is consistent with Trump's earlier executive order, titled ""Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System.""  Background on the FSOC: Some large institutions are not regulated by any bank regulators (OTS, OCC, Fed, FDIC, NCUA) and do not fall under the requirements of Basel III, yet act similarly to banks and have similar consequences of failure. For example: Fannie and Freddie, Countrywide's non-bank section, AIG FP, bank holding companies, money market funds, and other shadow banks. In an attempt to close this loophole, the FSOC was created and given the duty (among a few other duties) of identifying these companies or industries, and determining whether they are to be brought under the supervision of the Fed. This isn't just for regulatory purposes, but also allows the entities to use Fed's wire transfer system (fedwire), and allows the Fed to more easily pump liquidity into these entities through the use of the discount window, without having to (I believe) use [Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm).  Basically the two sides to this executive order are: (a) this is a way for the government to regulate anybody they want as a bank without the burden of proof, and (b) if you're gonna be too big to fail and may require a bailout, you need to be regulated as such."||False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|4/21 Executive Orders TL;DR and Discussion||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/66xybm/421_executive_orders_tldr_and_discussion/||||||1492890785.0||||0.0|||||||False|||||{}|{}|2017-04-22|WIRE
