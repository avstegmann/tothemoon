Micron MU, 2.69% is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings results after the close of markets Wednesday. The Boise, Idaho-based chip maker considerably raised its forecast for the second quarter earlier this month, setting up expectations for the rest of the year.  The big gain in sales is largely the result of the global semiconductor shortage that developed amid heightened demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Micron could see revenue surge by more than $1 billion from its core memory products, and analysts expect those types of gains to continue throughout 2021.  Read: Worldwide chip shortage expected to last into next year, and that’s good news for semiconductor stocks  Micron specializes in DRAM and NAND memory chips. DRAM, or dynamic random access memory, is the type of memory commonly used in PCs and servers, while NAND chips are the flash memory chips used in smaller devices like smartphones and USB drives.  Analysts on average expect DRAM sales of $4.3 billion, up from $3.08 billion in the year-ago period, and NAND sales of $1.6 billion, up from last year’s $1.51 billion, according to FactSet.  Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, who has a buy rating on Micron and a $100 price target, said he sees the the second half of 2021 as an exceptional cycle for memory-chip makers as “growth shows more potential upside after recovering from pricing and data-center demand headwinds in 2H20/1H21.”  Rakesh said that DRAM pricing for PCs are expected to rise 19% from a year ago, when prices dropped 17% year-over-year. NAND prices are expected to remain stable and possibly recover a bit, with 5G-device launches as a tailwind.  Ahead of the report, the company said it was dropping development of 3D XPoint technology in order to focus on compute-express link chips for data centers. What to expect  Earnings: Micron on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of 95 cents a share, up sharply from 66 cents a share expected at the beginning of the quarter, based on 29 analysts surveyed by FactSet. Micron forecast earnings of 93 cents to 98 cents a share at the beginning of March, up from its previous forecast of 68 cents to 72 cents a share. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of 98 cents a share.  Revenue: Wall Street expects revenue of $6.19 billion from Micron, according to 28 analysts polled by FactSet. That’s up from the $5.54 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter. Micron predicted revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.25 billion at the beginning of March, up from its previous forecast of $5.6 billion to $6 billion. Estimize expects revenue of $6.26 billion.  Stock movement: Over Micron’s fiscal second quarter, the stock rose nearly 21%, compared with a 4.3% increase on the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, 3.22% over the same period, a 1.9% rise by the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 0.72% and a 2.8% gain by the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 1.99%. Micron shares closed at $94.60 on March 1, their highest closing price in more than 20 years. What analysts are saying  Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse, who has an outperform rating and a $135 price target, said in a note related to Micron’s hiked forecast that broader chip shortages will keep demand high.  “Longer-term, with management calling out undersupply for DRAM through all of CY21 (and even hinting this could continue into CY22) and falling NAND inventories leading to a higher likelihood of a turnaround there, we see a strong roadmap for estimates to continue moving higher through-out CY21,” Muse said.  UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, who has a buy rating, said a recent discussion with a former Micron executive indicated that the company’s lesser exposure to NAND compared with competitors gave it an advantage while it stands to benefit from continued high DRAM demand.  “DRAM consolidation has played out and Samsung, Hynix &amp; MU are behaving rationally, even as demand remains robust to the point where it is plausible that hyperscalers may consider pre-paying for supply,” Arcuri said.  Of the 34 analysts who cover Micron, 28 have buy or overweight ratings, and six have hold ratings, with an average price target of $114.86.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9701015.0|public|confidence|self|Micron earnings: Semiconductor shortage leads to heightened expectations|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhdp54/micron_earnings_semiconductor_shortage_leads_to/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-03-31|EXPR

It's fucking *painful* seeing some of your accounts get annihilated while people spread half-truths and lies and empty promises. So even though I'm going to share a dirty secret with you all, and probably ruin my most recent and most profitable trading strategy, **fuck it**. I just don't like seeing people get grifted -- even if these same people are downvoting me, calling me a shill, telling me to fuck off and educate myself and read whatever passes as ""DD"" nowadays, whatever. You need to know the truth.  And before someone comments on the suspicious nature of my profile, my original account has been shadow-boned from posting threads in WSB and mods never respond to my requests for threads to be approved. Mods can verify my other profile -- almost a decade old, with thousands of posts in WSB.  So, here's how hedgies are grifting you all out of a **LOT** of money:  * 1. Make a horrible short play, losing billions of dollars in money  * 2. Borrow funds to stay solvent  Needless to say, steps 1 and 2 aren't intentional and they've been covered in a lot of detail already, so I'll summarize: hedge funds shorting GME were squeezed when GME rose drastically in price. What caused the slow squeeze? Probably *not* WSB buying GME, since most people hopped in near the very peak and were eaten alive. WSB certainly contributed to the final and most dramatic part of the squeeze, but we all know what happened next: brokers pulled the plugs, and apes were left holding the bags. There *was* a genuine strategy here when retail were buying GME, and the only way the hedge funds could win was by playing dirty.  * 3. Realize the beast you unleashed is actually a (ba)boon Hedge funds realized a beast had been created as nu-WSBers leaned into the ""dumb ape smoothbrain baboon"" jokes a *little* too far. These people -- largely millenials and zoomers who *hated* hedge funds for their role in the financial crisis, or for the state of the world today -- would do *anything* to stick it to the hedge funds -- even if it meant dousing their own savings in gasoline and lighting them on fire. The best part was that the majority of these traders were complete noobs to investing -- they [don't know that stocks often trade together](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbswiu/gme_and_amc_are_following_the_same_pattern/), they [believe wild conspiracy theories about short laddering, fake short float %s](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la9ymc/questions_on_short_float_short_ladder_attacks_and/), [they think there's an actual, genuine chance a stock can *actually* reach $130,000 a share and eclipse the GDP of Germany](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls0wmd/if_gamestop_hits_800_before_226_we_will_trigger/), and they don't understand the difference between share price and market cap [place holder for proof coming shortly -- look for the bait].  * 4. Set up a gamma squeeze Ahh, the hedge fund favorite -- the dreaded gamma squeeze! Both friend and foe of many favorites, such as TLRY, RIOT, LFIN, HYLN, SPCE, LTEA, and more! You'll notice some of these tickers don't even exist anymore. That doesn't matter -- they sure were a lot of fun when they were going up 120% over a day or two!  So what's a gamma squeeze? It's when people (by which I mean “corporations”) chain together call options, and exercise these call options sequentially, forcing market makers to hedge their positions by buying shares, which in turn raises the price of the stock and causes the OTM call options to be ATM/ITM, at which point *these* options will be exercised, causing an incredible feedback loop that causes the stock to rise just because it's *already* rising. Powerful stuff. For only a few million dollars, you can move billions of dollars' worth of stock. Impressive! But not something a rag-tag group of disheveled and disorganized investors could pull off -- as much as you'd like to believe it.  So what does this mean? This means that the hedge funds -- you know, the guys who were *shorting* the stock before -- suddenly own hundreds of thousands, and maybe even millions, of shares.  Heh, and these were the guys that WSB thinks are now “short.”  * 5. Convince people the ongoing gamma squeeze is actually a short squeeze  It's not hard to convince people what they *want* to hear! It doesn't matter that the short borrow rate was incredibly low -- that doesn't help our case! Giddy-up, confirmation bias! Distraction! Look at the short borrow availability. It's going up! That means shorts are exiting, that's good, that means the price will raise! Huzzah! Oh, now it's going down! That's even better! It just means there's more shorts to squeeze. Up is good, down is good. Green is good, red is good. Don’t ask questions, just hold.  * 6. Encourage people not to ever sell, except unrealistic lofty prices of 1k a share, 10k a share, 100k a share  [Look at this fuckin' goofball again](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls0wmd/if_gamestop_hits_800_before_226_we_will_trigger/). Point out a single other stock in the world that could have this valuation. I won't hold my breath. (This is the bait)  If you keep buying, and you never, *ever* sell, then the hedge funds can sell at *great* prices! If you don't have stop-losses set, then that is CASH MONEY for the hedges. That means selling pressure won't be *too* intense when these hedge funds offload their shares onto smoothbrain retail looking to ""buy the dip before this goes to $100,000 a share""  Don't worry, they won't think to ask questions about why short interest is going down at the same time that the stock is plummetting. (Important reflection question: ""Who's selling, then?"")  * 7. Spread disinformation  Dumb ape smoothbrain nu-WSB retail investors don't know the difference between fact and fiction. Lean into that. Make up terms if they make GME sound like a good buy. Play up bullshit that others came up with. Some of this stuff is too hard to understand (by design!). Who will ever bother verifying all of these specious claims? **If it sounds good, it is good**. And if someone asks for a source? **Fuck sources**. We got upvotes! We got HYPE! We got smoothbrains! Short fees are low so they're just *made up*! Synthetic shorts obscure the *real* short rate! Ladder attacks are *real*, and they show that hedge funds are *desperate*!

The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV. The company was formerly known as NextEV Inc. and changed its name to NIO Limited in July 2017. NIO Limited was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Shanghai, China.     * ELI12       * Sells and manufactures a variety of luxury cars       * Offers a multitude of charging solutions       * Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car)       * Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance  **Catalysts**  *  European Market Expansion    * [https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/02/27/chinese-nio-electric-cars-europe/](https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/02/27/chinese-nio-electric-cars-europe/)       * Nio plants to enter European markets in the second half of 2021 and other onlother internetational markets in 2022. – CEO William Li at an online conference, February 2021.        * “Analysts suggest that Norway may be the first European market for NIO.       *  ”Nomura analysts predict that it will jump to over $80 within the next few months, if it continues to meet delivery targets.    * Rapid Clean Tech Movement    * New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors    * NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year    * Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages   **Analyst Consensus**  **This shows how NIO is undervalued at this time. Here is a compilation of price targets.**  * Morgan Stanley: $80 * J.P. Morgan: $75 * Deutsche: $70 * Bank of America: $70 * Goldman Sachs: $64 * Daiwa: $100   **Why buy NIO…**  * Good growth opportunity * Good market (Local environment too) *  Good strategic approach * The banks have price targets way above where it is now (i.e. $45.50 as of 3/12/21) * Great strategic approach.  * Great management * Many are calling William Li a genius and the “Elon Musk of China.” * One thing that NIO has done exceptionally well where Tesla failed is their battery-swapping tech. So as a buyer of a NIO fleet vehicle you have the option to purchase with or without a battery. If you choose not to purchase a battery you can sign up for a battery subscription service by paying a monthly fee and use one of NIO’s battery swap-stations to exchange your run down battery for a fully charged one. Think of it like a gas station but with batteries instead.     * This is smart of NIO to pursue this type of program especially in China where most individuals aren’t living in large houses with the ability to install a charging station directly into their garage wall. For that reason alone NIO seems like a better choice for an EV vehicle if you are living in densely populated areas with little to no space. * China’s market share on a global scale is massive and one thing China does often is promote and back their own companies over US. China is very competitive and loves to win and get out on top. In my opinion China wants to produce EV companies that not only compare with Tesla but overall outperform and take a bigger piece of the EV-pie. * NIO is being touted as China’s Tesla. * NIO also understands that while people are paying for the subscription service - sometimes they just don’t drive. NIO’s subscription service keeps customers paying month to month even after that initial sale.  * China won’t let their EV companies fail. * China has stated that they want 25% of all new vehicles sold in the country to be electric by 2025. Currently EV sales are only contributing to about 5%. So in the next four years we’re going to see an EV boom all across China. That means the government would likely be installing more charging stations across the country and possibly kickbacks for citizens who purchase EV. * It’s no secret that the emissions in China are insane. It sure would be nice for China to be able to come out in a few years and say, “Hey look at how much we improved.” I believe this is exactly what’s going to happen especially when you really look at the policies the Chinese government has put in place for electric vehicles vs. combustion engine vehicles.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀Recommendations🚀🚀🚀🚀**  *  **buy NIO calls; lots of volume in the following**    * **Mar 19 50c (currently $0.68)**    * **Mar 26 50c (currently $1.41)**    * **Apr 1 50c (currently $2.14)**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9543876.0|public|confidence|self|🚀🚀NIO calls will print this week🚀🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5etn4/nio_calls_will_print_this_week/|some_ads|7.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Rpm4-3hZ4Jw8x6FsLhz21mpbVex_gyFVgSPl-Z5Oqrc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 79, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xpzHHkqiHlRZtHRHfwaxX-1aLGxujl4C2OqczxesCz4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27a55a0269b8512bfe22f38b7583b4632bb6448a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 159, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xpzHHkqiHlRZtHRHfwaxX-1aLGxujl4C2OqczxesCz4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c674cb9e0a635cb41d58df7dd111b968d0fdca48', 'width': 216}, {'height': 236, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xpzHHkqiHlRZtHRHfwaxX-1aLGxujl4C2OqczxesCz4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67649d0de7b18f93b19470183fc952ed48fd6605', 'width': 320}, {'height': 472, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xpzHHkqiHlRZtHRHfwaxX-1aLGxujl4C2OqczxesCz4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de07afb9334e66904d67aff7d450a134607610de', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 544, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xpzHHkqiHlRZtHRHfwaxX-1aLGxujl4C2OqczxesCz4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=58081001b05190f9ce2034c20fc6a87da201b645', 'width': 737}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2021-03-15|EXPR

It is ever changeing, but we all know the exact time will end up being 4:20:69,00 USDollars.  DD = Diamond Dicking This term applies to content posted on this sub that aims to erect the primate male's genital to extreme degrees. Typically this is done by means of numbers, colours, charts, rockets, diamonds and such, and is a confirmatory agent of masculinity. Example:  ""Have you read the GME DD this morning? Damn, that was more effective than my wife's boyfriend's mother's sister's brother. Totally tingled my jingles.""   Short = half-cover legwear. This piece of clothing often reflects a lack of interest in or respect for the current situation, event or stock.  Example:  ""Melvin's wife's boyfriend came in shorts to my boyfriend's wedding yesterday. Do you think he was mocking them?"" - ""Don't think so. Maybe he was expecting some high school swimming pool party. But, boy! -- was he surprised. And very much ashamed, I can imagine.""  Naked short: an elusive and potentially revealing short This is a special kind of short. The wearer bluffs people into believing he is wearing a skin-coloured short with a penis drawn on it, in order to express his disregard to the fullest. However, in reality the short in question is actually not a short at all, rather a whiteboard-marker drawing, effectively leaving the wearer naked to those that notice. Example:  ""Wow man, Melvin was no doubt aggrevating my wife's boyfriend's this time! Those shorts were unacceptable truly."" - ""Uhm, you don't really believe those were actual shorts, do you? "" ""Of course i do! I mean, there's just no way his real penis would be that tiny, lol. Right? Right???""  HODL = 'Hold On = Don't Lose' Remember, it's only a loss if you sell.  FUD = Financially Unreliable Distractor Ignore negative energy at all times. Example:  ""GME shorts have been covered, to as low as 20% according to Newspaper X."" - ""These fucking FUD posts again.. *sigh*  NFA = Not For All This financial advice is complex and of high quality. This is therefore not meant for everyone, only for the brave (=intellectual superior).  ** Some other important hints and indicators to look out for ** Moon = a guarantee for profit and a promise of wealth. Rocket = an invitation for a free ride to moon (or Mars). Whenever you see this, do not ask questions, do not think twice -- hop on, buckle up, and enjoy.

To everyone donating and sponsoring animals you have no idea how much you’re helping. Typically, countries that contain high levels of endangered apes are lower on the GDP scale and have very little funding so the influx of even a tiny bit of cold hard cash to these foundations is going to have a positive cascading effect on the local ecosystem. I’m not sure how many fellow conservationists there on WSB/GME but I’d like to thank you personally for the positive impacts you have/will make.   I thought I would throw my two cents in and suggest some highly effective NGO’s that do miracles. My passion is African wildlife so all the NGOs listed will have major projects within African countries and yes most have projects that protect apes. I am in no way connected to any of these organisations I just know the work they do is important.   *\*\*This is not financial advice; I am not a financial advisor just a gibbon with a keyboard. Please do your own research when donating to any charities\*\**  1.**Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International** 🦍  [https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/GeneralDonatecopy1/index.html](https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/GeneralDonatecopy1/index.html)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rcili5kc10n61.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84a54efeb17b1726c7f5814af84ed515bfe996d2  These guys a popular choice to choose when sponsoring endangered apes directly on here. Funding goes directly to anti-poaching/research/education and local communities (highly important). Their C.E.O has already thanked WSB personally: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a\_message\_to\_wsb\_from\_the\_director\_of\_the\_dian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/)  If they can be a Gorila stronghold for 50 years you can hold till we get to the moon   **2. Virunga National Park** 🦍  [https://virunga.org/support-us/donate/](https://virunga.org/support-us/donate/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8a93dmcd10n61.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05fa97aa90f8dc534ca1e0402a18d4bb082c9e4e  This is personal: Earlier this year 6 gorilla rangers were shot and killed here on January 12th in an ambush. There are poor countries in Africa, then there’s the Congo – it receives very little help and small donations would be a huge fucking help. You can choose to adopt a fellow ape and the money would go towards helping the entire park protect our brothers and sisters.  **3. African Parks**  [https://www.africanparks.org/donate](https://www.africanparks.org/donate)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zqypxo3e10n61.png?width=216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21a7615595a7c9c7180f6b7d37ed042880b3f6f1  These guys are kings in what they do and probably the most important on this list. They're taking long term control of natural areas across the continent and provide protection and management to over 40,000 square miles (roughly the size of Germany). Their work involves all aspects of park management, from research projects to anti-poaching. Africa parks will be responsible for preserving green spaces in Africa for years to come.  **4. Frankfort zoological society** 🦍  [https://fzs.org/en/donate-now/?form=](https://fzs.org/en/donate-now/?form=)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/nn1jo4re10n61.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed117823ab09eb32f074d209887e39c1cb2b718  In honour of HeyItsPixeL FZS is a German-based NGO with a focus on conserving biodiversity and protecting wilderness areas through multiple projects around the globe – a really efficient organisation and industry renown for effective strategies.  **5. Endangered wildlife trust**   [https://www.ewt.org.za/campaigns/ewt-donations/](https://www.ewt.org.za/campaigns/ewt-donations/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1y58x9jf10n61.jpg?width=165&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20328fe802142ce5410fbe18b1ecfb35ef561109  If you guys are lucky enough to go and see wild predators in Africa in 20 years it’ll be largely due to the work these guys do. This South Africa NGO uses applied research to maintain predator and bird of prey species populations within and around protected areas. Projects are primarily in South Africa but are expanding to other African countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. Personally working for these guys would be my dream job.  **6. Elephants Without Borders**  [https://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/](https://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/pswatv4g10n61.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a901583dd81c6818bf31b721ee79b429175328f6  I’ve seen a couple of elephants been sponsored in the name of GameStop and would love to nominate this NGO as a candidate for anyone willing. Primarily these guys operate within Botswana (the country with the highest population of elephants in the world and also known for its 💎's). The African elephant population is bearish, to say the least – these guys are doing great things to try and bring it back up.  **7. Naankuse Foundation Wildlife Sanctuary**  [https://naankuse.com/donate/](https://naankuse.com/donate/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/no64h2rg10n61.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a30bf4679dc1e95e8677e5138340015e778714a  This is the only wildlife sanctuary that I know of that I would put on the list. Naankuse started by saves predators (mainly cheetahs) that have been captured by farmers that would otherwise shoot them for eating their livestock. Now they’ve grown into a huge ecotourism organisation that I would recommend volunteering with if you want to get up close with African wildlife.  **8. Jane Goodall Institute** 🦍  [https://janegoodall.nationbuilder.com/donate](https://janegoodall.nationbuilder.com/donate)  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img r5oy2lfh10n61...*  Someone change that leaf to a diamond  Finishing the list with the queen of Primatology herself Jane Goodall. The institute provides sanctuaries in multiple countries for apes that have been affected by poaching or wildlife conflict for rehabilitation and hopefully release. Jane Goodall herself has made a huge impact on ape populations across Africa and probably responsible for countless wild populations of chimpanzees  **Final appreciation**  I wanted to thank you all of you apes – I’ve chosen a field of work that I love but will never make me rich but when GME takes off, I’ll continue perusing my dream of helping African wildlife but after visiting different galaxies onboard the monkey expresses I’ll be able to contribute way more than I ever could thanks to you guys.

To everyone donating and sponsoring animals you have no idea how much you’re helping. Typically, countries that contain high levels of endangered apes are lower on the GDP scale and have very little funding so the influx of even a tiny bit of cold hard cash to these foundations is going to have a positive cascading effect on the local ecosystem. I’m not sure how many fellow conservationists there on WSB/GME but I’d like to thank you personally for the positive impacts you have/will make.   I thought I would throw my two cents in and suggest some highly effective NGO’s that do miracles. My passion is African wildlife so all the NGOs listed will have major projects within African countries and yes most have projects that protect apes. I am in no way connected to any of these organisations I just know the work they do is important.   *\*\*This is not financial advice; I am not a financial advisor just a gibbon with a keyboard. Please do your own research when donating to any charities\*\**      1.**Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International** 🦍  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/o0udahyzyzm61.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2170df1b447db3f040140a69b58e99a134b60694  [https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/GeneralDonatecopy1/index.html](https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/GeneralDonatecopy1/index.html)  These guys a popular choice to choose when sponsoring endangered apes directly on here. Funding goes directly to anti-poaching/research/education and local communities (highly important). Their C.E.O has already thanked WSB personally:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a\_message\_to\_wsb\_from\_the\_director\_of\_the\_dian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/)  If they can be a Gorila stronghold for 50 years you can hold till we get to the moon 💎🙌🚀   &amp;#x200B;  **2. Virunga National Park** 🦍  [https://virunga.org/support-us/donate/](https://virunga.org/support-us/donate/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/e00e8la1zzm61.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=296c4bea10af2c117377c22e5dbd3f6eb9d0a333  This is personal: Earlier this year 6 gorilla rangers were shot and killed here on January 12th  in an ambush. There are poor countries in Africa, then there’s the Congo – it receives very little help and small donations would be a huge fucking help. You can choose to adopt a fellow ape and the money would go towards helping the entire park protect our brothers and sisters.     **3. African Parks**  [https://www.africanparks.org/donate](https://www.africanparks.org/donate)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/g5rjoam4zzm61.png?width=216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19ef791bdd29f5ca7f96d0b2376914b6ecd97281  These guys are kings in what they do and probably the most important on this list. They're taking long term control of natural areas across the continent and provide protection and management to over 40,000 square miles (roughly the size of Germany). Their work involves all aspects of park management, from research projects to anti-poaching. Africa parks will be responsible for preserving green spaces in Africa for years to come.      **4. Frankfort zoological society**  🦍  [https://fzs.org/en/donate-now/?form=](https://fzs.org/en/donate-now/?form=)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/b0chb6n5zzm61.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42f8efafd74c2308c9c7fc7ebcfbc554138da544  In honour of HeyItsPixeL FZS is a German-based NGO with a focus on conserving biodiversity and protecting wilderness areas through multiple projects around the globe – a really efficient organisation and industry renown for effective strategies.      **5. Endangered wildlife trust**   [https://www.ewt.org.za/campaigns/ewt-donations/](https://www.ewt.org.za/campaigns/ewt-donations/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kgyjkag6zzm61.jpg?width=165&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8146b9cda84aa65be0130387cbf99afe83abe20  If you guys are lucky enough to go and see wild predators in Africa in 20 years it’ll be largely due to the work these guys do. This South Africa NGO uses applied research to maintain predator and bird of prey species populations within and around protected areas. Projects are primarily in South Africa but are expanding to other African countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. Personally working for these guys would be my dream job.    **6. Elephants Without Borders**  [https://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/](https://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/st1m01a7zzm61.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c913baa6af4b0b1df3293cda3d651b40ac6d2f5  I’ve seen a couple of elephants been sponsored in the name of GameStop and would love to nominate this NGO as a candidate for anyone willing. Primarily these guys operate within Botswana (the country with the highest population of elephants in the world and also known for its  💎's). The African elephant population is bearish, to say the least – these guys are doing great things to try and bring it back up.  &amp;#x200B;  **7. Naankuse Foundation Wildlife Sanctuary**  [https://naankuse.com/donate/](https://naankuse.com/donate/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/7q2t4eo8zzm61.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5152baa9f2c6fc683b5e72c6b2b60a8782ecb5fa  This is the only wildlife sanctuary that I know of that I would put on the list. Naankuse started by saves predators (mainly cheetahs) that have been captured by farmers that would otherwise shoot them for eating their livestock. Now they’ve grown into a huge ecotourism organisation that I would recommend volunteering with if you want to get up close with African wildlife.  &amp;#x200B;  **8. Jane Goodall Institute** 🦍  [https://janegoodall.nationbuilder.com/donate](https://janegoodall.nationbuilder.com/donate)  &amp;#x200B;  [Someone change that leaf to a diamond](https://preview.redd.it/ke4jmgfazzm61.jpg?width=460&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bd299b99936f67afc0d2e31e2c8920fce17b6ef)  Finishing the list with the queen of Primatology herself Jane Goodall. The institute provides sanctuaries in multiple countries for apes that have been affected by poaching or wildlife conflict for rehabilitation and hopefully release.  Jane Goodall herself has made a huge impact on ape populations across Africa and probably responsible for countless wild populations of chimpanzees  &amp;#x200B;  **Final appreciation**  I wanted to thank you all of you apes – I’ve chosen a field of work that I love but will never make me rich but when GME takes off, I’ll continue perusing my dream of helping African wildlife but after visiting different galaxies onboard the monkey expresses I’ll be able to contribute way more than I ever could thanks to you guys.

Will be buying more when the stimmy hits.   **What is** **Daré** **Bio?**  Daré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s health. The company’s mission is to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility.  **Why this stock hit my radar/why you should care:**  Daré just recently announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of a one-time treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The treatment, DARE-BV1, received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and, based on the topline results of the trial, Daré said it planned to file a new drug application in the first half of 2021. This has further attracted analysts and larger investors to keep their eyes on Daré in the upcoming months as it could be used massively later in 2021.  The condition affects approximately 21 million women in the United States, usually in their reproductive years, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352279). The condition, which generally doesn’t cause complications, can, however, lead to preterm birth or increase the risk of infertility due to infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes.  **Products in the Pipeline: (Information here is quoted directly from the company's website)**  ***Ovaprene*** **(CURRENTLY OBSERVING DATA FROM PHASE 3)**  Ovaprene is a hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive designed to provide contraception over multiple weeks by releasing a locally acting agent which impedes sperm motility, coupled with a unique knitted polymer barrier that physically blocks sperm from entering the cervical canal. The novel combination of these complementary approaches has the potential to produce efficacy consistent with existing short-acting hormone birth control options (pills, patches, vaginal ring), without the use of hormones.  In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.  **NOTES FOR THIS ONE:**  THIS PRODUCT IS HUGE IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL. I cannot express how many women struggle due to contraceptives altering their hormones. Birth control medications ranging from pills to IUDS alter women's hormones causing a laundry list of issues such as weight gain, health complications, and mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc.). If this product is successful, it will be the FIRST in women's contraception to create a product like this that can be administered monthly for women. There is only one other product that really exists that women can use for hormone-free contraception, and that is a specific type of an IUD. HOWEVER, IUDs are EXTREMELY painful, and I am sure many women will prefer Ovaprene as it is additionally self-administered.  ***SILDENAFIL CREAM*** **(CURRENTLY IN PHASE 2b CLINICAL TRIALS)**  Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is the inability to reach or maintain a sufficient physical response to sexual stimulation. An estimated 16% of women ages 21 to 60, or approximately 10 million women in the U.S., are distressed from experiencing symptoms of low or no sexual arousal and are seeking a solution to improve their condition. To put the market opportunity for an FDA-approved FSAD treatment in context, the prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction (ED) in men is estimated to be about 5% of men at age 40, increasing to about 15% at age 70.  Still, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for FSAD. Orally administered sildenafil received FDA approval in 1998 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and is marketed under the brand name Viagra®. Given the underlying pathophysiologic similarities of ED and FSAD, using sildenafil to direct blood to the genitals before sexual activity could provide a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience for women as it does in men.  Our localized, proprietary formulation of sildenafil cream, 3.6% (topical cream, sildenafil), has been designed specifically for women. The targeted application of this cream to the genital tissue is designed to increase local blood flow without the associated systemic exposure and side effects, leading to an improvement in overall sexual experience and response.  ***DARE-BV1*** **(SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PHASE 3 TRIALS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS)**  Bacterial vaginosis is the most common type of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. In the U.S. alone, bacterial vaginosis is estimated to affect approximately 21 million women. While there are several orally and vaginally delivered therapeutic interventions indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, currently approved options in the U.S. have relatively insufficient clinical cure rates, require sequential daily administrations or can be otherwise inconvenient for women to use.  DARE-BV1 is a thermosetting vaginal gel formulated with clindamycin phosphate 2% designed for prolonged, localized release of the antibiotic.  **Upcoming Products:**  I'm going to be quite honest here, there are a TON of diverse products that this company is currently working on to counter sexual disorders and health complications involving sexual activity. They are additionally looking into contraceptives for Males as well. This company currently has many of these products in the pre-trials stage, but they are committed to continuing research for the benefit of people's health.  **Previous Drop in Price:**  One thing I think many people will look at and question is the 5-year chart for Daré; this stock used to trade at $33/share back in 2017. However, after the acquisition of another company known as Cerulean, Daré conducted a 10 to 1 reverse split which I think additionally scared off investors. Not to mention, COVID additionally further spiked the price down along with other stocks in 2020 as well.  **Upcoming Catalysts:**  &amp;#x200B;  1. On March 25th, Dare will announce their Q4 earnings (pre-market). Based on their positive phrase 3 clinical results, this is predicted to be a positive earnings call with further products hopefully entering phase 3 trials soon. 2. Dare is further participating in two upcoming conferences to debut their products to large investors.  &amp;#x200B;  * Conference #1: **33rd Annual Roth Conference (March 15th)** \[This is the same conference that companies like *Assertio* will be presenting at.\] * Conference #2: **M Vest and Maxim Group Inaugural Emerging Growth Virtual Conference (March 17 &amp; 18)** * Conference #3: **BIO-Europe Spring Digital (March 22 - 25)**  1. **Results for clinical trials on Ovaprene.**  &amp;#x200B;  * \*\*Ovaprene is currently in the process to enter clinical trials which are already looking successful. The following is quoted from the DARE website: ""\*\*In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.""  Something to pull away from this is that they are spreading awareness continuously during this month about their successful trials and upcoming products. Partners and investors are their major concern at the moment, and this is a great opportunity for them to pull in potential partners/investors based on previous successes.  **My Take**  Obviously I recommend you all do your own DD, but this company has the potential to blow up over the course of 2021 with its price target being moved to the $5 - 9 range.

I was so lost.  Until I got into GME early January with my last $800.  Today, thanks to the meme stocks we love, I paid off the $13,000 high interest credit card burden, with over $40,000 remaining in long term investments.   I can't begin to express how free I feel.

The company where I had been working for the past 12 years decided to do a “strategic restructure” at the end of last year, and I lost my job right before Christmas.   On top of that, right around New Year’s I got into a accident. I made a full recovery (at least physically), but, because I lost my health benefits just a couple of weeks prior, I was left with a devastating hospital bill.   I only had $3000 in my bank account with no new income coming in. I wasn’t sure how much longer I would be able to pay my rent for and faced the very real possibility of having to live out of my car for awhile. I became more and more desperate, so I spent entire days from morning to night spamming my resume to every company I came across on LinkedIn and researching ways to make money quickly. It was during this time that I discovered this subreddit — I’m sure you can see where this is heading.   FOMO is hell of a drug. With the GME hype in full force, I decided to go with the equivalent of a fourth quarter Hail Mary. I set aside $500 for food and in case of emergencies and then threw the remaining $2500 entirely into the stock. I knew I only had a few days before I needed to pay rent for the next month, so the date when I made this do-or-die decision was deeply imprinted into my mind — January 27th.   I didn’t buy exactly at the top of the peak, but I was close enough to it. I haven’t told anyone this (not even my family), but on February 1st, the day the stock plummeted and closed at $90, I cried for the first time in 20 years.   By the time the stock bottomed out around $40, there were days when I seriously questioned whether life was worth continuing to live. Joy felt more and more like a distant memory and I started battling with serious bouts of depression, but thankfully there were two things that greatly helped me get through this period.   The first was the kindness of people around me — my buddy who let me crash on his couch, the owner of a local restaurant who would save leftovers for me so that I didn’t have to make the choice between spending money or going hungry the next day, an ex-colleague who set me up with a job interview. I cannot properly express the level of gratitude that I feel for these people. For them, it might have just been a simple act of generosity, but for me it made a world of difference.   The second was this community. Even though you are all retards, you convinced me that there was no point in selling at 15% of the price I bought in at. I definitely could have used those $200-300 to help me through those rough times, but you inspired me to HODL throughout the so-short-but-so-long month of February. It was truly Lambo or food stamps, and unfortunately it looked like the food stamps were going to win.   Then it all changed. I started a new job last Monday with a 30% pay increase over what I was getting before. Apparently, the longer you work at a company, the longer they can get away with underpaying you. And then yesterday, even after all the short attacks, it finally happened — the stock closed just above the price I had paid back in January.   Things are looking up and now that I’m “safe,” have I learned my lesson? Hell no! I want Melvin and Citadel to pay for what they’ve done, not just to me but to all of the people out there whose livelihoods they’ve destroyed and whose dreams they’ve crushed with their shady underhanded tactics.   They’ve been playing by their own rules for too long, and now that we are finally beating them at their own game, they are shaking in their boots. We have them on the ropes now, boys.

I will touch upon US monetary policy, politics, treasury bonds, and the equities market in broad terms, and only as they relate directly to this thesis.  First, we will examine economic metrics which illustrate the magnitude of the Great Depression, and how they compare with the present day COVID-19 pandemic.   &amp;#x200B;    **US Unemployment Rate from 1890 – 2020**  [Figure 1. Source: Washington Post \(Unemployment rate jumps to 14.7 percent, the worst since the Great Depression - The Washington Post\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=844&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86045b9cccaf138fb68b08ccab0510e1232333a0)  &amp;#x200B;  **Annual Growth of Real GDP in the US from 1930 – 2020**   *Processing img mbkd19n129m61...*  &amp;#x200B;  These two charts and metrics alone cannot express the nature of despair faced by the US during the Great Depression, which persisted for a full decade. Entire textbooks are dedicated to this topic, large portions of which are mandatory reading as part of the US public school curriculum.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) is a link to the Wikipedia page for the Great Depression if you want to learn more.  The Great Depression caused economic ripples across the world and became a cautionary chapter in US economic history. Since then, numerous US federal economic policies have been put in place to soften volatility and prevent another economic depression.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **The New Deal:**  What followed the Great Depression was the largest economic expansion in US history, with annual real GDP growth reaching almost 20% in the early 1940s (figure 1). This growth is attributed primarily by historians to the policies enacted under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which are referred to collectively as “The New Deal.” The New Deal was essentially a massive federal stimulus which included things like the formation of the FDIC, SEC, mortgage relief programs, social security, public infrastructure projects, national park expansions, and many other policies intended to put Americans back to work. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) is a link to the Wikipedia page for “The New Deal” if you want to learn more.   In contrast to The New Deal, were the policies enacted by President Herbert Hoover, prior to FDR entering office. President Hoover’s policies are generally perceived by historians as underwhelming, ineffective or poorly coordinated, giving rise to the memorable term “Hooverville.” Contributing to Hoover’s blunted policies were a divisive US political climate, with many at the time of Hoover’s presidency characterizing government stimulus as “free handouts.” These Hoover policy failures set the stage for FDR to enact the New Deal with very little resistance, rescuing the US economy from the Great Depression.   &amp;#x200B;  **COVID-19 and Present Day America:**  Fast forward to April of 2020, where US unemployment rate spikes to 14.7% (figure 1), the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. Millions of Americans are out of work, so the US government dusts off the medicine cabinet of economic prophylaxis in the form of federal stimulus.  Within a matter of months, the Federal Reserve drops interest rates to the lowest value in American history, and the US government issues direct deposit stimulus payments to Americans. While these stimulus policies are enacted relatively quickly when compared with the Great Depression era, divisive political rhetoric still permeates US politics, with many calling the COVID-19 stimulus measures “free handouts.”  In early 2021, Donald Trump loses presidential re-election to Joe Biden, and the Republican Senate majority is reduced to a 50-50 split, with Vice-President Kamala Harris as the democratic tiebreaker.    Within two months of taking office, President Joe Biden’s Congress passes another set of federal stimulus policies, totaling $1.9T. When added to stimulus measures passed by the Trump administration, the US has now received the greatest economic stimulus since The Great Depression.     Once considered overly optimistic, President Biden’s agenda of domestic infrastructure projects, technological development, and energy innovation now seem imminent; setting the stage for the largest US economic expansion since “The New Deal.”  tl:dr I am bull.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9493185.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wo5i0IAuHxFGOSGgeUCZmdlE9pEuxIePOZ4b_5PRe1w.jpg|Thesis for the Largest US Economic Expansion in Modern History Since The New Deal|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m263j5/thesis_for_the_largest_us_economic_expansion_in/|some_ads|7.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'iNhsBj3U5nyzrTLT2kDFqjdS5g1UZw5LNt-FJ0NeSK0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 140, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d58e52ec9c7d4dec7d77e50d2480460b3028ec3', 'width': 108}, {'height': 280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4616c155219f6cf0d213128939f430c10c43aec6', 'width': 216}, {'height': 416, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c488048a55ac462f216772c60f343ba73816ca5', 'width': 320}, {'height': 832, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c616da8549510e30095ac96839c120639e3c029', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1248, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8749748b62bf2c9e51d3522e1ea4a65e6c3fe5b1', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1404, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0af7c5bd225d70ef01a88fdbfa9cde9482005001', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1560, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BAE52GflS89IIV1t0wKBuTFWuHHX3kdTH_bTFElkRXw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f0d236250f598f9e300eb3a6653e597f896bcb48', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}|{'3ca83kww19m61': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '3ca83kww19m61', 'm': 'image/jpg', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d751686625e536dcc99a4849c30f823beb233ac3', 'x': 108, 'y': 83}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1984f783e549252815c2c3bd3b833e54ffc34d39', 'x': 216, 'y': 166}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01712f0289f80e8bc56e97739ca1bb3d8d277c84', 'x': 320, 'y': 247}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dac967aac9da93fb7fec8b63ce1c7bf5613c2207', 'x': 640, 'y': 494}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=844&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86045b9cccaf138fb68b08ccab0510e1232333a0', 'x': 844, 'y': 652}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'mbkd19n129m61': {'status': 'unprocessed'}}|108.0|140.0||||||||||||||||||2021-03-10|EXPR

What risks you see here, that the Hedgefonds could use to scam us again?   ——-   Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC) — make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated. Why is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans. The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations. The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. Over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed — the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world. A Glossary of Illogical Terms — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. Broker Dealer or Prime Broker — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker. Hedge Funds — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds. Market Maker — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting. Short Seller — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.” The Securities and Exchange Commission — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse. Depository Trust Clearing Corp — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later. Short Sale — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back. This relatively simple process is perfectly legal – so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner. Disclosed Short — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. Naked Short — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud. Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share. Fails–to–Deliver — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued. Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share). Options — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). This report is only going to deal with calls; they are an integral part of short manipulations. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit. Naked call — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list.  How The System Transacts Stocks — This explanation has been greatly simplified in the interest of brevity.  Customers — These can be individuals, institutions, hedge funds and prime broker's house accounts. Prime Brokers — They both transact and clear stocks for their customers. Examples of prime brokers include Goldman Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Citigroup; Morgan Stanley; Bear Stearns, etc. The DTCC — This is the holding company that owns four companies that clear and keep track of all stock transactions. This is where brokerage accounts are actually lodged. The DTC division clears over a billion shares daily. The DTCC is owned by the prime brokers, and, as a closely held private enterprise, it is impenetrable. It actively and aggressively fights all efforts to obtain information regarding naked shorting, with or without a subpoena.  Stocks clear as follows: If customer A–1 purchases ten shares of XYZ Corp and Customer A–2 sells ten shares, then the shares are transferred electronically, all within prime broker A. Record of the transaction is sent to the DTC. Likewise, if Investor A–1 shorts ten shares of XYZ Corp and Investor A–2 has ten shares in a margin account, prime broker A borrows the shares from account A–2 and for a fee lends them to A–1. If Customer A–1 sells shares to Customer B–2, in order to get the shares to B–2 and the money to A–1, the transaction gets completed in the DTC. The same occurs for shares that are borrowed on a short sale between prime brokers. As a practical matter, what happens is prime broker A, at the end of the day, totals all of his shares of XYZ owned and all of the XYZ shares bought and sold, and clears the difference through the DTC. In theory, at the end of each day when all of the prime brokers have put their net positions in XYZ stock through the system, they should all cancel out and the number of shares in the DTC should equal the number of shares that XYZ has sold into the market. This almost never happens, because of the DTC stock borrow program which is discussed later.  Who are the Participants in the Fraud? The participants subscribe to the theory that it is much easier to make money tearing companies down than making money building them up, and they fall into two general categories: 1) They participate in the process of producing the counterfeit shares that are the currency of the fraud and/or 2) they actively short and tear companies down. The counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.  The identity of the shorts is somewhat elusive as the shorts obscure their true identity by hiding behind the prime brokers and/or hiding behind layers of offshore domiciled shell corporations. Frequently the money is laundered through banks in a number of tax haven countries before it finally reaches its ultimate beneficiary in New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, etc. Some of the hedge fund managers who are notorious shorters, such as David Rocker and Marc Cohodes, are very public about their shorting, although they frequently utilize offshore holding companies to avoid taxes and scrutiny. Most of the prime brokers have multiple offshore subsidiaries or captive companies that actively participate in shorting. The prime brokers also front the shorting of some pretty notorious investors. According to court documents or sworn testimony, if one follows one of the short money trails at Solomon, Smith Barney, it leads to an account owned by the Gambino crime family in New York. A similar exercise with other prime brokers, who cannot be named at this time, leads to the Russian mafia, the Cali drug cartel, other New York crime families and the Hell's Angels. One short hedge fund that was particularly destructive was a shell company domiciled in Bermuda. Subpoenas revealed the Bermuda company was wholly owned by another shell company that was domiciled in another tax haven country. This process was five layers deep, and at the end of the subterfuge was a very well known American insurance company that cannot be disclosed because of court–ordered sealing of testimony. Most of the large securities firms, insurance companies and multi–national companies have layers of offshore captives that avoid taxes, engage in activities that the company would not want to be publicly associated with, like stock manipulation; avoid U.S. regulatory and legal scrutiny; and become the closet for deals gone sour, like Enron.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9387440.0|public|confidence|self|READ READ READ - Before they take the Website offline — This is how the wallstreet system works|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwhj8t/read_read_read_before_they_take_the_website/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-03-03|EXPR

In the last hour of trading today, we saw large purchases of GME, EXPR, AMC, NAKD, SNDL stocks.  These purchases most likely came from the MM who bought due to the volume of Call/Put Options on the stock.  With the release of the Short Interest report to the public in the after-hours trading session, the MM took proactive steps to leverage risk. The MM has to hold a number of shares as they see fit to support volatility trading due to people's awareness of the short interest, the volume of stock trading, and other factors.  This chart shows a good example of the other factors.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=883326e96ff4abb3539a2ef284f794279456c5f6|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9313579.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8GGii9hvWYOsiw2XcXAUNyjLcNWEcfYqPwW3THHUaeU.jpg|Large Purchases of GME, EXPR, AMC, NAKD, SNDL last hour of today's market closing|2.0|[]|0.96|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls00pp/large_purchases_of_gme_expr_amc_nakd_sndl_last/|some_ads|7.0|||{'xrqe0r2nhkj61': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'xrqe0r2nhkj61', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f2e0a07a697cf4d2b0bdb4c3d047c9e9743a247', 'x': 108, 'y': 60}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc0c9eb387d22481885d031cfc5cfd2bc93f6433', 'x': 216, 'y': 121}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fafa9bba7b3dcfbdaaed24edacf582a1734892f', 'x': 320, 'y': 180}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59fc8894c757636b68a49d9cf4a204e7bf133016', 'x': 640, 'y': 360}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8d955cb12d9c89205ce961d9ae893e3c4e5283e', 'x': 960, 'y': 540}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/xrqe0r2nhkj61.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=883326e96ff4abb3539a2ef284f794279456c5f6', 'x': 965, 'y': 543}, 'status': 'valid'}}|78.0|140.0|1614234710.0|||||||||||||||||2021-02-25|EXPR

The company has 40 stores in 11 states, and it expects to increase its footprint to 55 stories in 15 states this year. As it expands, GrowGeneration’s stores are getting larger, and it is looking to build more distribution hubs. The company recently signed a 50,000-square-foot lease in Miami, and it is in the process of signing a lease of the same size in Los Angeles. Each distribution hub supports commercial and online fulfillment while also acting as a retail store.  GrowGeneration is the Industry leader in commercial sales and large-scale grow design.

(2000-2014) - 25 years experience in consumer products, business development &amp;amp; brand marketing - BBA from Temple University  Darren Lampert - *CEO and Co-Founder* - Partner at Law Firm Lampert &amp;amp; Lampert (1987-2000) - Independent Portfolio Manager (2000-2014) - Holds a BS from Ithaca College and a JD from Bridgeport University School of Law  Tony Sullivan - *Chief Operating Officer, Executive VP* - 20+ years at Foot Locker Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Forman Mills - Senior Vice President Operations for Dollar Express - Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Aimee Lines  &gt;Lampert and Salaman founded the company in 2014 and have stood at its helm since then, a continuity of leadership that Lampert considers relatively rare in the **cannabis space**. He brings his experience as a securities attorney and from Wall Street to the CEO role. The two business partners started the company with the intention of taking it public. Ultimately, they want to make GrowGeneration the largest hydroponics chain in the country.  While Lampert and Salaman remain at the head of the company, GrowGeneration has added new talent to its team. Tony Sullivan joined the company as COO at the end of 2019, bringing with him 30 years of big-box store experience. Last year, Michael Goldman joined the company as Vice President of Store Operations and Loss Prevention, playing an important role as GrowGeneration purchases and builds out more stores.  GrowGeneration has 450 employees right now, and Lampert expects that number to grow to 500 soon. The company emphasizes working at GrowGeneration as a career rather than just a job. It offers its employees 401ks, option plans and health insurance.  **San Diego Hydroponics Acquisition**  This morning, GrowGeneration [Acquired San Diego's Leading Hydroponics Supplier, Expands Footprint in Southern California](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/growgeneration-acquires-san-diegos-leading-130000858.html).   Acquisition Brings Number of GrowGen Locations Nationwide to 50  &gt;""Southern California is a priority market for GrowGeneration, and we are excited to add San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics to our ever-expanding footprint there,"" said Darren Lampert, GrowGen's CEO. ""As the leading hydroponics supplier, San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics strategically positions GrowGen to conveniently provide our services to commercial growers in the Southern California market.""  Founded in 2001 by Todd Kent, San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics first opened its doors with an 800-square-foot store in Pacific Beach, California. Since then, San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics has expanded to four locations with more than 20,000-square-feet of retail space and 20 employees, who will join GrowGeneration's team of over 500 grow professionals as part of the transaction.  **GrowBiz and Grassroots Hydroponics Acquisitions**  GrowGeneration also recently acquired [GrowBiz](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growgeneration-completes-acquisition-of-the-growbiz-301175338.html) and [Grassroots Hydroponics](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growgeneration-acquires-california-based-grassroots-hydroponics-expands-footprint-in-southern-california-301192595.html). GrowBiz was the third largest hydroponic gardening chain in the country, which brings a significant competitor into the GrowGeneration fold, according to Lampert. This acquisition is helping the company to expand its presence in northern California, and it brings with it significant talent and $50 million in profitable revenue, and it added industry veteran Ross Haley, the founder of GrowBiz, as an advisor.  &gt;In 2020, most of the company’s commercial revenue was generated by East Coast operations. The GrowBiz acquisition, as well as the Grassroots Hydroponics deal, is a part of the company’s push to create a larger West Coast presence. Grassroots Hydroponics is a three-store chain outside of Los Angeles that will also serve as a part of that West Coast strategy. It has been in business for more than a decade and does $20 million in business, according to Lampe.  **GrowGeneration Hemp Corp**  In September 2018, [GrowGeneration Opened Hemp Corp to Sell Agricultural Products to Hemp Farms](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growgeneration-opens-hemp-corp-to-sell-agricultural-products-to-hemp-farms-300710081.html)  for the purpose of  developing and selling hemp agricultural products to the growing number of hemp farms in the U.S. Information compiled by states and industry, indicates that there were more than 25,500 acres of hemp production in 2017, up from 9,770 acres in 2016. In 2017, there were 1,420 registered or licensed growers and 32 universities conducting hemp research nationwide. Currently, GrowGen services over 2,000 acres of hemp farms, with cultivators that include International Hemp Exchange, Liberty Tree CBD and Green Tara Farms to name a few.  - Focused sales efforts targeting the 1,000's of hemp farms around the country. Today, Colorado, Kentucky, New York and Oregon have the most licensed hemp acres in production. - Develop and sell products with hemp will include a line of mulch, top soils for organic pest elimination, weed suppression and soil additives. - Obtaining distribution rights to equipment that delivers more automation and cost savings to process the whole hemp plant. - Form supply chain relationships and deliver value add services, particularly focused on the extraction of hemp-derived oils and hemp by-products.  **Ecommerce**  The company launched its ecommerce operations in the fall of 2018. That division has grown from approximately $2 million to $12 million, and Lampert expects it to exceed $20 million this year.  In addition to generating revenue, ecommerce operations serve as an effective marketing tool for the company. The GrowGeneration website, which offers resources like how-to videos, receives more than 200,000 unique visitors. The website provides lead generation for the company’s stores, and GrowGeneration is starting to connect its online service to its stores with online ordering and in-store pickup.  **Recent Financials**  HIGHLIGHTS  1) Record 2020 Revenue of $192 Million, Up 140% 2) Same-Store Sales Up 63% 3) 2021 Revenue Guidance Raised to $335 million-$350 million 4) 2021 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance Raised to $38 million – $40 million 5) Projected Number of Operating Garden Centers in 2021 Increased to 55  [GrowGeneration](https://growgeneration.com/?_vsrefdom=adwords&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA7NKBBhDBARIsAHbXCB4K2xeng71qXeTsoyY5dDll3imPWiSKr4p0cgnMW8rlq_OZSTIkQRUaAicsEALw_wcB)   Stay safe &amp;amp; GLTA!  *I am not a financial advisor, so please do your own DD*"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9284600.0|public|confidence|self|GrowGeneration Corp - A Unique Play on Cannabis ($GRWG)|0.0|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqyt2i/growgeneration_corp_a_unique_play_on_cannabis_grwg/|some_ads|7.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 't7OB4gcNYannCneyoQVowluxSjx5Usl7FGuaEmcTw8o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 37, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/IwyQ0ZAdlMgq-fygKT3V0bA2TzcKVJnJej-Yeijy5aU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=538f5dccc7b93ccd162e012c1267b78224692123', 'width': 108}, {'height': 75, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/IwyQ0ZAdlMgq-fygKT3V0bA2TzcKVJnJej-Yeijy5aU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94eb6638a64edfceb7c9ef179843c92b26b1c52f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 111, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/IwyQ0ZAdlMgq-fygKT3V0bA2TzcKVJnJej-Yeijy5aU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01794b45941e6689d47049b335c665bebee0e266', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 139, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/IwyQ0ZAdlMgq-fygKT3V0bA2TzcKVJnJej-Yeijy5aU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=24cd87cfd1cb05ae67d17e417a9ba53a80d65833', 'width': 400}, 'variants': {}}]}||||1614132622.0|45b14952-0d2e-11ea-8d6d-0e9a93171619||||||||||||||||2021-02-24|EXPR

Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, February 23, 2021-  *****  # [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)  *****  &gt; # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues  &gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.  &gt; * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.  &gt; * The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.  *****  &gt; # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week  &gt; * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.  *****  &gt; # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again  &gt; * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.  &gt; * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.  *****  &gt; # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results  &gt; * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.  &gt; * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.  *****  &gt; # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public  &gt; * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nh32H4C.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wWFBkUD.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GqC0Wpr.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/rKXZEUq.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/X3QHyB3.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Xj9NIWe.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ceMrg4D.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JwEoQ16.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/roUylhe.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttppoOf.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LwYb3Ms.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gs9zcaT.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aBr8P6f.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-home-depot-palo-alto-networks-shopify-amc.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Home Depot (HD)** – The home improvement retailer beat quarterly estimates by 3 cents with earnings of $2.65 per share.

The more I research the stock the more I like.  What is $ozon?   Ozon.ru is pretty much Amazon copy cat, that was around for years . I grew up in Russia, and back in a day they were just an online bookstore   They IPOed this year , they didn't get much buzz, but it caught  my eye after realizing how much they grew.   They are unprofitable as of right now , but they invested heavily into building up delivery system infrastructure to speed up delivery process.   Thing I remember about Russia , is their mail system freaking sucks. Its like USPS but 100x worse . Can you imagine, cold Russia , and your mailman is some old woman who just carries mail (literally no truck , just old woman ) , that walks from post office on her two feet rain/snow and covers decent size area ( Район in Russian  ).   So obviously express delivery is out of the question, so ozon builded up infrastructure of carriers, pick up locations,  warehouses in major cities .... so now they can cover most of the Russia with 2 day delivery without relying on Russian mail service, which is one smart investment .

Today we saw the House Committee on Financial services address the recent situation on $GME. I don't know about you guys, but for the first time in my life I was excited to watch our government (attempt to) do their job. I got on the subreddit and was met with a similar wave of enthusiasm and interest. But I also saw something else: Cynicism. There's a good chunk of us who don't really believe that congress will do their jobs. People went out of their way to point out conflicts of interest and even referred back to '08.   People are entitled to their own opinion, such is the WSB way. But I would like to express how much I disagree with the cynics and how hopeful I am with what has transpired in the financial markets, and the world these last few months.  **Individual** investors from all across the world shared research, data, their sentiments and theses with the world here on our forum. This community found the opportunity of a lifetime and we held on with conviction, and solidarity the likes of which I have never in my life seen before. We took on the giants of the financial world and made them taste blood. We exposed ***ONCE AGAIN*** the dangers of unregulated financial markets and the dangerous levels of leverage these sOpHiStIcAtEd iNvEsToRs use and justify. We exposed a systemic risk in the system and we caught the attention of media the world over.   Even still, with shills and bots flooding our home we held. With fear, uncertainty and doubt sweeping across investors all across the world we held. We cost the greedy billions and collectively along with our Institutional long allies made billions in the process. We shook the finance world to it's core.   Some truly savant level autists among us predicted the short squeezes, the gamma squeezes, the imminent collapse of the financial markets! A good chunk of these predictions were accurate. I'll link the original prediction posts here if I can find them, but in the meanwhile take a look at this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-18/peterffy-markets-came-close-to-breaking-amid-gamestop-turmoil-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-18/peterffy-markets-came-close-to-breaking-amid-gamestop-turmoil-video).  That's right. We nearly collapsed the entire American financial system. All because we spotted the opportunity of a lifetime and held. At the end of the day you know what happened. This isn't a fairytale and we were screwed out of our ticket to the moon. Now before I continue with all this sentimental bullshit lets analyze today's hearing.  **The Hearing**  Today's hearing was definitely interesting. We saw some politicians give in and throw softball questions, but we also saw others grow a spine and start turning the screws. There was a lot of talk about new financial transaction taxes aiming to take down (scalpers) HFT's. We saw our representatives talk about decentralized finance, margin requirements, settlement times, the conflicts of interest certain firms had and the health and regulation of our financial markets.   Not everything was good though. Like stated earlier some politicians folded, and some were outright bribed with campaign contributions by Ken Griffin of Citadel and Vlad Tenev of RH. We saw a few fucks even talk about eliminating Dodd Frank regulations on margin. (For those of you younger autists those were the laws enacted directly following the '08 recession and aimed to limit risk in our markets).   Overall it's what you expect out of any large group of people, there were some upstanding individuals who did their duty and stood by their constituents, but there were also spineless kleptocrats who used their position and influence for gain.  I don't get the cynicism though. What did you fucks expect? Congress to issue a decree forcing these fuckers to buy back all GameStop shares at $1000 per? What matters most is that we brought attention to the underlying issues that plague our financial markets and institutions. The fight is long from over but we're making strides in the right direction.   Change doesn't happen in a day, not in a week or even a month. Hell when it comes to the change we seek; a truly free and fair financial market. It's likely going to take years, possibly decades to see the fruits of our labor.   **Other things to note/Vent about**  BIG FUCKING PROPS to our boy u/deepfuckingvalue. Keith if you're reading this homie know that you're an inspiration to us all. You had a thesis and stuck with it. A truly humble and funny guy. Loved going back and watching your YouTube videos and watching you testify today was the highlight of my year. Best of luck to you bro, whatever you end up doing, you'll always be #1 here. If it was up to me I'd petition whatever religion authorities that give out sainthoods and lobby them to make you the ***Patron Saint of Retail Traders***. The movement you started finally started shedding light on the shady tactics used to screw the little guy. And we're all the little guy. Whether you have 8 figures or 8 dollars Wall Street will try to play you for a sucker. I'll cya on the moon homie.  &amp;#x200B;  For all the annoying fucks who feel the need to antagonize GameStop investors, do the community a favor and shut the fuck up. It's our money and we can invest, gamble, make or lose it however we god damn please. No one gives a fuck that you think we're bagholders. We had the balls to risk our capital for gain, and losses are a risk we take. What especially pisses me off is the new people making snide remarks. If you weren't here pre GME you don't have the right to call us bagholders. The OGs of this sub know bagholders because we learned that shit the hard way holding puts while the economy was recovering or buying calls as it was tanking. We've played more earnings calls than you've even fucking listened to. I'm glad you fucks found this sub but try not to be insufferable.   Here at WSB our mouths water at the opportunity of high risk high reward plays. This community used to be smart people acting like retards. Now its a community of retards who think they're savants because they paperhanded at the right time or got lucky here and there. When someone makes it big we say congrats and fuck you. When someone loses big we laugh and tell them why they're retarded. If you don't add any value to the conversation in terms of data, opinion, sentiment or otherwise don't have anything clever or funny to say do us a favor and shut the fuck up.  Bit unrelated to the earlier stuff but stop sucking off Fidelity. They're the institutional investors that sold off their stake and tanked the share price. Retail stood strong. I get they're a good broker dealer and are leagues ahead of their competitors, by all means do business with them, but stop sucking them off 24/7 it's annoying.   Positions: $GME at cost basis of \~$27 per share.

We placed multiple orders, from multiple restaurants, early this morning to be delivered for family members this year.  We received confirmations for each order, with deliveries scheduled from 4:30-7:00 PM PST.  Not one of our orders was delivered (not f’n one) and each one kept shifting to the right through the app.  Instead of being able to enjoy a dinner with my wife and daughter, we spent two plus hours on the phone with Door Dash trying to resolve the issue.  All the poor people in the Philippines kept repeating from their script was how sorry they were, and how I would like to resolve the issue.  I was insistent on every order that I wanted it delivered and refused to cancel.  At that point I was told that all the restaurants (yes, all of them) are “temporarily closed” (which is total bullshit) and could be verified by going to the Door Dash app.  After adamantly telling them that I refused to cancel the order, I was placed on hold and the calls (four total) were all dropped on their end since I wouldn’t cancel.  I cannot begin to express what a cluster this was for our family (much less my wife who had to give up a day with her boyfriend to spend with me and our daughter, sorry I had to try and add some humor from being so pissed), and think there will be a ton of other people who experienced similar issues.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9049346.0|public|confidence|self|Door Dash Holders or Considering Buying|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk4tmu/door_dash_holders_or_considering_buying/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-15|EXPR

DNA vaccines hold several advantages over other modalities, including mRNA. RNA is inherently unstable. It’s naturally a transient molecule. Thus, vaccine developers need to adjust RNAs to make them last long enough beyond administration to take therapeutic effect. RNA also requires mechanisms for amplification and intervention from special enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase and RNA polymerase) that can be difficult and expensive to produce. DNA-based vaccines are simpler and have fewer technological requirements than those based on mRNA. DNA plasmids are inexpensive to produce, and DNA has greater stability than RNA. Thus, instead of fading away after a few days, administered DNA can remain in cells and continue to express target antigens for months at a time, resulting in durable protection. Using DNA also enables quick and inexpensive manufacturing of hundreds of millions of doses per year. Aegis’s capacity for 2021 is 500 million doses, and we expect that number to grow to roughly 2 billion within the next couple of years. Because DNA is stable at room temperature, Aegis Life can ship and store DNA vaccines without need for elaborate cold-chain support. We even can lyophilize the drug substance for formulation into sublingual tablets or oral capsules. We believe that about five years from now, we will have a single-dose oral vaccine that is safe and efficacious, provides durable coverage, facilitates scalable and inexpensive manufacturing, and ships at room temperature to every corner of the world, including low-income regions in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Fusogenix gene-delivery technology enables us to execute this vision.🦠|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9018128.0|public|confidence|self|INOVIO and their INO-4800 DNA COVID-19 vaccine vs. RNA vaccines|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbrjf/inovio_and_their_ino4800_dna_covid19_vaccine_vs/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-13|EXPR

I dont want to watch it again to recap her reasons I forget but I liked it when I heard it. Every one on CNBC or basically any other market analysis is all 🌈🐻 doom and gloom because FEAR SELLS! Seriously ever buy tickets to a scary movie? Some people actually want to hear that shit so thats what the put out.     That got me to thinking, what would the market look like today if greedy bankers hadn't given 5 interest only mortgages to every stripper in Vegas? Time to read charts and do mathmagic (yeah I'm actually on the spectrum and that gets my dick hard).     According to this Zack's article: [here](https://finance.zacks.com/average-return-dow-jones-during-its-lifetime-3314.html)    In the 91 years prior to 1987 the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew at an average rate of 4.3%. Overall rate over its 122 years in 5.42%, in a 25 year sample from 1987-2012 the DJ grew by 7.55%. What the fuck? Why almost double since 1987? In my personal opinion the early adoption of the personal computer by Wallstreet and the emergence of fast growth tech companies that the semiconductor gave birth to. In summary I've elected to use 7.55% for my calculations because we don't use the Pony Express or Wells Fargo to deliver stock certificates anymore(Buffett might still use WF lol).     I'm going 20 years back here for a proper trend line, and it will segue into another related analysis for the second half. Starting in Y2K, thats the year 2000 for you Gen Zs, the DJIA was 10,729.38. Now let's use that 7.55% average year over growth and forecast the Dow today vs one with no housing collapse.   DJ Current: 31,458.40  DJ No 2008: 49,746.08     The fallout from the events in 2008 set the market trend line behind by 6 and a half years on the 7.55% model. My actual analysis of the 20 year sample I used finds a 6.54%, but that includes a -33.84% drop for '08. If you remove that event the growth rockets to 8.54%. So I feel like the 7.55% model is perfectly reasonable.     In summation analysts(🌈🐻) have been screeching for the last half decade about how we are do for a market correction, and I agree! The market is attempting to correct losing a third of its value that took a century to build in one year!

Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.  Of course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.  I'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.  Fair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...  Here are some reasons:  **A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**  I won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the ""next"" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump &amp; Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.  If you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy.  **B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**  Financial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.  A company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \[1\]  1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $) 2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001766600&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0&amp;count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001766600&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0&amp;count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy. 3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \[2\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.  **C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**  This is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.  This auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials do not show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \[3\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.  **D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**  If securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.  Luckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \[4\].  This is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.  **E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)  Some guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 100,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\[redacted company name\]**,**\[redacted company name\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.  **F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**  This by itself is really pretty common and not signs of impending doom, but it's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can make turn **$20 million or so cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.  However they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.  I'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say ""Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit"". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.  **G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**  The institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.  Instead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**  By the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon. Both of which would help secure them a new loan to save their ass. I wonder why a struggling company would want their book values to look a little better with this.  **H. MAGIC NUMBER**  If all of this is lost on you, at least realize that my they potentially have a $690 million deficit, I'm my math is right.  69  What else do you need?

I just wanted to express my gratitude to everybody who contributed to the scheme and helped me to offload 1200 shares worth $38,000 at a 10% return during after-hours trading.  Alright this didn't actually happen. Well the meme actually did happen - it even made it to the front page of r/all. But I didn't actually do a pump-and-dump, although I very well could have. All throughout the day yesterday *dozens* of people commented on the meme, boasting about the hundreds of dollars of $YOLO shares they bought after seeing the meme and how they were ready to ""ride this one to the top"". Many commenters wondered if it was ""too late to get in on a piece of this"", and a few seemed to barely grasp the very basics of trading: ""How do I do this on E-Trade?"" asked one retard. ""Just Yolo'd $750. Lets get ittttt"" quipped another.  Okay so I know we're all retards, but that doesn't mean you have to be sheep too. And since when are you taking financial advice FROM A FUCKING MEME? That's all it was, a dumb silly meme pointing out how there was an ETF with the ticker $YOLO. Ha ha very funny right? Why don't you do a little goddamn research next time, and stop letting memes on the internet dictate what you do with your life savings.  Now I understand that there's recently been a huge influx of people joining WSB who are inspired by what's happening with GME and want to get rich off ThE nExT mEmE sToNk. But let me tell you that blindly throwing money at every stock you see mentioned in WSB isn't going to get you anywhere. So please, can everybody try to be at least a *little* less stupid?  Thanks for reading my rant, you dumb idiot.  (If you are one of the people who actually bought $YOLO because of the meme, don't worry you're not totally screwed. It's just not the best ETF for weed in terms of diversity and yield.

It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.  In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.  Part 1: History of Self Promotion  Part 2: The USPS Contract  Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability  Part 4: Positions or Ban  \---------------  **PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**  WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:  * [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)    * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more? * [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)    * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a ""blue chip customer.""](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)  * Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016    * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html) * Several other small examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered. * Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER. * [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)    * Let's take a look at that fine print: ""The order is split between Workhorse’s C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions."" Yeah, we'll see how that goes.  \---------------  **PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**  There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.  First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:  * Workhorse * Ford-Oshkosh * Karsan-Morgan Olsen  *I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel bull arguments below.*  Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):  1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15. 2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/) 3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney. 4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles    1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.    2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing. 5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).  So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.  I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:  &gt;“We’ve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I’ll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we’re ready for that. Now we’ve got our fingers crossed. We believe we’ve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,” John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.   &gt;   &gt;Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)  And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):  &gt;**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**   &gt;   &gt;I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS’s needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?   &gt;   &gt;**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**   &gt;   &gt;So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.   &gt;   &gt;**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**   &gt;   &gt;I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.  So USPS has the following options:  1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch. 2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).  Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]  \---------------  PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY  I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say ""Lordstown"" like it means something.  This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.  \---------------  **PART 4: YOLO**  Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts.

So I’m not expecting much from this post... but I want to share a thought. January 28th 2021 will forever be the last day I had any respect and admiration for Wall Street and Investment Banking... the blatant lies and manipulation was unbelievable and continues till this day ... yet we have “leaders” like Yellen expressing interest in investigating our thread... not the hedge funds who over shorted an entire company...and lost.  We have watched short ladder attacks, manipulation by brokers such as Robinhood, Interactive brokers and also listened to multi billionaires a complain that the retail investor shouldn’t participate in stocks because they (the billionaires) were losing...  With all that said, if they are able to coordinate and control the market I.e turning off our ability to buy stocks (while allowing themselves to trade)... short ladder attacks we see on a daily basis... and media manipulation ...  What’s wrong with us actually focusing together, discussing what are legit moves to influence our stocks upwards with proper buy strategies/timing/quantity etc?  I really want to know what’s the difference? If some smart forward thinkers here can come together and express strategies that make sense to move our stock, we should do that...   I’m tired of this, you guys have no idea how January 28th changed my life.... that was such a blatant heist /robbery and manipulation.... yet they are all waking up in their $30million dollar apartments happy and free.  Im so disappointed and I want to make a change, not roll over and make memes.... make actionable moves.  NOTE : Before I’m “investigated” for market manipulation... I haven’t said anything out of the lines of what Wall Street hedge funds are doing right now. They teamed up and made moves on the market. Also the brokers did as well - WITHOUT any regulatory request from the SEC...  Absolutely nothing wrong with us strategizing how to buy and sell a stock we love.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8661257.0|public|confidence|self|If Hedge Funds and Brokers can manipulate without consequence... why don’t we?🚀💎🖐|0.0|[]|0.7|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcoj4e/if_hedge_funds_and_brokers_can_manipulate_without/|some_ads|7.0||||||1612470989.0|||||||||||||||||2021-02-04|EXPR

I'm a username. Also, count the GME shares.   By now I think it's safe to assume that most people have sold their GME shares. Oh, I'm sure a few die-hards will jump in to tell me they're never selling, but 90% of us have moved on. That's fine.   So...what did we learn?   -----   **THE GOOD**   **Shares, Not Options**   Who would've thought, right? Oh, sure, a lot of us had a few options and made a killing off those, but the majority of the money made on GME was in shares. Obviously, the short squeeze potential drove that more than anything, but I think it's important to look at why else it worked.   GME brought in a LOT of new investors who know nothing about the market. I bet 99% of people don't know how to buy options or how they work. But anyone can buy shares. And buying shares probably saved a ton of us from buying FDs and blowing up our accounts early. So when GME was initially surging from $30 to $100, we kept buying shares instead of going for the home run.   I think that's something to keep in mind on any future plays. We all love our options, but shares were key to this for more than just the squeeze.   **We Moved the Market**   GameStop was obviously the big one, but AMC and Express were saved from bankruptcy. We brought attention to BlackBerry, which just needed a little bump and is a legitimate company. That's really cool. I love GameStop and going to the movies, and I'm glad we're not seeing more companies go under due to the virus.   We didn't do this all on our own, though. What we provided was that initial spark. Once the big guys saw what we were doing, they piled on. That's a good thing. It means they saw the same things we did, just not as early.   **We Have the World's Attention**   We dominated the world and financial news for about a week. They made jokes about us on SNL. Your grandparents know what wallstreetbets is now (a chat room, right?). The White House was monitoring the situation.   The whole world is now watching and waiting for us to decide which stock is the next big play. Even the worst DD posts now could send a stock skyrocketing because people will have severe FOMO from GME and the others.   All because we liked a stock and decided to buy it. Cool.    -----   **THE BAD**   **We Pissed People Off**  Now, we do this all the time, but it's usually limited to each other and the real world never knows about it. We pissed off short sellers, hedge funds, the media, analysts, and the SEC.   You may think, who cares? Fuck 'em. And I agree, to an extent. But together they have the power to prevent us from doing anything like this ever again.   Oh, and they all lied about us, the stock, everything. Everyone. So expect that to continue.   **People Lost Big**  I know we love our loss porn, but there were people buying-in for the first time at like $400/share. Anyone doing this was taking enormous risk, especially when a lot of us got in when the price was in the teens and averaged up to the $40s.   If this was you, you learned an expensive lesson. Don't chase.    ------    **THE UGLY**   **Hivemind Got the Best of Us**   At some point, around $300/share, we should've all taken a look at where we were at and re-assessed. I'm not blaming, because I'm guilty of it, too. We downvoted ANYONE who questioned why we weren't taking profits or had legitimate concerns about numbers that were coming out.  That's a real problem. And when the information started to turn against us (eg. the S3 short interest report), we should've known it was time to get out. Even if it was false, there were enough red flags by that point. This started out as a sure thing - 140% shorted, shorts extremely underwater, losing $, etc. Once that narrative started to shift, we risked the stock price tanking.   **New DD Will be a Mess**   Seriously. Take ANY new DD with a fucking gulp of salt, because the pumpers are coming. We made millions off of GME, and there's no doubt someone is out there just salivating at the thought of pumping up a shitty company in order to profit.   Now, more than ever, it's extremely important for you to pay attention to a poster's history and really do your own research on a company. If you're not comfortable holding shares for a long time, then don't buy the stock. I personally loved GME's potential, even without a short squeeze, due to their management and vision. My plan has always been to ride the squeeze to the top, then buy back in and hold it for years. Nothing about that has changed.   Oh, and do you want to know what the next short squeeze will be? I'll tell you right now:   **NONE.**   **THERE ARE NO MORE SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITIES SO STOP FUCKING LOOKING FOR THEM.**   If you see a post about the next short squeeze, just move on. It's not happening. Period.   You think things were bad before? Just. You. Wait.   -----    **TAKEAWAYS**   The biggest takeaway for me has been how people changed their tactics when it came to GME in particular. Buying shares was key. That was the game changer.   Additionally, people with legitimate concerns with evidence to back them up should at least be heard. It's one thing to downvote a shitpost. Quite another to laugh at someone for suggesting there might be something we're all missing.   Remember when people laughed at DFV? Sometimes it's good to listen to contrary opinions.   -----  Oh, on an unrelated note: GME shares are approaching my personal re-buy price of around $50/share. This is what I believe the stock's fair value is without any potential short squeeze. With Ryan Cohen's leadership, I think this company will have a nice turnaround. I wouldn't be surprised to see it legitimately trading at around $100-$150/share in the next year or so. Not a recommendation to buy, I just love this stock. 🚀|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8658823.0|public|confidence|self|GME: What did we learn?|1.0|[]|0.58|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lclwx5/gme_what_did_we_learn/|some_ads|7.0||||||||1.0|||||||||||||||2021-02-04|EXPR

Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that.   The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up.   Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.  They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  [Flying our tendies as you read this](https://preview.redd.it/2couglpv6hf61.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddd29a8ec3d6c527bbfc8ec8b32226525a58251)  The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.  In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.  The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.  They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet.   A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.  If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.  AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.  The company’s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.  **There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**  The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.  Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without  Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.  Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.  Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.  Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.  **Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.**   To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

But could you imagine that one of these short squeeze names not only has A LOT more room to squeeze (and hasn’t been restricted by many brokerages), but is still a **value** play even after the massive run on shorts?  That’s what we have with TR.  It’s been pointed out that TR is heavily shorted with 45% of its float short. But if you’re looking for squeeze potential, you should be paying at least just as much attention to days short: if a name has limited liquidity, the shorts will have a hard time exiting their positions regardless of the nominal short interest.  Days short on GME was just 2 as of mid-January, and even at its peak reached no higher than 25 days way back in July. AMC is just 1 day short, and reached no higher than 7 in October.  TR? It’s STILL 45 days short as of the same date.  **GME: 2 days. AMC: 1 day. TR: 45 days.** That’s higher squeeze risk by an order of magnitude going by that metric.  The shorts are 7.3m shares deep in their short positions on TR, but the stock typically trades only 125k shares per day, and it didn’t pick up nearly as much volume as the other squeeze candidates like AMC and EXPR last week. **While AMC, EXPR, etc. are up 3-4x on the squeeze trade, TR is up only 33%. But if TR even begins to make a move similar to theirs, the shorts will have a very hard time exiting due to the tight float and limited liquidity, and the stock could squeeze very, very hard.**  What makes this so potent is the mechanics of the float: just 25% of TR’s shares trade freely. Compare this to 40% for GME and AMC, and as high as 85% for BB and EXPR. There are only so many shares out there that the shorts could possibly cover.  Where are the rest of these shares? They’re with CEO Ellen Gordon, who owns 50% of the common and 85% of Class B shares. Another insider owns another 5% of the common and 15% of the Class B. Gordon has been on the board for 50 years (!) and there is no record of her selling a single share going back to 2000 at least. In fact, no insider has sold a share since 2013, and before that 2008. These are the ultimate diamond hands.  This is effectively a closely-held business that just happens to trade publicly. Worried that we might get burned by insiders like we did on AMC with Silver Lake executing the massive convert and making it easier for shorts to cover? Not here. The insiders don’t sell and the shorts will be stuck covering on the tiny float.  And compare the risk in TR to the other squeeze plays at this stage of the trade. EXPR, AMC, etc. are all up 3-4x over the past week, but are all companies that were and are under legitimate fundamental pressure (as they were even before COVID) and facing real liquidity issues, which is of course why they were so heavily shorted. TR is up just 33% on the squeeze but is absolutely fine financially. Sales have been steady and remarkably consistent at $520-550m for years, and are down just ~10% due to COVID. It has over $100m of cash on its balance sheet and no debt. It generates consistent free cash flow, which was as high as $80m last year. This is a brand that everyone knows with no real lasting fundamental pressures, and is not going away anytime soon.  The kicker? This thing probably has UPSIDE on the fundamentals. It’s very likely that company gets bought out by a strategic buyer once the long-time CEO (now 90 years old) passes away. For how much? TR did $197m of gross profit in 2019. Let’s say it gets bought out by Hershey’s, which probably shares all of TR’s distribution channels and could wipe out just about all of its (extremely bloated) sales, marketing, and administrative spend in a buyout. Tax-affect TR’s gross profit at HSY’s effective tax rate of 17%, apply HSY’s forward P/E of 22-24x, divide by 66m shares outstanding…  **…and you see that TR could easily end up getting bought out for upwards of $60 per share. And that may not be too far off.**  **So why is it still trading at $40 per share even after the run on heavily-shorted names? Beats me. But I’m buying at these levels (as is whoever made those large bullish option purchases late last Friday…).**  **TLDR: This is not just another lottery ticket short squeeze play that’s already been carried into the stratosphere. This is an early-stage squeeze that never got picked up by WSB quite as much as some of the others – and even after the once-in-a-generation broad-based squeeze, this one hasn’t reached nearly its potential given the low float and limited liquidity, which makes its days short ratio 22-45x HIGHER than the other squeeze candidates, and which will make it very, very hard for shorts to cover. TR is up just 33% while the others are up 3-4x, and it’s not even trading where it should be on the fundamentals. If you’re looking for another squeeze candidate (and one which the brokers haven’t restricted as heavily) but are antsy about how extended the high-short-interest basket might be – this is your “value squeeze” play.**  And, honestly, why didn’t this one get picked up as much by WSB? What stock could be more memable than Tootsie Roll? Everyone knows it, everyone loves it…who wouldn’t be tweeting about Tootsie if this got some play?  By the way, unlike AMC, whose theaters are closed across much of the country, TR is a company that we could support **directly** - go out and buy some Tootsie Rolls. Think about the power of the crowd that WSB showed in bringing GME stock to light and apply it to TR: **If we get just 30% of us WSB retards buying the 36-count boxes on their website for our imaginary girlfriends for Valentine’s Day, that’s over $100m in sales, more than 20% of TTM revenue.** Here’s an opportunity not just to buy the stock but to justify it on the fundamentals – by creating the fundamentals.  **TENDIES FOR DINNER TOOTSIE FOR DESSERT**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8571423.0|public|confidence|self|Serious $TR DD: This Still Has Room to Run|1.0|[]|0.78|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawos6/serious_tr_dd_this_still_has_room_to_run/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-02-02|EXPR

Hold on to your hair, and your bladder..  Late 2000s. Knotts Berry Farm. It has all the typical rides that any theme park would have. The half-pipe, the weird and fun twisty ones, and the water ride that would wet your gonads like a $20 hooker about to pass out from sucking a bunch of pp all day. “Hmm, tongue swipes..” you think to yourself. “Cool.”  You’ve just gotten off this ride and you’re about to hop on the next one, the Accelerator. Now this fucking thing. This fucking ride is something. You’ve been looking forward to this one all day. Simply put, it has the mechanics of a Tesla before Tesla’s we’re even cool. 0-60 in under 4 seconds? You think, “Shit, sign me up.” Meanwhile, your crotch is drying off from those pitiful wank-licks you just received. You’ll end up hopping on this one with dry pants and a new vigor. Among one of its characteristics is the massive vertical loop. You see people entering the ride and subsequently hold on for dear life to any part of the visibly worn metal guards as they rocket past the loading zone and scream with delight. Shouldn’t have done your hair today. It gives off the appearance of wet, freshly cut grass plumps after a ride. “Oh well..” you think to yourself.  While you’re waiting in the line for the ride, you come to notice the heat. It’s a standing heat and it really bothers you all of a sudden. Because of that, you begin to notice the smell. Oh god, some kid just farted in front of you. What you would do to give that little shit a lecture, but you can’t. His parents are right there with him. Okay, besides the heat and essence of booty particles, what els- “waiting!” Why the fuck do you and a bunch of other people commit to waiting in this godforsaken line together? Being a retard, you know you should’ve bought the express pass for an extra $20.   “Well fuck.” You have another 10 minutes before it’s your turn on the ride. “Might as well check my phone.” -a Motorola Razr. You pull it out and flex that shit in front of the crowds around you, but you realize everyone around you has one. Feelings of insecurity arise. “Damn. This phone ain’t that special..” you think to yourself as you’ve slowly inched up to the next in line on the Accelerator.   You feel a woosh of air as the rollercoaster blasts off out of the sight of everyone as they’ve entered a vertical climb to the heavens. After about a minute, the carts come back to their stationary position right in front of you. “Probably shouldn’t have put that product in my hair. Shit’s all messed up by now.” By now, you’ve totally forgotten about that sorry, fart-particle homunculus as you line up. Your crotch is nice and dry now as you adjust your pants to fit comfortably in your seat.   Your palms have begun to sweat a little bit as you make your way inside the cart. Your heart starts beating a little bit faster. When the ride operator checks with you, he asks if you’re doing all right. You choke up for a second as you make eye contact and just give him a passive thumbs up. He walks away. Eyes now back in front. They expand as you subconsciously know what’s coming. Your hearing dials in and begins to muffle out what anyone else is saying. You’re having second thoughts about this ride. Too late. You’re strapped in. Time begins to slow. You attempt to take a deep breath. Nope. You instantly feel your back get jammed into your seat as you accelerate. “Tongue swipes now?” you think as you feel a sense of warmth in that fleeting moment.  🚀|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8563731.0|public|confidence|self|Theme Park|1.0|[]|0.88|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/las6s7/theme_park/|some_ads|7.0||||||1612260310.0|||||||||||||||||2021-02-02|EXPR

And being an average retard, cruising wallstreetbets, I stumbled upon Counterfeiting Stock 2.0. I'm also bad at Reddit, so have some mercy.  In [Counterfeiting Stock 2.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20210131132731/http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) is a passage about short selling:  * **Short Sale** — **Blah Blah, you can skip to the bold part** For example: If investor S wishes to  sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S  immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has  the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the  share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes  some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”,  which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and  investor L has his share back. This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. **The  investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left  his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level.** **If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a  short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner.** *If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they  are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the  account owner.*  Get out of margin accounts on all brokerages, and turn off options that have to do with stock 'borrowing'. Quit borrowing and lending your hard earned stocks. For instance, **my WeBull app has a 'Stock Lending Income Program' that I suspect is used for these purposes**. Express consent, as said in 2.0. I turned this option off, and the status went to 'Under Review'. Under review? No bro, i opted out, its not for review as far as I'm concerned.  Not all stocks are part of the income lending program on WeBull, and they give you pennies for the stock on lend, but this paranoid retail investor thinks this shit is all connected. FSM and Titan Pharma are the two companies I have held that are part of this program which provided me with a few pennies in return for holding the stock. Look at Titan's chart.

I see all these fidelity posts out here, and maybe its time to be fancy myself and get a real brokerage.  TLDR; Dont trade on margin or use weird lending programs on apps.

I am also not a financial advisor.  Context Logic Inc, ticker WISH, is a stable, competitive alternative to Ali-Express, that has (since IPO) seen a steady incline despite market fluctuations.   With record unemployment: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html)  And Biden's plan to ""buy American"" paired with a new, stirred sense of patriotism amongst the lower to middle class, there is going to be an overwhelming influx of cheap, low cost, alternative household and every day goods. Now you're thinking, why don't they just go to amazon? Amazon's prices would be preferred had we not been in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. The alternative to going broke is budgeting effectively, and we do that by slapping on the American brand name over cheap overseas goods. Does it matter where it was made if its from an American company? The vast majority of people wouldn't bother checking or caring.  Improving free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019? Check. Monthly active user growth rising nicely? Yes. Active buyers up compared to the year-ago period? Yep.  After a significantly underperforming IPO, in my humble opinion, the company is a 6-8 bagger by EOY.

I respect the hustle but in a way kind of pisses me off. Instead of educating the fellow retard they are banking on the retard.  We are all out for tendies but at what price?  This is my second post about what I am seeing on social media and I am just trying to protect the new investor who is risking all his savings to jump in on the bandwagon.

You don't want to mix high emotions and the stock market no matter what the circumstances are. The Wallstreetbet community which has now seen its membership grow exponentially is now filled with emotionally charged language, emojis and high morale as they draw first blood from the hedge funds. They are now rallying the entire world to ""fight their cause"" by jumping into the stock. Maniac investing, sky rocketing prices, emotions, FOMO, irrationality, bubble anyone?  Financial strains are appearing in the system. Robinhood drew down all their credit lines and raised 1 billion with existing investors. Although we didn't hear from Etrade, TD Ameritrade or Interactive Brokers, we expect them to face similar stress as evident by their share trading restriction. Back in 2015, the surprise announcement by Swiss National Bank to remove the 1.20 EURCHF peg caused massive volatility that led to the insolvency of fx brokers. Brokers are built to function with certain volatility assumptions and things are fine 99.999% of the time until a Black Swan shows up. Brokers are important clogs in the stock market mechanism and they cannot afford to fail in unison. Short brokerages appear to be a good trade here.  It may not stop with GME. GME is now $320, up  10x from the beginning of the year. Mob investors who missed the boat already have other targets in their crosshairs; AMC, Express, Bed Bath Beyond and Blackberry. This will further exacerbate the problem.   Hedge funds, the villains of the industry have their fair share of failures in their storied past, but non as humiliating as this. Weak, vulnerable retail investors came to the realisation that, when well orchestrated in a community, they can take on these giants and beat them at their game. But hedge funds also serve an important role in price discovery and their sheer magnitude of their operation are a systemic risk to the markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a 3.6b bailout of LTCM in 1998 to prevent a wider collapse of the financial system. Indeed, in the 2008 subprime crisis, the suspension of 2 BNP hedge funds in the summer of 2007 also marked the precipice of the crisis before things start to unravel."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|7211286.0|public|confidence|self|GME has the potential to be something bigger|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94ktc/gme_has_the_potential_to_be_something_bigger/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-31|EXPR

I have no position on Gamestop stock at the moment and no position on the other very volatile stocks either.  I realize that this is a long post that very few people will read so **if you don't want to read all this, at least read the next paragraph :**  TL;DR : *Gamestop is very risky and most probably much riskier than you can imagine as the stock price can go back to 10 or 20 in just a day or 2. The price does not reflect the fundamentals and if suddendly people realize that they can't sell the stock at a higher price as they hope they could, nothing will justify those high prices and the stock price will collapse very quickly. (See Wirecard chart to see what I'm talking about). A lot of you accept those risks the same way a lot of you accepted the risks of investing in bit###n or any scam related to it : you're ok with it only because it's going up and will cry about it as soon as it's going down. And for the novices here, I don't think you fully grasp how insane this is right now as you have no frame of references : you see stocks skyrocketting and think that this pretty rare and I'm here to tell you that it's never happened since the dot-com bubble and i don't know if you remember but this shit didn't end well (even for good tech companies).*  Another thing : English is not my native language so sometimes I'm going to express myself poorly and I apologize for it.  Now, I want to debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin Capital :   # 1. They will have to buy at $10 000 no matter what.  False. If they have the choice between waiting (and paying interest for borrowing the stock) even for years they'll do it as it's much MUCH cheaper than buying back the stock at $10 000 or any price above $400 (that I chose completely arbitrarely). As this is (in some way) unprecedented, they will have more help from banks and other hedge funds to help them keep their positions longer until this whole situation calms itself down to prevent them from selling at a completely absurd price.  # 2. They will go bankrupt as a result of this.  Nope. They got bailed out by some hedge funds and they will get bailed out by others in the future.  To prove my point, I'm going to take the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM for short) that was in a similar situation :  - At first, they had a good strategy : they had a bunch of arbitrage that nobody really thought of and they got really great returns (they averaged 40% annually).  - Then, other hedge funds copied their strategy and the opportunities got smaller and smaller, so LTCM decided to put riskier and riskier bets. Those bets were very big positions on very illiquid markets therefore if the trade were going badly, they were losing a lot of money and to add insult to injury, since it's in illiquid markets, they would have a very hard time to get out of their positions.  - One day, a bunch of those highly leveraged positions were going down big time and LTCM could not handle it. They sold a bunch of them at highly unfavorable prices but they couldn't liquidate their positions completely.  - Then, banks, hedge funds and the fucking federal reserve decided to bail them out to prevent a major financial crisis. They gave them billions of dollars, split their positions and therefore the losses as well.  - The hedge fund did not go bankrupt and it stayed alive for a while but then they stopped completely as their creditors got paid back.  If I'm telling you that long ass story, it's because it's really similar to what's happening with Melvin Capital :   - They had a good strategy at first : shorting companies that are slowly going out of business. - Then got into riskier and riskier plays : added more into their plays in hope to manipulate the price forcing the companies that they shorted to go bankrupt. - One play went badly. - Now they're being bailed out by a few banks and this is going to happen even more until this situation stops.  Now there are a 2 differences here :  - First, the positions that LTCM had had no chance of recovering and the price was going to be like that if not lower for a long time. In the case of Melvin, the price of GME will not stay at $10 000 and probably not even $500 for very long. - And second, this is a much smaller position compared to what LTCM had back then. They had $4.6 billions of dollars in losses on highly leveraged plays, Melvin Capital doesn't have that much even with a $1000 stock price.  So what will happen in my opinion?  Melvin Capital will keep their positions as long as they have to. If the price doesn't go down, the government will probably force some stock holders or the company itself to sell the stock at a reasonable price to help them out.  # 3. This is like the 2008 crisis.  Like wtf??!   This is nowhere near like the 08 crisis. Like what are you smoking??!  The CDS (the products that they bought back then) were literally worthless and could NEVER recover. A lot of people defaulted their loan and therefore those loans could NEVER recover. The banks were leveraged 30x meaning that for every million dollars worth of defaulted loans, their losses were at 30 million dollars.  Also, the sums for the 08 crisis was much MUCH bigger than the 10 billion dollars that the company is worth right now.  Also, in the case of the 08 crisis, a lot of those products got exchanged around the world and made it a worldwide crisis.  Finally, if you think this is like that, then remember that the government bailed them out with the taxpayer's money and a lot of banks and hedge funds actually MADE MONEY from this crisis. And some banks sold those worthless products to some of their clients that lost all of their 401K.  # 4. They will have to buy it back from us.  False, I've already debunked this : they will probably ask the company to sell it at a ""fair"" price whatever that means.  But to expand on that, I want to talk about the greater fool theory as this is probably the best example of this right now.  From Investopedia :  &gt;The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.  This is obviously happening right now as some of you bought the stock at $11 and sold at $20, some bought it at this price and sold it at $100 and so on.. and some of you bought it early and kept it this whole time hoping to sell it at a much higher price.   This strategy only works if you're able to sell your security at the ""greater fool"" or in other terms, someone that is willing to pay it at a higher price.  Right now it works because everybody is hoping that the hedge funds (and mostly Melvin) will be the greater fools but they have much MUCH more ressources to go through before buying it at these ridiculous prices : manipulating the market to scare the retailers, halting the trading for the stock, preventing the retailers from buying the stock, getting bailed out by other banks, the government or the federal reserve. So i can GUARANTEE you that they will not be buying at those prices.  # 5. Shorting is criminal and should be illegal.  That's going to be short (no pun intended) : No. Shorting is a good strategy when you have a shitty company that will probably go out of business. Tell that to the ones that shorted Enron, Wirecard, or bought all those CDS (essentially shorting the housing market).  What should be prevented is abusing your shorting position to put pressure on a company and forcing them to bankruptcy as they were doing to Gamestop.   If you shorted Blockbuster, Hertz, Kodak, and many others, it wasn't criminal, it was profiting off of a dying business. If you think this is horrible to do : this is debatable but also you're basically doing the same thing by trying to squeeze them out of their positions.  # 6. The class action lawsuit will result in Robinhood going out of business. Robinhood will say that they halted buying the stock to protect their clients as this is a very volatile stock and they were not professionals. Also, they were issues with the clearing of the trades making it impossible for them to execute all those trades without impacting the trading of the rest of the securities.  Also, in the Customer Agreement, section 5-J : &gt; I understand that Robinhood may discontinue My Account and any services related to My Account immediately by providing written notice to Me.  Also, they could just lie and make bullshit claims and will get away with this because their clearing house is fucking Citadel and Citadel is pretty fucking powerful in the financial system.  # 6-bis : People leaving Robinhood will result in Robinood going out of business. Most people will not leave Robinhood.   There were countless examples of pretty fucked up things that they've done and people still use it to this day. Quote from a comment that I've made a few days ago :  &gt; After GUH moment, countless outages during very volatile moments, them using fucking Citadel (you know, the ones that gave money to Melvin to let them live a bit longer) to clear your trades, them not giving you the correct bid/ask data, the app being full of bugs, and them having a better mobile app than website, and [people] still use it??!  If after all this and way more, people still use it, people will still use it even after that because it's fun to play around in their app and now those retail traders are used to the app.  # 7. This is unprecedented, so nobody can really predict what will happen. False, a lot of those things happened before, so this situation is not precedented but the MAGNITUDE of the situation is. You could definitely predict them preventing people from buying as they're scummy af, you could predict banks to bail them out (and even more in a few days) as this has happened before with LTCM. You can predict that they will not suffer the consequences because in all scandals they never fucking do as they're so important to our system and them going out of business will collapse the whole financial system.   So here are the things that can happen :  - Gamestop is forced to sell their stock at a ""fair"" price. If they refuse, the government will threaten them with legal consequences like market manipulation or some bullshit like that (don't need to be right, just need to scare them with big consequences). - Hedge funds will give their positions to banks and banks will sell them to customers (just like in the 08 crisis). - They will be bailed out to prevent a big financial meltdown. Then, as people will realize that they will never close their position at the high price that they hoped they would, they suddendly sell their shares and the price of the stock will collapse. The hedge funds buy back the stock at a low price. They make money in the process and a lot of retails lose their life savings.  In fine, my point is that if you want to hurt them, you're hurting them a lot right now with your newfound power. But don't think for a second that this will result in them going bankrupt or any big consequences for them. This will result, as always, with them making a lot of money (or at the very least recouping their losses) and the retail investors losing all their money.

He said he didn’t set out to draw the attention of Congress, the Federal Reserve, hedge funds, the media, trading platforms and hundreds of thousands of investors.  “This story is so much bigger than me,” Mr. Gill told The Wall Street Journal in his first interview since the unboxing this week of a volatile new stock market game. “I support these retail investors, their ability to make a statement.”  To many of them, Mr. Gill—who until recently worked in marketing for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.—is the force behind the triple-digit gains in shares of the videogame retailer GameStop, up more than 900% this year through Thursday. On Wednesday, the stock jumped 135% to $347.51, a record, before plunging to $194 a share Thursday as online brokerages clamped down. At the start of the year, GameStop shares went for around $18.  Many online investors say his advocacy helped turn them into a force powerful enough to cause big losses for established hedge funds and, for the moment, turn the investing world upside down.  Mr. Gill posted a screenshot of his brokerage account Wednesday, showing a roughly $20 million daily gain on GameStop shares and options. “Your steady hand convinced many of us to not only buy, but hold. Your example has literally changed the lives of thousands of ordinary normal people. Seriously thank you. You deserve every penny,” replied one Reddit user, reality_czech.  The next day, Mr. Gill posted another screenshot—showing about a $15 million loss. After Thursday’s market close, his E*Trade brokerage account, viewed by the Journal, held around $33 million, including GameStop stock, options and millions in cash.  “He always liked money,” said Elaine Gill, his mother. As a child, she said, “he would get money from those scratch tickets that people didn’t know they’d won. People would throw them on the ground…A lot of times there was still money on them.”  Mr. Gill’s online persona—he goes by “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube—has drawn tens of thousands of fans and copycats who share screenshots of their own brokerage accounts. As the GameStop frenzy peaked this week, hundreds of thousands of new investors downloaded applications like Robinhood to join the action, according to Apptopia Inc.  Mr. Gill said he wasn’t a rabble-rouser out to take on the establishment, just someone who believes investors can find value in unloved stocks. He never expected to have a legion of fans debating his identity online, or millions of dollars in his trading account, he said. He was just a dad with an online hobby and a plastic kiddie slide on the front lawn of a Boston suburb.  Mr. Gill began investing in GameStop around June 2019, he said, when it was hovering around $5 a share. Earlier that year, the game retailer was hunting for its fifth chief executive in a little over 12 months. Mr. Gill kept buying. Although he never played much besides Super Mario or Donkey Kong, he saw potential for the struggling retailer to reinvigorate itself by attracting new customers with the latest videogame consoles.  “People were doing a quick take, saying GameStop was the next Blockbuster, ” he said, a chain caught in a retail decline. “It appeared many folks just weren’t digging in deeper. It was a gross misclassification of the opportunity.”  Mr. Gill, tall with shoulder-length hair, opened a YouTube channel last summer, and he worked in the basement of the home he rents in Wilmington, Mass., to avoid disturbing his daughter after bedtime, he said. On his channel, he touted GameStop and Belgian beers. His favorite is Delirium Tremens.  On a recent YouTube live-stream, he wore a red headband and aviator sunglasses while fielding questions on stocks. He poured himself Prosecco then switched to beer as he celebrated big gains and gave shout-outs to legions of viewers and traders in a seven-hour-plus extravaganza. The stream has tallied more than 200,000 views.  Mr. Gill’s obscene username on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum is supposed to reflect a belief in value investing—buying shares of companies that are inexpensive relative to the underlying business.  Among his many Reddit fans, Mr. Gill “will go down as the greatest legend in the history of WallStreetBets,” said Jon Hagedorn, a 34-year-old training supervisor based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. “He’s the original OG.”  The stock’s wild ride, seemingly divorced from standard measures of corporate value, has spurred complaints that investors banding together to provoke this kind of frenzy amounts to market manipulation.  The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it would “act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity.” Mr. Gill said he hasn’t heard from the SEC.  Fast times  “The first thing that I had asked him when this craziness started was: is this illegal or anything dishonest? He said, ‘No mom, it’s not,’” recalled Ms. Gill, who lives in Brockton, Mass., where she and Steve Gill raised their son.  In high school, Mr. Gill was a distance runner, and he earned national honors on the team at nearby Stonehill College, where he graduated in 2009 with an accounting major. He ran a four-minute mile until sidelined by an Achilles injury.  Mr. Gill moved to New Hampshire for a few years and found a mentor, an investor and software developer his aunt introduced him to. He holds a designation as a Chartered Financial Analyst and said he was drawn by the complexity and challenge of stock picking, which became an outlet for the energy he once put into running. He started working at MassMutual in 2019.  In the summer of 2019, he started building his position in GameStop and would post screenshots of his E*Trade account’s options positions on WallStreetBets forum. “Holy s— bro, what made you drop 53K on GameStop?” one trader posted about one of Mr. Gill’s screenshots in September 2019.  In the months that followed, he posted regularly, putting up a “GME YOLO update,” a reference to GameStop’s ticker and the mantra “you only live once.” He showed off gains in the five- and six-digits, and times when his investments plunged.  Mr. Gill stuck with GameStop, and his wagers became day-trader lore.  To fans, he tapped into the desire by millions of amateur investors around the U.S. to try their hand at stock trading. Trading fees have fallen to zero, and apps allow investors to buy and sell on their phones. The easy market access is augmented by an online community swelled with eager helpers.  Many first-time investors stuck at home in the pandemic said they found solace in chatting with others online about trading stocks or options, as well as hearing from those making profitable bets.  The discourse isn’t always positive. An off-Reddit chat room associated with WallStreetBets is filled with obscenity, racism and antigay screeds. Many on the platforms lash out against Wall Street power players, and some express a desire to see the financial pros reel from losses.  “I’m not out for anybody,” Mr. Gill said. “Roaring Kitty was an educational channel where I was showcasing my investment philosophy.”  Bear bust  Many on Wall Street disagreed with Mr. Gill’s bullish view on GameStop and have taken a big hit as a result. Hedge funds and other investment professionals piled into wagers that the shares would tumble.  To bet against a stock, hedge funds borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and return them. That allows them to pocket the difference between the prices. But when a shorted stock stages such a dramatic rally, it turns painful, often forcing them to exit from the positions by purchasing shares at a loss. In turn, that can inspire sharp gains in stocks, known as a “short squeeze.”  The bearish positioning of hedge funds was part of what drew many small GameStop investors, anticipating a short squeeze. Mr. Gill said his investing strategy didn’t entirely depend on a short squeeze, but he knew others were potentially betting on it.  So far, the professionals have been wrong, giving a win to Mr. Gill and other individual investors who bet big on GameStop. Hedge funds like Melvin Capital Management and Maplelane Capital were the ones burned, as well as jeered by boastful Reddit investors.  Many others have piled into GameStop, trying to ride the rally “to the moon,” as many Reddit investors say. Individual investors have also piled into shares of companies like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. in the hopes of catching similar momentum and making a quick buck.  GameStop has garnered hundreds of thousands of posts over the past month across Reddit, Twitter and Facebook, according to data this week from Meltwater, a global media intelligence company. As the stock has vaulted higher, its shares have traded in a frenzy, making it one of the most popular bets in the U.S. market in recent days, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  Seasoned traders are starting to take into account the behavior of influential investors like Mr. Gill and others.  Mark Sebastian, founder of Chicago-based Options Pit and an options trader for around 20 years, has developed a screener analyzing reams of stocks to spot those with heavy activity from individual investors. He buys or sells options based on which stocks are gaining momentum, trying to ride the wave higher or lower. Recently, this included AMC, though he said he wasn’t a fan.  “We’re trying to get on these names before they completely take off,” Mr. Sebastian said, calling one recent trade “free money.”  Mr. Gill said his life has changed overnight and hasn’t set his future plans. He would like to continue the “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel, maybe buy a house. “I thought this trade would be successful,” he said, “but I never expected what happened over the past week.”  He has one dream in mind. “I always wanted to build an indoor track facility or a field house in Brockton,” he said of his hometown. “And now, it looks like I actually could do that.”  —Elisa Cho, Jim Oberman and Caitlin McCabe contributed to this article.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|6055971.0|public|confidence|self|DFV talks to the Wall Street Journal|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7w856/dfv_talks_to_the_wall_street_journal/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-29|EXPR

Decentralized small groups that fight misinformation, inform the public and disrupt their ability to fight us. They can only regulate us through their systems of control and cannot stop us from interacting outside of their spheres.   The reason this is becoming impossible to stop is because it's decentralized - it's the internet. There are no leaders just apes using their brains when they see a good idea. As groups grow too large they lose the ability to coordinate.  Keep the main WSB streets forum strong, but use smaller subreddits to organize collective action. A few ideas to get us started.  1. boycott any companies supporting false narratives or restricting the freedom of markets such as robinhood, cnbc. Use social media to express your opinion.  2. Spread memes(Snake,Banana,Ape is a good one!) and understandable information to your personal network explaining why they should be on our side.  3. Let our voice be heard to the leaders of our government - flood them with legitimate complaints about how this is immoral. Let them know that we the people demand a free and fair market for all.

Do you have 10 minutes to bitch about this to your family? Do you have 10 minutes to stare at the ticker and screech? Then you have 10 god damn minutes to call your reps! Hear me out.  TL;DR Rich boomers mad, market go down. We make different boomers mad, first boomers go to prison. Apes strong together, GME go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.  Very very few people actually ever write letters or make calls to congressmen or representatives, and they DO actually pay attention (if they get many about the same thing.) On top of the fact that it's a great look for these fat boomer cunts to fight against wall street, big money, and corruption, there are FAR more than enough of us to get the the attention of congress in a meaningful way. It's also easy. A call doesn't need to be some deep argument, just ""I'm concerned about X.""  It might sound like a laughable idea to call up a member of congress to complain, but that's exactly why it works so well; most people don't even think to do it. Remember, your reps are boomers who generally don't have their finger on the pulse. Thousands of people letting them know exactly what's making them upset is a GIFT to them, it's a free political strategy that lets them know what their constituents want. Generally, nobody gives a fuck about congresspeople, and just a couple thousand people voicing their opinions is enough to make their panties wet.  And yes, the financial sector obviously has a lot of power in congress, but we really have the upper hand here for three reasons:  1. It looks bad to take wall street's side. It looks REALLY good to fight for the little guy (that's us!) 2. Given how absoultely blatant and absurd the shit happening right now is, all we need is a single congressperson taking a couple hours to say ""hey, this aint right, somebody check this out."" 3. This isn't political. This isn't democrats vs republicans. In today's political climate, that's a fucking beautiful shiny rare gem.   Again, CALLING CONGRESSPEOPLE WORKS. They really DO listen, not because they're great wonderful people, but because what you're telling them is ""free votes if you do this.""  Here's what you should do:  While writing a letter is probably the best, making a call is much easier and still far better than sending an email (emails really will just get ignored most of the time). You have two members of the house (they're more influential, if you don't have much time, just call those two,) and some number of senators depending on your state. You can go online and find their numbers very easily. When you make the call, this is what you should do:  * Be concise. Your goal is just to say ""I'm upset about this,"" not to make an argument. * Be calm and polite. Again, the goal is simply to express the fact that you are a voter concerned about X. * Write down what you want to say beforehand in a couple of super clear sentances, and just say that. * Mention a specific issue (i.e. Robinhood restricting stocks, news claiming they had already covered, or all of these issues.) Just don't say ""I'm mad that they manipulated the market."" Be specific. * Only call once. If some idiot tries to get more attention by calling 20 times, it suddenly turns the whole thing from ""concerned voters"" to ""the hacker known as reddit has performed a DDoS phone call attack on the US congress""  Again, I know that generally the scales tip in favor of wall street. But with shit as big as this, congress can, has, and will suck and fuck the market manipulating cocksuckers who stuck their malformed little weewees in out business."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4747258.0|public|confidence|self|Dear autists, CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72j3t/dear_autists_call_your_representatives/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-28|EXPR

In the last few days, however, an unprecedented situation has arisen: According to press reports, the shares GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Inc., BlackBerry Limited, Nokia Corp., Express Inc. and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. are apparently currently the subject of violent, coordinated shares Price speculation.

We’re proud to have created a platform that has helped everyday people, from all backgrounds, shape their financial futures and invest for the long term.”  These quotes are pulled straight from Robinhood’s website. Clearly, they are blatant lies as Robinhood does not care for the “everyday person,” they do not want the “financial system to work for everyone.” We are the every day people. We are the ones who are building a new financial system that is truly for everyone. The only thing Robinhood is worried about are the hedge funds they sell their order flow too and regulators who have most likely put Robinhood under a microscope.  These quotes should be taken off the Robinhood website. We’ve decided to set our “own terms”, that we will not let short selling hedge funds profit off destroying companies. They can continue to collude amongst themselves, let them continue to push their agendas about $GME, $AMC, etc. They’ll see that the “financial future” involves them getting the short squeezed for all their tendies. Their market manipulation won’t stop us from going to another brokerage and buying whatever companies we want.  You’re telling me that on Robinhood I can trade 1.5x LEVERAGE VOLATILITY ETFS but I can’t buy $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG BECAUSE OF VOLATILITY????   I know much of what I’m saying has already been said and is being said on this subreddit and literally by every other person on this earth with a brain. The only thing I want is for Robinhood to change their website. Take this bullshit off of it; these pretentious, do-good, pat on the back quotes about their brokerage are an absolute joke. So I’m going to keep buying AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG on another brokerage until Robinhood changes their website.

This is free market with a caveat - until it remains in their favour. You're not going to stick it to Wall Street or bankers this way, for as long as they control the supply and distribution of money, they'll bail every single big guy out at our expense, as they always do. It's their money, their rules rigged firmly in their favour.  To inspire lasting change and wrest control from these dinosaur banks and corporations, who've gainfully thrived throughout this crippling pandemic at the expense of the rest of us, we must democratize the supply and distribution of money itself.  Until a decade ago, never in the history of money was this possible, which is why fundamentally flawed fiat money has survived. Not anymore. Now we have scarce, unstoppable, censorship-resistant money founded upon hard-wired mathematics which allows us to take control of the supply and distribution of money and we absolutely must seize this moment to do so.

(2): To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange...creating actual or apparent active trading in such activity, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others...  (6): To effect either alone or with one or more other persons any series of transactions for the purchase and/or sale of any security other than a government security for the purpose of pegging, fixing, or stabilizing the price of such security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate.   Slow your roll, big media- WSB did NOT violate these rules, even by the logic that platforms like Robinhood are clearly doing it right now. Take $GME, for example (which is on its way to $2500 btw). Media would like to believe we inflated the price of the security beyond a reasonable explanation and as such are guilty of market manipulation. But it’s a *market*, it’s worth whatever the majority say it is. And clearly we all love the stock, so you tell me- did we lie to the media or the SEC when we placed the orders at the price points we were publicly posting about moving towards?   No! The reality is, there isn’t a shred of legal basis to the claim that this sub “manipulated” anything, and in truth so long as it is not possible for a lone redditor to convince the world a security is worth more than it is, it is not possible to call the collective agreement on a stock by a publicly speaking body “manipulation”. By that standard, all of StockTwits would have to be tried. There are simply so many ways that indemnify this subs content from charges- people are allowed to express and hold any position about any security regardless of whether or not there’s 4.20 million other degenerates with the same brilliant idea.  Robinhood on the other hand has blatantly (and strategically) obfuscated securities data and restricted investor rights in a poor attempt to control the volatility and interest in specific securities. And yes, a class-action is absolutely in order!   Fuck the news, fuck Robinhood, fuck Melvin, fuck it all. Time for them to learn!!

Preliminary data from that study shows that Tempol decreases cytokines from stimulated cells from COVID-19 patients. The collaboration expects to submit the final data to a peer reviewed journal.**  **Tempol has previously demonstrated both potent anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and antioxidant activity. Both inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from cells of the immune system called macrophages and neutrophils damage the lung in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In animal models, Tempol has been shown to decrease proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), and through its potent antioxidant activity has been shown to decrease the harmful effects of ROS. In addition, Tempol has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation, a problem observed in many COVID-19 patients. Numerous published articles describing animal models of ARDS show Tempol to cause a decrease in lung inflammation and preserve lung pathology associated with acute and chronic lung injury. To this end, Tempol has been shown to decrease the genes (HIF-la and HIF-2a) associated with hypoxia. Hypoxia is a key indicator often associated with severe disease and a poor outcome. Controlling hypoxia and the cytokine storm can be considered essential to the successful treatment of COVID-19.   Tempol could potentially be used to treat the many manifestations of COVID-19 and prevent severe disease as well as the need for hospitalization.**  **Dr.** **Dennis J. Carlo, President and CEO of Adamis commented: “We are very excited about the collaboration with** **Stanford University. This is the first data that we know of that shows Tempol has a positive impact in decreasing cytokine production from COVID-19 positive patient cells. These data further support the need for clinical studies of Tempol in COVID-19 patients. We intend to continue pursuing government and/or non-government funding for these studies; however, the recent exercise of outstanding warrants have provided the company with additional capital which may be used to help support and/or accelerate Tempol clinical studies.”**  **About Adamis Pharmaceuticals**  **Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on developing and commercializing products in various therapeutic areas, including allergy, respiratory and inflammatory disease.  The company’s SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection products are approved by the FDA for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Adamis’ naloxone injection product candidate, ZIMHI, for the treatment of opioid overdose is currently under FDA review.  Adamis is developing additional products, including treatments for acute respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19, influenza, asthma and COPD.  The company’s subsidiary, U.S. Compounding, Inc., compounds sterile prescription drugs, and certain nonsterile drugs for human and veterinary use by hospitals, clinics, surgery centers, and vet clinics throughout most of the** **United States.**  **Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The wives were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of boyfriends danced in their heads,  And Dr. Patel on his Twitter, And Chamath on the news, Holding positions and anticipating the cruise,  When out on Wall Street there arose such a ruckus, We only held stronger, to keep them from fucking us,  Away from the earth, we will fly with a flash, Now up through the clouds, dreaming of cash.  The stars on the horizon beaming with glow, Gave the luster of the tendies we began with below,  When, what to my wondering eyes should the enemy appear, But many-a-short-sellers grinning ear to ear.  With their cocky positions, so crooked and wrong, I knew in that moment it must be Citron,  More 🌈 than a bear, just like 2008, They’ve come once again, here to manipulate,  With broadcasts and articles, screeching of fraud, They called for our takedown, but alas they were flawed.  “Now NIO! Now NOK! Now TSLA and AMC! On PLTR, On BBBY, On EXPR and BB!  To the top of the charts! To the top of my screen! There’s only way to go! Green! Green! Green!”  For now, we must be patient, But my fellow retards, I’ll leave you with this,  Tis not for the gains, nor for fame, But for those whom we will help in our Hero’s name,  Look at those short sellers and who they thought they could mock, Now all they hear is “we like the stock”,  It is time, remain steadfast on our journey ahead, There is little to fear, when there is no sight of red,  The stories will be legendary, of the downfall of our enemy,  And for that to thank, we have **GME**🚀  \-LBC|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4613562.0|public|confidence|self|'Twas the Night Before Takeoff🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yvxu/twas_the_night_before_takeoff/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-28|EXPR

In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.  Amid significant market volatility, it’s important as ever that we help customers stay informed. That’s why we’re committed to providing people with educational resources. We recently[ revamped and expanded](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/15/robinhood-learnthe-building-blocks-of-your-financial-journey) Robinhood[ Learn](https://learn.robinhood.com/) to help people take advantage of the hundreds of financial resources we offer and educate themselves, including how to[ make sense of a volatile market](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/the-stock-market-has-been-super-volatile-how-can-i-make-sense-of-it/). In 2020, more than 3.2 million people read our articles through Robinhood Learn.  We’re committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty. We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets. We’re humbled to have helped many people invest in the markets for the first time. And we’re determined to provide new and experienced investors with the tools and resources to help them invest responsibly for their long-term financial futures.

The first one that sticks out to me is the long-form podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. You can go on this platform and speak for 3 hours with a guy that just wants to know where you're coming from and isn't trying to push a specific agenda or narrative. This reaches an audience in the tens of millions of people with a wide variety of beliefs, ideas, and opinions.

As all you retards can see, today NOK went up 40% and is expected to continue this way for the next couple weeks. Im fuckin sure you have no idea why.. so this is why:  1-Call with a maturity of February 19 has having the greates volume of trading comparing to any other dates available. Also, Short sellers contracts will expired at this date.   2-The short float is 65%, which is quite high comparing with the 45% of AMC… just fuckin imagine, AMC went 250% up today! Which means that NOK could hit 325% up easily before 2/12!  3-NOK calls are 10 times cheaper than AMC and GME, which means that more fuckin bastards could get inside this shit.. which mean more liquidity, more demand, so the PRICE WILL GO UP.  From all the different options to get rich rn (AMC, NOK, BB, GME, EXPR, etc), NOK is the one that has been undervalued by wsb gang… this is THE CHEAPEST, FASTER and THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

So far, the following have worked out quite well (in order):  1. AMC  - Bought at around $5 (currently at around 17) 2. NOK - Also bought at around $5 (currently at around 7.5) 3. HIBB - Bought at 53 (currently at around 55.5) 4. BB - Bought at \~20 (Currently at 27) 5. NAKD: Bought at \~0.6 (currently at around 0.9) 6. EXPR: Bought at \~6 (currently at 10)  **Just bought 5000 SNDL stocks at 60 cents,** just based on a random unverified tweet that said it's among the top traded stocks today. Cheap stock, given the past trends, I don't think there's too much downside. Who knows if it gets pulled into the current trend and goes to double digits. Every dollar gained will mean $5K profit (I am not a seasoned investor, so just random logics)  Other longer term bets: Twtr, GM, Uber (currently losing), Salesforce (bought at 220), CPLP, Zoom, SCU  I do believe Nokia and BB can bounce back as businesses too, the rest I've invested mostly based on the chatter. AMC turned out to be a good decision. High hopes on NAKD and EXPR because I've bought a decent amount (by my own standards).  Any other stocks would you recommend, or any of the above you'd recommend exiting?

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading for GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC), as well as other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.  ""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies.  ""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" she said.  Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but is still operating as an independent retail brokerage platform, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those trading names, including GameStop.  A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, or how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.""  The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathered in online chat forums to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.  Traders on sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms like Robinhood, have clashed with hedge- fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop shares.  A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the popular trading platform ""continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.""  Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for GME and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn't allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.  However, the recent run-up in GameStop has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with shares of companies like AMC Entertainment also surging in price on Wednesday, along with shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)and retailer Express Inc.

I'm relatively new to investing, but browsing forums, reading charts, and doing (somewhat amateur) DD, I think I have a list of some good investments that can be held for a year or longer. I'm not posting a full DD for each company, just some points I find interesting, mostly the values and projections for each. For disclosure's sake, I am NOT currently invested in any of these companies except for MRNA and RVP.   FLGT:  If hearing ""sales growth of 880%"" doesn't perk up your ears I don't know what will, the last 12 months have been booming for Fulgent Genetics. They have exceeded analysts projected earnings estimates by 501% and 277% the last two quarters. This fella is undervalued with those numbers, even with the stock price up 60% in January alone. Currently going for about $83 but valued around $140. If you buy now you would be buying at the top, but it's still projected to go higher.  MRNA:  This is one of the two stocks on this list that I am currently invested in (approx 9% of my portfolio). While not \*quite\* as impressive as FLGT's 880% sales growth, Moderna's 826% sales growth over the last year is still fantastic. One of the most undervalued stocks on this list with the current price only about 53% of it's current value, Moderna has a lot of potential. MRNA is up 55% already in 2021. Moderna reported only $60 million in sales in 2019, but are projected to have between 1.5 to 15 billion in 2021. That's a huge window, but even if they hit the lowest projection it will be fantastic for the company. Again, you would be buying high if you went in now, but it looks like right now is the lowest it will be for the foreseeable future.  NVAX:  This company fascinates me the most on this list. The current price is less than half of the current value. Phenomenal upside potential, with unreal sales growth in the last 12 months at 999%. Novavax stock has rocketed 1302% in the last year. Reported 2019 sales of 18.7 million with 2021 sales projections ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 billion. While 999% sales growth was impressive, the projected annual sales growth is an astounding 2,815%. I almost wonder if this one is too good to be true, which is why I haven't invested yet, but I am beyond tempted.  HZO:  Up 34% this month. Reported earnings the last two quarters exceeded analyst projections by 120% and 177%. Undervalued with excellent sales growth. The current quarter looks like it might be mediocre for MarineMax, but the year-long forecasts look great. Undervalued by about 33%, the potential upside for MarineMax is solid.   DQ:  Daqo New Energy's stock has been exploding, up 910% in the past year. It's slightly undervalued, currently selling for around $100 but valued closer to $118. They have had sales growth of 51% over the last year with projected rates going much, much higher. One to keep an eye on.  MKSI:  MKS Instruments is the first stock listed that offers a dividend. At $0.80 annually per share with a dividend growth of 10%, it's a nice cherry on top to what looks like a good investment. Up 13% this year, MKSI has a median projected growth of 17% for the next 12 months. Their earnings exceeded projections all of the last four quarters each between 8% and 36%. MKSI has been in a dip the last week, down about 10%. If you're thinking about buying, now would be a good time.  RVP:  The second stock I am invested in on this list (approx 16% of my portfolio), Retractable Technologies stock is up 50% in January. I see an earnings growth rate around 40% after they had 133% sales growth over the last 12 months. Like all these other picks, RVP is undervalued, presently going for $16 with a current value closer to $26.   LRCX:  Up 12% this month, Lam Research doesn't have numbers quite as sexy as the others on this list but it's worth looking at. Earnings exceeded forecasts by 9% and 17% the last two quarters. Undervalued by about $170, I see LRCX having plenty of room to grow, especially with their earnings projected to grow by 45%.   WILD CARD: PLTR  Palantir Tech isn't really a wild card, but it breaks from the rest of the list by being massively OVERvalued at $38, when the current value is much closer to $3. It's up 61% in January, but 12 months projections look grim, with even the best outlooks predicting a 20% decrease in stock price. The reason I put it on this list is because I do think it will grow years from now, mostly from what happened earlier this week. Lots of people, especially software developers, were amazed with Palantir's Gotham presentation, many of them saying it could be a major player in the future. I think the stock price will definitely decline, which is why I'm not buying in now, but it will be worth revisiting when it drops.   Like I said, very amateur DD done for these guys, primarily looking at past and projected sales and stock price vs value, with some consideration given to price volatility, price decline resistance, dividends, and timing price trends.

I'm relatively new to investing, but browsing forums, reading charts, and doing (somewhat amateur) DD, I think I have a list of some good investments that can be held for a year or longer. I'm not posting a full DD for each company, just some points I find interesting, mostly the values and projections for each. For disclosure's sake, I am NOT currently invested in any of these companies except for MRNA and RVP.   FLGT:  If hearing ""sales growth of 880%"" doesn't perk up your ears I don't know what will, the last 12 months have been booming for Fulgent Genetics. They have exceeded analysts projected earnings estimates by 501% and 277% the last two quarters. This fella is undervalued with those numbers, even with the stock price up 60% in January alone. Currently going for about $83 but valued around $140. If you buy now you would be buying at the top, but it's still projected to go higher.  MRNA:  This is one of the two stocks on this list that I am currently invested in (approx 9% of my portfolio). While not \*quite\* as impressive as FLGT's 880% sales growth, Moderna's 826% sales growth over the last year is still fantastic. One of the most undervalued stocks on this list with the current price only about 53% of it's current value, Moderna has a lot of potential. MRNA is up 55% already in 2021. Moderna reported only $60 million in sales in 2019, but are projected to have between 1.5 to 15 billion in 2021. That's a huge window, but even if they hit the lowest projection it will be fantastic for the company. Again, you would be buying high if you went in now, but it looks like right now is the lowest it will be for the foreseeable future.  NVAX:  This company fascinates me the most on this list. The current price is less than half of the current value. Phenomenal upside potential, with unreal sales growth in the last 12 months at 999%. Novavax stock has rocketed 1302% in the last year. Reported 2019 sales of 18.7 million with 2021 sales projections ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 billion. While 999% sales growth was impressive, the projected annual sales growth is an astounding 2,815%. I almost wonder if this one is too good to be true, which is why I haven't invested yet, but I am beyond tempted.  HZO:  Up 34% this month. Reported earnings the last two quarters exceeded analyst projections by 120% and 177%. Undervalued with excellent sales growth. The current quarter looks like it might be mediocre for MarineMax, but the year-long forecasts look great. Undervalued by about 33%, the potential upside for MarineMax is solid.   DQ:  Daqo New Energy's stock has been exploding, up 910% in the past year. It's slightly undervalued, currently selling for around $100 but valued closer to $118. They have had sales growth of 51% over the last year with projected rates going much, much higher. One to keep an eye on.  MKSI:  MKS Instruments is the first stock listed that offers a dividend. At $0.80 annually per share with a dividend growth of 10%, it's a nice cherry on top to what looks like a good investment. Up 13% this year, MKSI has a median projected growth of 17% for the next 12 months. Their earnings exceeded projections all of the last four quarters each between 8% and 36%. MKSI has been in a dip the last week, down about 10%. If you're thinking about buying, now would be a good time.  RVP:  The second stock I am invested in on this list (approx 16% of my portfolio), Retractable Technologies stock is up 50% in January. I see an earnings growth rate around 40% after they had 133% sales growth over the last 12 months. Like all these other picks, RVP is undervalued, presently going for $16 with a current value closer to $26.   LRCX:  Up 12% this month, Lam Research doesn't have numbers quite as sexy as the others on this list but it's worth looking at. Earnings exceeded forecasts by 9% and 17% the last two quarters. Undervalued by about $170, I see LRCX having plenty of room to grow, especially with their earnings projected to grow by 45%.   WILD CARD: PLTR  Palantir Tech isn't really a wild card, but it breaks from the rest of the list by being massively OVERvalued at $38, when the current value is much closer to $3. It's up 61% in January, but 12 months projections look grim, with even the best outlooks predicting a 20% decrease in stock price.

I’m writing you concerning the latest news regarding certain stocks (GameStop, AMC, Blackberry, Express, etc) and the groundswell movement from millions of everyday Americans that is driving these prices up. They are buying stocks they believe in. Make no mistake, they are heroes despite how the ""professional investor"" tries to position this situation in the media.  The villain(s) in this situation is the Hedge Funds that systematically “short” stocks. Here’s how it works, and why THEY are the problem: They take their client’s stocks and sell them (often without their customer’s knowledge). They then put out publicity and “opinion pieces” about how that company / stock is horrible and not worth the price. They are bashing fellow Americans and the American Companies they work for. They do this to intentionally influence the market and drive the prices down. When these stock prices go down, they then buy the stocks back at the lower price, put them back into their customer’s accounts (again, without their customer’s knowledge) and pocket the difference. The customer’s account value is now lower because that stock price / value is lower.  They have just stolen from their customers and the American People. THIS is what we need you and our Government to investigate.   You must take a position. You can take the side of the everyday Americans that believe in these American Companies and the American Workers that these stocks represent. Or, you will be on the side of those trashing and belittling these American Companies and American Workers."|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2904155.0|public|confidence|self|Letter to my Representatives in Congress supporting WSB|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66q8w/letter_to_my_representatives_in_congress/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-27|EXPR

I've rolled my entire stimmy check from a 💩 money fund to EXPR call options. EXPR is gonna be the next GME. It's the EXACT same setup. Let's go through the DD, not that you retards can even read:  1. Active hedge fund involvement / balance sheet restoration - Sycamore Partners owns a substantial % of the float and just gave EXPR a new financing round together with Wells Fargo. This is critical because their low cash to near-term liabilities ratio is a big part of why they've been a 💩 penny stock. That's fixed now. Fundamentally, they're well positioned. Latest 10-Q shows that their speed to market on new clothing lines has improved dramatically, which will be a huge factor as their retail stores come back after being shut down. 2. Takeout potential - Even after today's 100% gain, EXPR is still only a 250M stock. That's literally peanuts for some of these funds. Sycamore Partners is the same hedge fund that tried to acquire EXPR in 2015, but couldn't get the right terms at the time. They will absolutely try again before EXPR gets too expensive. 3. Gamma squeeze - short interest is now 12% of float. That is where GME was just 2 months ago. It's still early innings here but 12% makes it one of the top 50 most shorted stocks. No one wants to be short a 250M market cap stock in this meme economy. One more up day and this thing is taking off.  PT $60, or $4B market cap. 💎✋ all the way.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img r5v5ceokemd61...*|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2272205.0|public|confidence|self|EXPR is gonna 🚀🚀🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l580pa/expr_is_gonna/|some_ads|7.0|||{'r5v5ceokemd61': {'status': 'failed'}}||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-26|EXPR

GameStop stock equal to 139% of its available shares has been borrowed and sold short, a bearish position showing mark-to-market losses of over $6 billion year-to-date, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. That figure is little changed since last Thursday’s 141% short-interest reading, even though GameStop shares have surged roughly 130% in the past two days alone.  The still-high level of bearishness indicates that even though shorts are being squeezed out of their positions, new traders looking to bet against GameStop are rushing in, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics. That’s occurring even as the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short spikes -- the stock borrow fee is currently 23.6%, S3 data show.  “We are seeing a short-squeeze on older shorts who have incurred massive mark-to-market losses on their positions, but are seeing new shorts coming in and using any stock borrows that become available to initiate new short positions in hopes of an eventual pullback from this stratospheric stock price move,” Dusaniwsky wrote in an email.  GameStop shares have surged 437% since activist investor Ryan Cohen and two allies and fellow Chewy Inc. alumni gained seats on the video-game retailer’s board. The news was an inflection point and lit the fuse for retail investors betting the company could undergo a complete digital transformation.  The stock’s surge was in part fueled by an army of Reddit-charged day traders who used the website’s WallStreetBets forum to pump up shares and fight back against the eye-popping levels of short interest. Bets by Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital and Andrew Left’s Citron Research have faced a reckoning in the battle with GameStop’s retail fans.  Left, who decided on Friday to no longer discuss the company, faced backlash from vocal Reddit users over his critiques of the company on Twitter and in a YouTube video. The noted short-seller referred to actions from “an angry mob” which responded to his argument for shares to “go back to $20” when he said he’d go dark on the stock.  Still, even with Citron standing down, the mania has only gained momentum -- and spread to other stocks. GameStop soared as much as 145% on Monday, before briefly dipping to a loss and then gaining 14% by 12:45 p.m. Express Inc., who some on Reddit have speculated will be the next GameStop, rocketed by as much as 123%. Meanwhile, BlackBerry Ltd. climbed as much as 48% after more than doubling in 2021.  That’s piled on punishment for short-sellers, who were already smarting. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of the most heavily shorted stocks rose as much as 11% in New York Monday. That brought its month-to-date return above 38%, the most since at least 2008, as far back as data for the index goes.  “What that does is it makes it much harder to run a short book, because the companies with the weaker fundamentals are not realizing those fundamentals the way they used to,” Stuart Kaiser, head of derivatives research at UBS Group AG, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday. “If you’re short a stock right now, you’re really running serious risk to your portfolio to be in those stocks.”  But action in the options market suggests the tide may eventually turn, according to Susquehanna International Group. The pace of bearish put-contract buying outpaced that of call purchases on Monday, with roughly 500,000 puts purchases versus 275,000 calls. That follows a similar dynamic on Friday, after six consecutive weeks of call volume clocking in higher than put buying.  “The GME rally is unlikely to last forever, and investors looking for a sign we are closer to the end could look at the 6 week streak of call volume outpacing put volume finally being broken,” wrote Susquehanna co-head of derivatives strategy Chris Murphy in a note Monday.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2258867.0|public|confidence|self|Shorts Loss is 6 Billion YTD!!!!|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l56cdj/shorts_loss_is_6_billion_ytd/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-26|EXPR

GameStop stock equal to 139% of its available shares has been borrowed and sold short, a bearish position showing mark-to-market losses of over $6 billion year-to-date, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

Looking at PetMed Express.  PetMed Express has been around since 1996 and is America's largest full service pet pharmacy, marketing the most popular prescription and non-prescription medications to dogs, cats and horses directly to the consumer. They are licensed to sell in all 50 states and have net revenue of $285million.   &amp;#x200B;  Their vision: Trusted, Fast and Easy, Best in Service. How do they deliver? Typically consumers save money buying through them as opposed to the veterinarian.

GameStop stock equal to 139% of its available shares has been borrowed and sold short, a bearish position showing mark-to-market losses of over $6 billion year-to-date, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. That figure is little changed since last Thursday’s 141% short-interestreading, even though GameStop shares have surged roughly 78% in the past two days alone. The still-high level of bearishness indicates that even though shorts are being squeezed out of their positions, new traders looking to bet against GameStop are rushing in, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics. That’s occurring even as the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short spikes -- the stock borrow fee is currently 23.6%, S3 data show.  Read More: Matt Levine’s Money Stuff: The Game Never Stops  “We are seeing a short-squeeze on older shorts who have incurred massive mark-to-market losses on their positions, but are seeing new shorts coming in and using any stock borrows that become available to initiate new short positions in hopes of an eventual pullback from this stratospheric stock price move,”  Dusaniwsky wrote in an email. GameStop shares have surged 285% since activist investor Ryan Cohen and two allies and fellow Chewy Inc. alumni gained seats on the video-game retailer’s board. The news was an inflection point and lit the fuse for retail investors betting the company could undergo a complete digital transformation. Read more: GameStop’s Surge Gives Chewy Co-Founder Cohen a 1,200% Gain The stock’s surge was in part fueled by an army of Reddit-charged day traders who used the website’s WallStreetBets forum to pump up shares and fight back against the eye-popping levels of short interest. Bets by Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital and Andrew Left’s Citron Research have faced a reckoning in the battle with GameStop’s retail fans. Left, who decided on Friday to no longer discuss the company, faced backlash from vocal Reddit users over his critiques of the company on Twitter and in a YouTube video. The noted short-seller referred to actions from “an angry mob” which responded to his argument for shares to “go back to $20” when he said he’d go dark on the stock.Still, even with Citron standing down, the mania has only gained momentum -- and spread to other stocks. GameStop closed up 18% after soaring as much as 145% on Monday and then briefly dipping to a loss. Express Inc., who some on Reddit have speculated will be the next GameStop, jumped 132%. Meanwhile, BlackBerry Ltd. climbed 28% after more than doubling in 2021. That’s piled on punishment for short-sellers, who were already smarting. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of the most heavily shorted stocks rose as much as 4.5% in New York Monday. That brought its month-to-date return above 30%, the most since at least 2008, as far back as data for the index goes. “What that does is it makes it much harder to run a short book, because the companies with the weaker fundamentals are not realizing those fundamentals the way they used to,” Stuart Kaiser, head of derivatives research at UBS Group AG, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday. “If you’re short a stock right now, you’re really running serious risk to your portfolio to be in those stocks.”  Another Round  In the eyes of S3 founder Bob Sloan thinks there’s more pain to come for the short-sellers still targeting GameStop. “Get prepared for another round of short squeeze,” Sloane said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday. “You are going to see GameStop go way higher.” He added that the people who originally shorted the stock have been “taken out” only to be replaced by new investors who are going to short it again. But action in the options market suggests the tide may eventually turn, according to Susquehanna International Group. The pace of bearish put-contract buying outpaced that of call purchases on Monday, with roughly 500,000 puts purchases versus 275,000 calls. That follows a similar dynamic on Friday, after six consecutive weeks of call volume clocking in higher than put buying. “The GME rally is unlikely to last forever, and investors looking for a sign we are closer to the end could look at the 6 week streak of call volume outpacing put volume finally being broken,” wrote Susquehanna co-head of derivatives strategy Chris Murphy in a note Monday.     |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2195388.0|public|confidence|self|BLOOMBERG HAD THIS TO SAY.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4z2tk/bloomberg_had_this_to_say/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-25|EXPR

Now they are ganging up on them.** Who is left to buy when the buyer at the margin is something that’s just trying to torture a short seller? This is incredibly unhealthy. **There will be hell to pay for what you are seeing on your screen right now,”** Smead says.  &gt;But the traders have piled into the name this month amid a boardroom shakeup and the arrival of Chewy founder Ryan Cohen as a 13% shareholder in the company. The developments have been interpreted by traders as transformational for GameStop, and they have jumped into the heavily shorted stock hand over fist. Momentum has beget momentum in the market for GameStop shares. Where it stops is unclear.  &gt;Now the crowd of short sellers have set their sights on similar stories. Express — a dying mall-based apparel retailer —saw its stock surge more than 100% totally out of the blue at one point today. Similar to GameStop, the gang of short sellers appears to be taking their cue from favorable news earlier this month. Express secured $140 million in additional funding to help it ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.  &gt;However, Express and GameStop remain markedly weak companies from a fundamental perspective. **Neither company warrants to be worth 50% or more versus last Friday’s close, especially as there has been no fresh news in weeks.**  &gt;**The same could be said for BlackBerry, the newest well-shorted stock to be tossed into the speculative buying mania.** Shares rose 31% in Monday’s session, on no new news. The gas for BlackBerry’s sizzling rise looks to be it selling 90 patents to Huawei, but that happened several weeks ago.   &gt;While BlackBerry arguably has the best business model among GameStop and Express amid a push into auto technology for infotainment systems, **it’s hard to justify the company being worth 30% more versus Friday’s close. Warns Smead, “The abuse for this stuff is going to cause a whole generation of people to not want to participate in the stock, which is exactly what happens every 30 years.

I haven’t seen anything like it.  Last week was exhausting (and I was mainly just watching...)  No doubt people are drained from stress, flying, falling, fear, ecstasy. This is especially true if you’ve partaken in drugs, alcohol, sex. No judgement, I just want you to do your laundry after the ecstasy to prepare for whatever is to come. Blood or angels.   Many no doubt have wins and losses, and there is a huge amount of depletion that occurs inside of the brain and body after serious events. People need to refuel. It will help sharpen you for the coming week.   Tips:  *Go for a walk/stroll outside. Smell anything out there.  *Eat a balanced diet today. Load up on veggies and fruits. Drink a lot of water. A lot. *Take a cold shower. *Express and feel gratitude, starting with basic things like the fact you have eyes and can see. Try for 3 things, even if you are down.  *Search your maps for a float therapy (“isolation tank”, “floating”, “sensory deprivation”). This usually costs $70 and is a pinnacle experience. Trust me. I’ve been floating for years and you bet your ass I went today. *If you can’t do the above, meditate. *Read a book *Draw  **TL;DR** I want you to be the best you this coming week so that you survive, because the market has no barriers. It has no boundaries. You need to have a fresh mind and body to take on the volatility and pure Gs of a rocket ship. It is abso-fucking-lutely terrifying for some people. Whatever plays you’re making, please go into the coming week with a clear mind. I especially recommend floating in a sensory deprivation tank.   Share your ideas in the comments, and when inspired, go do that thing. Please.

I cannot express how proud I am of being one of you. This sets us apart from all those greedy ""maximizing shareholder value"" shitheads and keep us grounded. Which is a power in itself to navigate the world correctly.  GME is a rocketship and odds are on our side with short interest still being high and many of us still buying everyday. Which in turn is getting more people on board (like the thread from hedge fund guy)  Still one negative aspect remains against us in GME and i.e. the debt they have on their books. Around a billion or so dollars.   Why that's a concern? Because GME will come under increased pressure to issue stock if the price continue to rise and the story they will be told is by doing that they can be \*\*debt free\*\*.   \*\*More GME supply is bad for us\*\*  We should think like strategists and come up with novel and previously not thought of ways to get GME debt free. This should be a priority for us. And it is doable. I will lay down some ideas but hoping others on the forum add theirs' too. And then we trust on power of the internet to see those ideas come to light   1. Buy goods/subscriptions from local online GameStop (this one is obvious) 2. Reach out to RC by power of the internet and have him open some kind of a GME fund where we can throw in money (no idea is bad idea) 3. Have someone from the community make connection with RC and ask him what we can do 4. Have GME issue $500-$1000 lifetime membership that will make games at their upcoming renovated stores free to play forever and other similar perks (my favorite so far)  Please add your own and you would be surprised by the power this community holds if we act correctly for a cause."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1995796.0|public|confidence|self|PSA: There's only one possible way to lose on GME and we can fix it!|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l39hrc/psa_theres_only_one_possible_way_to_lose_on_gme/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-23|EXPR

CRSR and its main competitor Logitech (LOGI)...  **Now let's step into the ring with LOGI and CRSR**  ($LOGI)  Net Revenue: +73%  Gross Profit: +108%  Operating Income: +18%  Net Income: +276%  ($CRSR)  Corsair Net Revenue: +60.7%  Gross Profit: +112.4%  Operating Income: +353.6%  Net Income: +2293.5%  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously, Corsair is expanding like a fucking madman and will continue to do so this year. They are stacking up very well against LOGI numbers-wise.  The fun doesn't stop there... ""\[Corsair\] commands over 18 percent of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42 percent of gaming PC components.""  Logitech has a current price of $104 and a market cap of $17.2B Corsair has a current price of $38 and a market cap of $5.35B  **CORSAIR IS LIKE 2/5 THE PRICE OF LOGI BUT IS EXPANDING QUICKER, ACQUIRING MORE COMPANIES, AND HAS AWAY MORE LOYAL FOLLOWING**  ## What differentiates them from the competition?  1. **Quality:** Anyone who buys a corsair product will instantly realize the superior build quality and feel. Somewhat like Apple products, Corsair products are ascetically pleasing, last for ages, and offer many creature comforts. 2. **Name Brand:** If you look at any PC forum that recommends what parts to buy Corsairs’ name will always be popping up. Experienced gamers know what Corsair offers and superior build quality. Most of the time one-off Chinese brands that also sell PC peripherals are not named; People recommend Corsair instead. Almost all of the commentators on this Reddit post swear by Corsair's product line. This is not just a one-time occurrence, it can be seen regularly; Enthusiasts recommending Corsair due to their amazing products. 3. **United Product Front:** Unlike a lot of their competitors, like Logitech or Razer, Corsair has a diverse product lineup for inside and outside of gamers’ PCs. Almost all of these product lighting can be controlled by Corsair's proprietary lighting software. Lighting sounds very stupid, I know, but gamers love it as it makes their PC look cool. With iCue all of the owner’s Corsair products can be controlled from a single interface. This encourages people to stay in the Corsair ecosystem once they purchase their first Corsair product. Everything just works together perfectly.  To sum up, they shit on their competitors for their better execution.  **Their products:**  Computer RAM (light up)  CPU air and water coolers (light up) Keyboards (light up)  Mice (light up)  Headsets (light up)  Mouse Pads (light up)  Computer power supplies (light up)  Headset stands (light up) RGB strips (light up)  PC Cases (light up)  PC Case fans (you guessed it, light up)  **If a consumer can buy all of their peripherals from one company and have them work harmonically together, why not?**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/gijwx5s08yc61.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec86dacc0bb4229eb005ca3ab9713ef1fec86b  &amp;#x200B;  ## But consoles are becoming more and more popular…right?  Yes - and Corsair is covered. They own “Scuff Gaming” which is “a global innovator and creator of high-performance gaming controllers, providing superior accessories and customized gaming controllers for console and PC that are used by top professional gamers as well as casual gamers”  Scuff has cornered the 3rd party controller market. When someone has a non Xbox or PS4 brand controller they ask, “Is that a scuff?” Scuff is the only real name brand company that makes comfortable and quality 3rd party controllers. Unlike Corsair there is much less high level competition in this space. Also almost all competitive console players use a scuff controller due to the superior button layout and customizability.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/91fonxmq7yc61.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef39e5a08918c9c38ebf3048241f4fdbd8a61c7  ## I see a lot more people streaming on youtube and twitch now…Is there money to be made?  Yes! Corsair also owns Elgato which creates necessities for streamers. Elgato does not only offer necessities for steamers but also for YouTubers, filmmakers, and hobbyists. They offer a wide variety of products to produce high-quality videos. Again like Corsair, Elgato is one of the best, if not the best, at what it does in its industry.  ## But who wants to build their own PC when I can just build a prebuilt?  I think you know what I am going to say. Corsair offers this through their subsidiary Origin PCs. Origin offers some great value for money prebuilt PCs because they can secure exclusive deals with Corsair as it is its parent company. I am not going to sugarcoat this, but Origin does have ALOT of competition in this space but I think it is good that Corsair has exposure. I know multiple people who really like their Origin PCs but I know just as many who own other prebuilt that get the job done.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **Your whole setup could be Corsair…**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/js7wto5s7yc61.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be497c21bdef1b9292840378107f03aff9dd73b  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR: CRSR** 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀  They shit on their competition, that plain and simple  &amp;#x200B;  **So how am I playing all of this?**  **SHARES SHARES SHARES (for their next ER which is expected around Febuary 10th but has not been confirmed yet).**  There will probably be a runup if the hype is there so calls could be good to capture that IV runup but I am sticking to shares so I have less risk holding through ER.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  *Disclamer* None of the content published on this site constitutes a recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person.

Historic in scale I think, one of the largest ever to hit a small cap stock.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀    Completely not to my surprise, BB has exactly the same thing going on, with insane open interest, and you guys appear to have done it again today with BB.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀    I went and examined BB, in which I have absolutely no position and haven't the faintest clue what is up with it other than it's some sort of fruit  🍇  and space exploration company🚀 that also makes star trek style tricorders  [📲](https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone-with-rightwards-arrow-at-left/) , which all sounds pretty cool actually, so I should probably be long.  BB has a float or 508m shares. Here's the current gamma chart of the stock:  [https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9](https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9)  For those of you who haven't been paying attention, or are unable to form new memories for medical or genetic reasons, gamma squeeze is when the price moves quickly over various option strikes, causing dealers to buy a ton of stock (if price up) or sell a ton of stock (if price down) so as to not be underwater on the options they sold you guys. In other words, a stock with a TON of options bought by WSB will tend to move a lot faster in price around those option strikes.  Looking at this gamma chart, and those are in hundred thousand contracts btw, you can see why today went crazy. Today, BB, in going from $10.15 a share or wahtever to 12.51 a share, forced dealers to buy about 70 or 80m shares.... on a 508m float... which means they were 2/3 of the trading today. Not really surprising to buy 20% of the float on dealer action (plus whatever you guys were buying) and see a 25% move up. I'm a little surprised it wasn't more tbh, so there are probably some covered calls held by dealers in there, and those people are hating life right now.  The problem is though that you guys hit the end of the gamma ramp. That's why the stock slowed down after 12.5 - you can see it in the gamma chart. No gamma lift means no more forced dealer buying. The good news is there is another gamma ramp at 15, so if you get it up to like 14.5, it'll ramp real easily to 15.5 But after that, no ramp.  In terms of short-term trading dynamics, there are some options expiring this week - about 35 thousand contracts of calls. These will cause a VERY slight melt-up (maybe half a percent tops) as the week goes on, then when dumped or monetized Friday, will cause selling of 3.5m shares of selling, which isn't really a huge deal, and should have marginal effects on price, like half a percent at most down. Most of this open interest is much longer dated, mostly out a year or more.   Why does all of this matter? well:  1) It's going to be harder for the price to go up from here without new gamma established, or a lot more buying. Dealers did heavy lifting for you today with that 70 or 80 million share purchase (would have been more if shorted dated, but it wasn't). That's not happening again until 15, and at 15, it's still only maybe 25m shares in reality, not 70 or 80m, so you'd expect a smaller acceleration there.  2) If people monetize their calls, it's going to hurt, as dealers dump to de-hedge, and there's a gamma ramp down as you can see.  3) And of course, the stock is vulnerable to a push down since you have a massive gamma ramp below the price, and no gamma ramp above.  4)But, those calls are super long duration, so I would not be freaking out. I just think there's resistance up from here, which was seen in today's price action - no gamma ramp.   I have no idea where it goes from here. I have no idea if BB is undervalued. And I always disclose my positions, and have no position in BB. But, it's not at a stable price right here - resistance up until 14.5 or so, and a fast, greased up slide down if selling happens. If you can get to 14.5 though, it's an express train to 16.25 or so.   Consequently, if anyone wants gamma write-ups on other stocks that are trending around here, let me know.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1906302.0|public|confidence|self|BB Gamma Conditions|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11lcs/bb_gamma_conditions/|some_ads|7.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'b6I9Gt_UPFCoiJr_LblSinzBQTNwo9r0lskAe1Va-uw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 31, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=847bfab53e4559b5b68dfcdda909219ef9e24c85', 'width': 108}, {'height': 63, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed963b6a57194ab60763d82d8798cce235e7330', 'width': 216}, {'height': 94, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=362cde1a27a8a4f78484271bef7f961ef9d7207c', 'width': 320}, {'height': 188, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1887784e44a58d115f8b2a40f37b3b5d4d9b7244', 'width': 640}, {'height': 283, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49637c515b727d6340869c102ce1ad79651e6996', 'width': 960}, {'height': 318, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27fb5494a0069cb64e32018a57953921b54421ab', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 389, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E90793h--CnLUDT_p28Yi1JHiw9_JGr-GHDxvPfhu3Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d50d53da7b23302f3d492136d12ad82462d637a2', 'width': 1319}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2021-01-20|EXPR

WHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK  I am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don’t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I’ll provide receipts. Additionally I’m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.  Military use of the program is simply not  “spying on you” bullshit they’d have you eat up on the 🌈🐻 articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can’t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it’s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn’t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in ‘killing bad dudes’ then they’ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you’re already paying for. I wouldn’t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.  Commercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they’re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN 🇯🇵 (should’ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I’ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn’t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn’t ripe with competitive companies like the 🌈🐻s would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can’t express enough how much of a buy this is.  Palantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they’ve been increasing the amount of ‘news’ on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they’re dumping heavily into R&amp;D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market.

On one hand, to maintain their presence in China these companies must comply with the demands and expectations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On the other hand, doing so comes with the cost of significant reputational risk at home.  But the influence Beijing seeks to gain on Western media companies such as Disney and Comcast is but a subplot in a much larger story, and China is playing a series of bigger games in which its Communist Party is thinking a dozen moves ahead of their chief opponent — the United States. Since China’s path to victory over the United States will depend in large part on our ignorance the what games it plays and the strategies it employs, the U.S. must quickly become privy to both to stand a chance.  Though the strategic game of choice in much of the world is chess, in China it is wei qi. China is employing a comprehensive strategy to encircle us across many domains of competition. The CCP knows it cannot win a kinetic war with the United States and so it is finding other ways to fight the hundred years’ war against the United States. And among those ways is using our short-term thinking, our hunger for market opportunities (aka greed), and our openness against us.  #### 1. China’s Most Dangerous Game  To understand China’s game, it helps to studying their primary tactic at the moment, which involves aggressively opening their financial markets to the U.S. in ways they never have before, and China is doing this despite [tense political relations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/us-china-relations-will-remain-tense-says-former-american-ambassador.html) between the two nations. Just in the last few months, China has given approval to leading Wall Street firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, to expand their businesses in China. In August, BlackRock [received official approval](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-gets-go-ahead-for-a-mutual-fund-business-in-china-11598687419) from the Chinese government to set up a mutual fund business in Shanghai. Days later, Vanguard announced it was moving its [regional headquarters](https://www.ft.com/content/46683cde-9707-4023-9378-52e6491f8817) to Shanghai. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is set to pay $1 billion to become the first foreign company to [assume full ownership](https://www.ft.com/content/f785d18e-e4c8-4b67-85ea-da71e9f8f6f2) of a pre-existing Chinese mutual fund business. This is all in marked contrast to Beijing’s previous requirement that Western firms partner with local Chinese entities to do business in China’s financial markets.  Why is China opening up their financial markets and why now? China is *not* doing this because it needs the money. Part of the reason it is doing this is because it wants to study Western banking models. There are numerous examples of China bringing in Western companies and letting them make money in China but essentially forcing them to teach Chinese companies that are positioning themselves to set up competing enterprises that will eventually destroy the China opportunities for these very same Western companies. When a Western company fights back via the legal system, as the Dallas-based Tang Energy Group has done against the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), they find China to be a formidable opponent even [when fighting on home turf](https://apnews.com/article/055b6cebe41649999d48fa1b5265fb19).  If you study China’s past collaborations with the West in other industries—its partnerships with Disney and Comcast being notable examples—a pattern comes into focus. Essentially, what Beijing is doing is laying down the foundations for an ecosystem set up to extract commitments and support for their policies from Western companies. This ecosystem consists of numerous interlinking components, including the [social credit ranking system](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-new-company-tracking-system-comply-comply-comply/), the national security law, and [cybersecurity laws](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/china-cybersecurity-no-place-to-hide/). With these components now in place, the CCP is inviting into China an increasing number of Western companies from varying industries, most of which will not be able to resist the prospect of tapping into what is now the world’s largest economy.  For its part, the CCP is not interested in providing access to its markets without getting something in return and what it wants most of all, is for foreign financial institutions to favorably represent and support their nationalist narratives and policies back home in the United States. U.S. banks and financial companies are the perfect vehicle for Beijing to achieve these aims since the financial sector has tremendous lobbying power in Washington and is by far the largest source of [campaign donations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-lobbying/banks-spent-record-amounts-on-lobbying-in-recent-election-idUSKBN16F26P) to political parties and candidates.  This is not just an abstract hypothetical. China has already done this, very recently in fact with Standard Chartered and HSBC, two British banks with operations in Hong Kong and the mainland. Beijing gave the ultimatum to these two British banks that if they did not publicly express support for the [national security law](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838) in Hong Kong they would lose the right to continue doing business in China. Both [banks complied](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/hsbc-standard-chartered-hong-kong-law-intl-hnk/index.html) in a move [widely criticized by](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-hsbc-hldg-stanchart/hsbc-stanchart-criticised-for-backing-hong-kong-security-law-idUSKBN23B0FD) the international community. But the CCP didn’t stop there; it also demanded both companies crack down on clients with ties to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The banks [complied with this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security-wealth-exclusive/exclusive-global-banks-scrutinize-their-hong-kong-clients-for-pro-democracy-ties-idUSKCN24L096) as well.  Another more recent example is the CCP abruptly [slamming the brakes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-founder-jack-ma-faces-backlash-from-regulators-11604442018) on Ant Group’s highly anticipated IPO, just days before its shares were set to begin trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Nov. 5, costing the company tens of billions of dollars. This came just over one week after Ant Group co-founder Jack Ma criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation with a “pawnshop mentality.” The CCP shut down this IPO and then [disappeared Jack Ma](https://www.ft.com/content/751c2500-f50d-47c9-8f04-a28ad62285fd) as retaliation and as a reminder that the CCP controls all private industry in China. Duly chastened, Ant Group publicly pledged to [“embrace regulation](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3108145/ant-group-executives-meet-chinese-regulators-days-trading-debut)“, but Jack Ma has not been seen nor heard from for going on a month now.  These are tactics China has been before and will use again with the foreign banks and financial institutions rushing in now.  #### 2. Why Companies Comply With China’s Demands  Why do Western companies not just refuse to comply when China makes these kinds of demands? Why would they support policies that so clearly run counter to the democratic principles of their home countries?  First, as part of the contractual conditions for doing business in China, the Communist Party requires foreign companies to not say or do anything disruptive to the stability of China’s social fabric. What is considered “disruptive,” however, is deliberately left ambiguous and open to the CCP’s arbitrary interpretations. Companies that violate this rule may not only lose their right to operate in China, they may also be required to forfeit the intellectual property they brought with them. To illustrate, if the CCP were to disapprove of something Disney said, Disney might not only be forbidden to release any future films in China, their highly profitable Shanghai Disneyland and other joint ventures would thereafter belong entirely to their government-owned Chinese business partners. This is likely why Disney has been [slow to answer](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-mulan-china/u-s-lawmakers-quiz-disney-ceo-over-xinjiang-connection-to-mulan-idUSKBN2630AZ) questions from U.S. or U.K. lawmakers about their involvement with Xinjiang, or answered those questions in only the vaguest terms. They do not wish to provoke CCP ire.  Of course, Western companies could always just say “no” to the CCP’s demands, or they could conclusively prove their commitment to their home countries and democratic principles by being willing to sever their ties with China. The reason they do not do this is simple: once these companies have invested resources to establish their presence in China, and particularly once they are generating profits in China, they have too much to lose.  But why would Western firms agree to such contractual terms in the first place? For the same reasons they comply when the CCP makes its demands: money. The prospect of tapping into the world’s largest economy is too enticing for companies to pass up. Perhaps corporate America’s proclivity to focus on short-term profits blinds companies to the very real risks of making deals with China. Or perhaps they do not believe China would actually try to manipulate them in such a way (though it is clear from the examples of Standard Chartered and HSBC that China [very much would](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/hsbc-standard-chartered-hong-kong-law-intl-hnk/index.html)). These companies also may ultimately be agnostic about the countries and the principles to which they are loyal. But for whatever permutation of reasons, foreign banks right now are happily walking into the honeytrap the CCP has set for them. Insidious as all of this is, one cannot help but marvel at the strategic genius of using our own short-term thinking against us. As I often say, China looks miles down the road; we look inches down the road.    #### 3. Why This Matters for the American People  From tech to fashion to the media, Western industries are becoming increasingly complicit in China’s manifold [human rights violations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/). I fear banks soon will be as well, but there are two bases for cautious optimism. One is the bipartisan support in Washington for sanctions against China for its human rights abuses. If enough political momentum can be built before China exercises its influence over American banks and their lobbying power, this could prevent serious problems down the road. However, there would need to be an international effort on this because the U.S. cannot deter China alone. Though the Republicans have sought to frame Joe Biden as being China’s choice, the reality is that Biden is not only a China hawk, he also has the diplomatic dexterity to bring world leaders back to the U.S.’s side for a concerted effort.  The other source of hope lies with U.S. citizens becoming increasingly aware of China’s game plan and articulating their concerns through their purchasing patterns. The banks need to understand that we know they have choices in this matter, and that the best choices would be those that are loyal to U.S. interests. Activist-led movements like the recent call to [boycott Disney’s ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/05/mulan-disney-china-hongkong-boycott/)[*Mulan*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/05/mulan-disney-china-hongkong-boycott/) raise the likelihood that Americans will become more concerned about these issues. The challenge here is that the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing economic crisis in America have created an atmosphere of self-preservation, and this has emboldened China to push harder and faster to take their plan to the next stage.  We the people can and should become more active players by bringing China’s nationalist agenda to the center of the national discussion — not at the expense of the other issues we care so deeply about—the economy, the coronavirus, the preservation of democracy — but precisely in the name of them.  **UPDATE:** Just today, the CCP has provided us with another example of how it seeks to co-opt foreign companies that do business in China. See [Xi Jinping wants Starbucks and Howard Schultz to help repair US-China ties](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/business/starbucks-china-xi-jinping-intl-hnk/index.html).

Clean energy over the next few years is going to 🚀🚀🚀🚀 in general because of the movements the USA will make in order to promote clean energy as a country, and the world as a whole will follow.  This means that there will be lots of new properties being built with solar panels, and there will be lots of people who are doing roof repairs swapping to solar panels.  TSLA already has factories in multiple countries, and has the infrastructure to quickly scale up to meet demand, which we have seen back with their model 3 production ramp up, and now with their massive funding, they should be able to do so much more effectively this time than the last.  TSLA will make a lot of money this year, next year, and onward off of their solar panels alone, and they will likely sell very well with the 25 year TSLA warranty in conseration.  Solar market recap/summary:  TSLA has the best solution, competitive pricing for premium roofing, and long term performance because of the 25 year warranty.  TSLA has factories in most of the world already, and is able to scale up really fast in order to meet rapid demand as the demonstrated with the model 3.  Now, that's just the beginning, FSD will have a massive impact when they achieve it because they will no longer be taking market share just from the car industry, but also from uber/lyft/grubhub, etc.  Elon has said before that they want to eventually have enough cars in production to roll out FSD taxi's.  They said initially, they will leave the steering wheel for user override, with the intention of eventually having enough of the roads being self driving cars, and the software being mature enough to remove the steering wheel (we'll see about it, I'm not one to go against papa Elon, but I don't know if people would be okay with that in the next 5 years +).  Elon also said in the same conference, that he wants to allow existing Tesla owners to be able to lend their cars back to Tesla to let them be a part of the FSD taxi service with all profits going to the owner of the car instead of Tesla, which will give them a faster ramp up time in every area because Teslas are popular enough, and the need for extra income is always there, like you retards know.    So, to summarize all of this, Tesla isn't a car company, or a solar company, or whatever kind you can think of because Tesla is really just something we haven't seen before, and it will continue to grow, and amaze us in how much of the world they will be able to profit off of.  This is also why we don't need to worry so much about Tesla competitors in this sense because they are so far ahead of the curve that they aren't playing in a fair fight.  Tesla is done with cars, papa Elon wants to get to a point where nobody owns a car, and everyone uses the Tesla-Express.  This will cripple the insurance business for individual car insurance, since only people who own cars will need it.  This post is getting long, and so I won't get into all the other upsides of their batteries, and charging stations, but I will say that the upside is just as massive.  Granted, at a certain point papa Elon said this robo-taxi would be ready in 2020+, I would expect it to be ready numbers wise 2022-2023, and infrastructure, and regulation hurdles in production 2024-2025.  I am not saying that TSLA will be uphill constantly on this trip, and that there is not a bubble, but what I am saying is that all of those things accounted for, the entire upside of the company, in terms of it's impact to the world, and how much the world will eventually rely on it, the price is far under where it will be, and this will be competing in the same scale as Amazon within no time (relatively speaking).  TLDR:  TSLA has massive unaccounted for potential on their robo-taxi, and solar roofing future, and even if we are in a bubble, TSLA will eventually be a name everyone knows by name because they own, or use one of their products.  TSLA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀   &amp;#x200B;  I will get better at writing these, I need my IQ to drop a bit more from WSB before I can get some real quality out.  Thanks guys.

I usually stay away from puts as I'm a bull myself, but the uncertainty we're facing now requires some kind of hedge and I believe this is one of the better hedges out there. You guys do your own DD as always.  &amp;#x200B;  **Fundamentals**  Twitter doesn't actually turn up any profit. They have a negative cash flow and this is despite being public for over 7 years now. Their stock price has hovered between 14$ and 60$ over these past 7 years and its valuation right now has reached the point it was in 2015. 85% of twitter's money comes from ads. This is due to take a hit due to Apple's upcoming privacy changes which makes it harder to do targeted ads. At the same time, as the pandemic is beginning (eventually) to wind down, online commerce should go down a bit, maybe not to pre pandemic levels, but still, and that will further affect ad revenue.  &amp;#x200B;  **Bubble insurance**  Whether we are in a bubble or not doesn't matter. However, due to skyrocketing valuations of tech companies, you'd have to be extremely retarded not to at least hedge your positions. I'm sure most of you read the arguments for and against the bubble on other threads by now, so I'm not going to debate those here. What I'm going to assume is that there is a CHANCE that we're in a bubble and that it may burst at any time during the next 2 years. Could be tomorrow, could be in 2 years, could be in 5 years, could be fucking never idk.   But if you want to hedge, Twitter is one of the good companies you want to buy put leaps on. It's an online tech company that's already losing money in an environment that's supposed to make them TONS. if that doesn't reek of failure, idk what does.  &amp;#x200B;  **Political headwinds**  I don't want to get political here, but we do have to at least mention the current situation. Twitter's decision to give a big fuck you to half of america is not how business works. If you're a conservative, forget about 'fairness'. If you're a liberal, forget about 'revenge'. If you want to make money, all you need to look into is just how monumentally they're fucked up from a business perspective. Twitter's user base has been hovering around 320 million mark since 2015 until today, while their userbase grew from 30 million to 300 million from 2010 to 2015. Clearly they've stagnated for a long while now. One of the reasons why social media has risen to be so influential over the past decade has been the freedom it allows users to express themselves. Big tech didn't pick sides in the beginning so their platforms attracted people from all over the place.   Now, I don't know what portion of twitter's userbase is conservative, but it's surely not inconsequential. Booting off the platform this portion of the userbase will only make the company's value go down even more over the long term. There are also non conservatives who value freedom of speech who will also bleed out from the platform. Less users = less ads = less money = lower stock value.  I haven't even mentioned the big tech antitrust and monopoly issues they're facing. And this is something the DEMOCRATS have suggested.  &amp;#x200B;  Conclusion: All the signs point to twitter's demise. The company has very few positive things looking forward to, and most of these positive things are market wide, such as the new stimulus package. Any one sign written above in itself is not a good enough reason to short the stock. But all of them combined, well... do with this what you will.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1791196.0|public|confidence|self|I'm calling bullshit.

Market cap is 650M simply because ppl no longer think there's future potential.  PETS is holding pretty well by itself but probably better if some big mamba can acquire it whole.  It has the licenses to send drugs all over the US and Canada.  Cons: Chewy started off their own pet pharmacy in 2018. Walmart and Amazon kinda did as well. Chewy is still losing money but wallstreet is pricing them as a strong growth company. Not sure why Chewy didn't just spent $1 billion and incorporated petmed express in 2018.  1800-petmeds website looks like a website in the 1990's.

With a population of nearly 15 million people, it is by far the largest market in Canada(currently accounts for 28.6% of national sales) and up until June only had 70 retail stores open. As of December 1st there were 255 retail stores open, with 106 of those store openings coming during this quarter, a **71%** increase from the previous Q.  &amp;#x200B;  [Store Openings this Q](https://preview.redd.it/a3dgzwnzgy761.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d814583986fb7625298fccb7acf7498c2e29664f)      **Canada Sales**  https://preview.redd.it/rybo0cz2hy761.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa860ae673e83298e217f4dafae906d704a0b2c  Health Canada releases sales data on the Canadian Recreational market every month, which effectively confirms that there is continued growth in the market. Sales increased in both September(2%) and October(5%) and I anticipate we see a larger jump in November due to a large amount of store openings in mid-October to early November. Aphria has shown its ability to continually grow with the Canadian market, as long as they maintain their industry leading market share in Canada we should see this trend continue.  **Brand Success**  Kind recently published their brands of the year award, determined by over 150 budtenders in Canada. Each of Aphria’s brands won an award, with the exception of B!NGO which launched in August. My focus on branding is specific to 3 product categories; Dried Flower, Vapes and Pre-Rolls, which make up **86%** of Canadian sales. The data below was collected using Headset, which tracks the top 10 selling products by category, updated weekly.    **Pre Rolls**\- 12% of the Canadian Market and 12% of Aphria’s Rec Revenues  **Kind Award**: Indica Pre-Roll of the Year: *RIFF*\- Subway Scientist  Aphria dominates the Pre-Roll market, their Jean Guy strain sat at #1 for the month of September and their Royal Highness strain took over the #1 spot for all of October and November. They boasted the top 6 best-selling products for September and maintained 4 of the top 5 spots for October and November. Aphria’s brands were #1 in pre-rolled market share in Canada last Q, a trend that will continue into this Q.  **Vapes**\- 15% of the Canadian Market and 14% of Aphria’s Rec Revenues  **Kind Award**: Indica Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Purple Monkey   Sativa Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Tangie Kush  Hybrid Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Pineapple Express  Another category that Aphria dominates, their Blue Dream strain held the #1 spot for the month of September while their Pineapple Express strain held onto #1 for October and November. They held 3 of top 5 best-selling vapes for September and October, and 2 of the top 5 spots for November. They had 4 products in the Top 10 from October to November and a recent PR stated they held their #1 market share position in both Ontario and Alberta in the last 3 months, ending Oct 31.   **Dried Flower**\- 59% of Canadian Market and 58% of Aphria’s Rec Revenues  **Kind Award**: Craft Cannabis of the Year: *Broken Coast*  CBD Brand of the Year: *Solei*\- Free  Aphria has a strong presence in the Dried Flower market, with their Jean Guy strain being the #1 best-selling flower in October and November. They held 3 of the top 5 spots in September, 2 of the top 5 spots in October and 1 of the top 5 spots in November. At the end of August they launched their new discount brand B!NGO which targets the growing bulk-offering subcategory(15&amp;28G offerings). This move immediately undercut all competitors by offering the cheapest large format options, with ounces as low as $4.18/G, all the while maintaining competitive prices with their *Good Supply, RIFF* and *Solei* products.  This will be this first quarter we see sales from these bulk offerings and its no doubt this move is intended to propel them from #2 in dried flower market share in Canada to #1.   **Additional German Cannabis Revenue**  In early October Aphria made their first shipment of medical cannabis from their Canadian facility to Germany. This cannabis will be distributed through Germany by their pharmaceutical company CC Pharma, a leading distributor of pharmaceutical products, with more than 13,000 pharmacies in Germany and Europe. They also launched several new CBD wellness brands in Germany, CannRelief, Evoque and CannaPet. Products under the CannRelief brand consist of cosmetic oils, creams and supplements. Evoque provides natural and sustainable products, such as face creams and serums. CannaPet provides products designed to help with relaxation, relief and recovery of pets. All of these products are distributed through CC Pharma and will provide a new revenue stream for Aphria.   **Speculative: MOON POTENTIAL**  ***Georgia Senate Runoff***  The most important vote thus far in the cannabis industry. If the Democrats sweep the Jan 5 senate run-off election, they would flip senate control. This would be the largest catalyst for US legalization we have seen, and the sector hype will be all you guys talk about. With a Democrat majority in the Senate, the MORE Act; which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substance Act would see the senate floor and likely pass; the bills sponsor is Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The SAFE Banking Act would also hit the senate floor and likely pass, allowing banks to serve the Cannabis industry. Most importantly would be full on federal legalization, while Biden has supported decriminalization, a senate &amp; house majority and nearly 60% of adults supporting legalization could push him towards federal legalization.   ***Aphria-Tilray Merger, Sweetwater acquisition***  Aphria has made a big splash in the US space in recent weeks, with the acquisition of Sweetwater Brewing and more recently merging with Tilray. SweetWater is one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US with flagship 420 beverages and award-winning beers. Aphria will immediately be able to sell beverages under the Solei and RIFF brands in the US with SweetWater’s distribution infrastructure, giving them a major entry into the beverage market. Tilray is a US based cannabis company, backed by WSB favourite Peter Thiel and a JV with alcohol giant Anheuser-Busch, but more famously known for its epic run to $300 in 2017. With a leading market share in Canada and a solid cash balance, they will be able to focus on the lucrative US market. Leveraging their connections with Anheuser-Busch, Peter Thiel and former CEO of WholeFoods Walter Robb makes them an attractive favourite among investors. The merger will effectively create the largest Cannabis company in the world, and both Aphria and Tilray are set to benefit if the democrats take control of the Senate on Jan 5.

The stock fell **16.69%** today.  I reckon this is just the start.   *Someone asked me to provide a simple description of what this SolarWinds hack is all about. So for anyone who is confused by the technical details, here's a thread with a simplified explanation of what happened and what it means.*   *The maker of software that is used in the highest echelons of gov, including the White House and NSA, was compromised by attackers who slipped malicious code into the software maker's trusted code without the software maker knowing it. The code got distributed to its customers*   *That malicious code, once it infected customer systems, opened a backdoor into those systems and contacted the hackers to let them know the door was open for them to surreptitiously enter those systems and begin stealing sensitive data on those networks.*   *The hackers did this back in March and their activity was only recently discovered - this means they have been inside gov systems all these months stealing data and spying on gov workers without anyone knowing until now. They also infected telecoms and other company networks.*   *Here is a list of some of the customers who use the software made by the software maker  (their name  is SolarWinds). All of these were potentially compromised.*   https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3fbca6fe66edb931cea54c7735e71c7ad7b166e  [https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1338389130951061504?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1338389130951061504?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)   *SolarWinds has hundreds of thousands of clients in all; it said in a Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure on Monday that as many as 18,000 of them were potentially vulnerable to the attack.*  *Both* [*FireEye*](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) *and* [*Microsoft*](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/) *detailed the flow of the attack. First the hackers compromised SolarWinds' Orion update mechanism so that its systems could distribute tainted software to thousands of organizations. The attackers could then use manipulated Orion software as a backdoor into victims' networks. From there, they could fan out within target systems, often by stealing administrative access tokens. Finally, with the keys to the kingdom—or large portions of each kingdom—the hackers were free to conduct reconnaissance and exfiltrate data.*  *This sort of so-called supply chain attack can have dire consequences. By compromising one entity or manufacturer, hackers can undermine target security efficiently and at scale.*   **If you're still reading this bullshit italics then congrats autronaut. This is where it actually gets interesting.**   *The extent of the damage is also difficult to get a handle on because Orion is itself a monitoring tool, setting up a bit of a ""who watches the watchers"" issue. For that same reason, systems also grant Orion trust and privileges on user networks that have value for attackers. Victims and potential targets must consider the possibility that these attacks* [*also compromised*](https://twitter.com/mubix/status/1338502543635329028) *much of their other infrastructure and authentication mechanisms using Orion's pervasive access. The extent of the exposure at US government agencies is still unknown; the revelation that DHS was impacted as well didn't come until Monday afternoon.*  **I'm just a humble lurker but this sounds like we haven't even seen the tip of the long dicking that SWI received.**   *The White House National Security Council, which reportedly held an emergency meeting on Saturday, said via spokesperson John Ullyot on Monday that it is collaborating with CISA, the FBI, and the intelligence community to respond with ""a swift and effective whole-of-government recovery.""*   [https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-commerce-treasury/](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-commerce-treasury/)  **Like I said earlier, I'm not an expert, but this situation is not going to improve for SWI any time soon.**  **Cleary this isn't advice and as always, do your own fucking homework.**   1/15/20 17.5P - all aboard the autistic express."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1700494.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ZYk6CXIUZ2-tBdF08fj2VgFkRGLSrNVpkAiHbAdKxPc.jpg|SWI Puts - Warm yourself at the garbage fire|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdedm0/swi_puts_warm_yourself_at_the_garbage_fire/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'AHO3UnsSu62-mIOUFsqlMnDFR9R03PF442vwlq5d_58', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NiVbky5M_mQwk6B8baiqgbZKDM1R_iT9n-eAg8IbA9s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=241b891b6993d0b00ddb9cd74b1307f452727f58', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 140, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NiVbky5M_mQwk6B8baiqgbZKDM1R_iT9n-eAg8IbA9s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=634dcc1848167b077d9bda850d9191e984bb6597', 'width': 140}, 'variants': {}}]}|{'2yf1rx6ku9561': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '2yf1rx6ku9561', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f216db64e8508cd0dd3f8715b4ed8efd6792f679', 'x': 108, 'y': 51}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aceea7e65f923568c98205b71626f710e00dc4a', 'x': 216, 'y': 103}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80125e626f9dde641aa1aab61764dcc60972a929', 'x': 320, 'y': 154}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a53f5f41bfab9360283f1dcdfc8e40366ad98690', 'x': 640, 'y': 308}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655755eeee7f84c5d8cf4e12effa5dfc25ab6256', 'x': 960, 'y': 462}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3fbca6fe66edb931cea54c7735e71c7ad7b166e', 'x': 1076, 'y': 518}, 'status': 'valid'}}|67.0|140.0||||||||||||||||||2020-12-15|EXPR

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW). I once wrote a DD on this company a few months ago and I was right with earning blowing away expectations however I was wrong with how far OTM I should've been and only made tiny profits. This article is not an earnings play at the moment. But rather to capitalize off catalysts and protentional breakout according to technicals.   Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.   They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.   &amp;#x200B;  [Atlas Air 747-400 ](https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6072d3f0ec86050ac1dc2ea0ffb802c61b4b110)   The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.  In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and  allowing them to grow operations there.   The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.     A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.  If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur.    AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.  The company’s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.    AAWW has formed an important level to watch at the $57.50 (blue) mark shown below on the chart. That level was supported back in September and October, and now it has become resistance after the stock fell below it. Although it appears the stock might be headed lower, a break back above $57.50 likely means higher prices for AAWW.    Therefore you guys could enter a long position on a break above the resistance level with a protective stop placed under it.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08142d1be63721c347d9ba4d66536690f3ecffc8   There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.   The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.   Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February the stock has a history of being at it's highest for the year around that time because it is their busiest season.  Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.    Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.  Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.   To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is in February and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.   Literally Can't go tits up.   I wrote this instead of taking my macroeconomics exam so I hope you enjoyed it.   Positions  \-57.50 1/15 Calls  \-Will look to acquire more February calls once initial breakout occurs going into earnings run-up.

I've started a medium sized position and am expecting this to go belly up over the coming weeks. Hoping y'all can get in before the run-up is too late.  **My Positions**:  https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=1059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69345e8adbae2e1bc707664b1a453fb3a63641f  **Background**:  SUMO is a cloud based analytics platform that enables clients to summarize their data and provide extra security. Think of it as a mini-PLTR with a focus on cyber security and issue management. They IPO'ed on Sept 17.  As far as their product goes - it plays well with all major products including AWS, GCP, and Azure. That speaks to their client base, which ranges from Pokemon Go to Airbnb, but includes whales like $BUD and $DAL - any company who values data and cyber security is in play.  [Financials](https://investor.sumologic.com/static-files/ede9f243-bb20-40a3-b3e9-d60835488125) look good - they've grown 50% YOY for the past few years with extremely low large customer contributions (2100+ customers). Revenue is $155m, which is like .0001% of the cloud security/analytics market share ($50b TAM). All revenue is recurring, and all clients are locked into multi-year deals when they sign. Clients don't seem to churn, and are in fact increasing their revenue spend as the contract goes on.  They do have significant competition in companies like DDOG ($550m in Rev / $30b in market cap), SNOW ($400m in Rev / $90b market cap), and CRWD ($480m in Rev / $33b market cap) vs their $155m in Rev and $2.6b in market cap. Institutions are starting to grab shares - 60% institutional ownership and climbing fast.   **Research**:  They break their business into 3 tiers: Small, mid, and enterprise market. They have 70+ openings (\~ 10% of headcount), with a focus on Enterprise and Sales positions, which would indicate they are expecting high growth and a focus on larger clients.   They've projected slower growth rates into Q1 and Q2 of 2021 at about 25-30%, which caused their stock price to fall off when they IPO'ed (since recovered). However, they are also projecting much lower costs, which will lead to higher margins and profit.  Recent reviews on Glassdoor haven't been friendly, granted most tech companies let go lots of people with COVID and those employees need a forum to express frustration. Their new leadership seems focused on growth and the IPO, which may not be fun for most employees, but will be good for profit margins.  **Play/TLDR**:  Earnings is Dec 7. Buy shares and sell covered calls to grab high premiums for Dec earnings and roll it into longer dated OTM calls in Feb/March. Unless they beat guidance massively for Q1/Q2, the stock will sit tight, and then gain over the coming weeks as institutions continue buying.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1642912.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3NqdqXSfgNVrj2uUVVY47b6vHRrK6zyoqGd9_5xnFKs.jpg|SUMO - Going Belly Up|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4xe1l/sumo_going_belly_up/|no_ads|0.0|||{'j4y6eiguwn261': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'j4y6eiguwn261', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=357a48d583e08462119b90878bd8ebbf2aa7a0d7', 'x': 108, 'y': 13}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa02d5a5b9f39cb91dc5596d867e9b2641efc671', 'x': 216, 'y': 26}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10abfb46f447dc5c456f65d301081eca24892305', 'x': 320, 'y': 39}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd48b7e08f78f10c5eb6ee0dc3d9c40d6d42872', 'x': 640, 'y': 79}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63c2cc556123258a9fec08996d1a2d9d2066cdf1', 'x': 960, 'y': 118}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=1059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69345e8adbae2e1bc707664b1a453fb3a63641f', 'x': 1059, 'y': 131}, 'status': 'valid'}}|17.0|140.0||||||||||||||||||2020-12-01|EXPR

There have been many companies coming out of the woodwork with new EV models. Any half-competent car company can design a sexy Tesla lookalike. The heart of any EV is the battery, and Tesla has traveled to the moon and beyond in large part due to it’s superb battery design and battery management.   But the liquid electrolyte LI technology Tesla and all other current EV companies use will be eclipsed in the next few years by solid-state electrolyte LI batteries, which have twice the energy density or more, charge faster, and are less volatile/more safe. The company which emerges as the leader in this new technology will likely dominate the market for the foreseeable future.  While there are lots of little companies working on this technology as well as many of the established  players, only some have made significant progress. The most prominent is QuantumScape, a 10-year old startup out of Stanford backed with Big Boy money from Volkswagen, Bill Gates, and others.  [https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)  [https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2020/10/this-bill-gates-backed-company-is-making-big-waves-in-the-battery-world/](https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2020/10/this-bill-gates-backed-company-is-making-big-waves-in-the-battery-world/)  [https://www.reuters.com/article/quantumscape-m-a-kensington/vw-backed-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN25U2PE](https://www.reuters.com/article/quantumscape-m-a-kensington/vw-backed-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN25U2PE)  Even though QuantumScape isn’t a publicly traded company it merged with SPAC shell company Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.(**KCAC**), which is, for the express reason of going public through a reverse IPO.   When the merged company becomes publicly traded it will use the ticker **QS** and this could happen as early as Nov. 25 th. Shares of **KCAC** will be turned into shares of **QS**, and even the exchange ratio has already been determined.

Additionally, sales of the iPhone 12 might be benefitting partly from the longer lead times on the Pro, as highlighted in our iPhone Availability Tracker (see here). On the drivers of interest in the new iPhone models, which has been concluded to be better than iPhone 11 models by greater than 50% of sales reps across carriers, 81% of the reps see 5G being a key driver of the higher consumer interest – which bodes well for the orders of the iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Mini as well (shipping today).

And BRK.B options can make you a ton of money. And I’ll tell you why.  But first, before we start.. did anybody lose a large roll of $20 dollar bills in a rubber-band? ..Because we found the rubber-band... *crickets*  Alright let’s jump in. Berkshire Hathaway has not been performing well, and we all know this. They’re down on the year and under pacing the S&amp;P worse than wheelchair kid attempting the mile run in 7th grade. (Still respect you for that Jimmy) However, regardless of $BRK.B’s piss poor performance there still is a ton of meat left on the bone. And it’s plain and simple: book value &amp; Q3 earnings.  This monstrosity of a company has a market cap of $505B.. yet their underlining assets are worth at least $600B. The railroads they own are estimated to be $200B, you figure the $140B they have in cash, their $120B in Apple, $25B in Bank of America, $20B in Coca Cola.. billions here in Amazon, Kraft, American Express, billions here, billions there.. I can go on and on.  SO why does this matter. Welp, Q3 has been HUGE for Berkshires investment portfolio, which is just a fraction cash flow and profitability.  Consider the real estate services, and how many people have been moving out of cities to buy in suburban areas. I don’t know about you, but I live in Fairfield CT, (not too far from Manhattan) and just about every real estate sign I see, (if not at least 80%) is Berkshire Hathaway Home services. Their railroads usage is up.. there’s more cars on the road since Q2 which means Geico has got to be up.. $AAPL alone netted the company 10s of billions in Q3 alone.  I mean analysts are giving Berkshire a strong buy rating and Warren Buffett is totally sandbagging the earnings per share estimates of $2.50ish per share..some analyst believe its looking more like $8-9 range.  With that being said, I have purchased some $230c for Jan 15th.  As well as some $300c June 2022.  They’re cheap and absolute upside.  In July-August I had 25x $215c for 9/18 which profited me $18k so you’re god damn right I’m taking another chance here.  Also yes I know this is the unemployment line, and yes I will post my loss porn.. balls deep.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.  # **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)** ***** &gt; Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak. ***** &gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far. ***** &gt; “The combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients. ***** &gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August. ***** &gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures. ***** &gt; “What this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we’ve already started to see some of that in the data,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they’ve reached a point where “they’re not going to get better; they’re going to get worse.” ***** &gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10. ***** &gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus. ***** &gt; # Political posturing on stimulus ‘hurting’ those in need &gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House’s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration’s proposal “falls significantly short” of what is needed. ***** &gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery. ***** &gt; “This political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “To the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don’t see something now.” ***** &gt; # Earnings season ignored? &gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market. ***** &gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week. ***** &gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout. ***** &gt; “I wish I could say that next week we’re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won’t trade this earnings season,” said Hogan of National Securities. “While it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it’s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there’re so many other macro factors that are more important.” ***** &gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders’ sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday. ***** &gt; “The housing market is still off to the races,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.” ***** &gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, “certainly the economy could use the juice.” *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6i8E0Lr.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGJke6U.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jkd6p4Z.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/sQiEyVc.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zksl2rH.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eBTMjg7.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xUN9dhd.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tu2aS7U.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TrguDpO.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4CSvumn.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GN3ZIki.png))**  *****  &gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching  &gt; There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we’re watching.  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.  &gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe’s Recovery blog.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We’ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. “Higher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.” Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Last, Friday’s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions—and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**  *****  &gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID  &gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**  &gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That’s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps-State.png))**  *****  &gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound  &gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August’s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.  &gt; Breadth in this month’s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it’s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**  &gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.  *****  &gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again  &gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**  &gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan-Part.png))**  *****  &gt; # Small Business Smiles  &gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**  &gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.  &gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month—Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.  &gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.  &gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Table2.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Components.png))**  *****  &gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic  &gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**  &gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.  &gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.  &gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Most-Import-Problems.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sentiment By State  &gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the ""Future Expectations"" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the ""Current Conditions"" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**  &gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC-By-State.png))**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9fUPN3h.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xQoRNmb.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday  10.20.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWeYEHF.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 10.20.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne3gwPi.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNGBGWs.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uPFnifS.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lk20RGG.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I007KF1.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I0WSfDw.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # Tesla, Inc. $439.67 **Tesla, Inc.

EDIT: this isn’t simple and I should write a short story on this.  I am generally risk averse. I hate losing $100 at the casino, I hate paying extra for guac at chipotles, I will return something or price match an item for a few dollars of savings. I am generally frugal.  But, I somehow had no issues losing 10k in options...  How I started  I remember my first trades like they were yesterday. I was trading the first hydrogen run-up in 2014 (FCEL, BLDP, PLUG) and made a few hundred dollars over a couple weeks.  I quickly progressed to penny stocks / biotech binary events and general stock market gambling mid-2014. I was making a few % here and there but the trend was down in total account value. I was the king of buying the peak in run-ups.  I managed to make it out of 2014 close to break-even to slightly down.  WSB Era  March 2015 was my first option trade. It was an AXP - American Express - monthly option trade. I saw one of the regular option traders/services post a block of 10,000 calls that had been bought for 1.3 and I followed the trade with 10 call options for a total of $1300.  I woke up the next day to an analyst upgrade on AXP and was up 50% on my position. I was addicted! I day-dreamed for days about my AXP over night success. I think around that time there was some sort of Buffet buyout of Heinz and an option trade that was up a ridiculous amount of %%%. I wanted to hit it BIG.  I came up with the idea that all I needed to reach my goal was a few 100% over night gains/ 1k&gt;2k&gt;4k&gt;8k&gt; etc. I convinced myself that I would have no problems being patient for the exact criteria that I had set and worked on some other trades.  Remember, the first win is always free.   I was trading options pretty regularly from March 2015 until August 2016. During my best week I was up 20k and could feel the milli within reach. I can remember the exact option trade (HTZ) and I was trading weeklies on it.  For those who have been in the market long enough, you will remember the huge drawdown of August 2015.   I lost half my account value on QCOM calls (100 of them) that I followed at the beginning of July and never materialized. I watched them eventually go to 0. It was another 10,000 block that was probably a hedge or sold.  In August 2015 there were some issues with China and all of us woke up to stocks gapping down huge.  Unfortunately my idea of buying far dated calls during the following days/weeks after the crash went sideways. I quickly learned that an increase in volatility causes a rise in option prices and I was paying a premium for calls that were going to lose value very quickly (the infamous IV crush).  I kept trading options into the end of 2015 and managed to maintain my account value positive but the trading fees for the year amounted to $30,000+. My broker was loving it.  I tried all the services, all the strategies. I created rules for my option plays: 1. No earnings 2. Only follow the big buys at a discount (10,000 blocks or more). 3. No weekly options 4. Take profit right away 5. Take losses quickly 6. etc.  I had a whole note book of option plays that I was writing down and following. I was paying for option services that all of you know about - remember, they make money on the services and not trading.  I even figured out a loop-hole with my broker: if I didn’t have enough money in my account, I could change my ask price to .01 and then change it to market buy and I would only need to accept a warning ⚠️ for the order to go through. I was able to day trade the option and make money, who cares if I didnt have enough? After a few months of this, I got a call from my broker that told me to stop and that I would be suspended if I continued with this.  By the way, I was always able to satisfy the debit on the account - so it wasn’t an issue of lack of funds.  Lost it all. Started taking money from lines of credits, every penny that I earned and losing it quicker and quicker.   I was a full on gambler but I was convinced that 8 trades would offset all the losses. I kept getting drawn in to the idea that I could hit a homerun and make it out a hero.  I eventually hit rock bottom on some weekly expiring FSLR options that I bought hours before expiration and said to myself - what the f are you doing? I resolved to invest for the long term and stop throwing tendies away.  The feeling was reinforced during the birth of my first born and I thought - what a loser this kid will think of me if he knew how much I was gambling and wasting my life. It was a really powerful moment looking at my kid and reflecting on this idea.  I decided at that point I was going to save every penny I had and invest it on new issues with potential.   Fall 2016  TTD, COUP and NTNX IPO ‘ed I decided I was going to throw every dollar at these and did so for the next few months. I eventually started using margin (up to 215%) and buying these for the next 6 months. They paid out and managed to make it over 100k within the year.   The first 100k was hard but once I crossed it, I never fell below this magic number.  2017 - I did some day trading but it was mostly obsessing over the above issues. I did gamble on a few options here and there but never more than 1k.  2018 - SFIX was my big winner, I bought a gap up in June 2018 and my combined account value had crossed 400k by August 2018. I was really struggling at crossing the 500k account value and experienced 3 x 30-40% drawdowns over the next 2 years before I finally crossed the 500k barrier and have never looked back.  I still made some mistakes over the next few months - AKAO &amp; GSUM come to mind. Both of these resulted in 20k+ losses. Fortunately my winners were much bigger than my losers.  I thought about giving up and moving to index funds - but i was doing well - just experiencing large drawdowns because of leverage.   2019 big winners were CRON SWAV STNE.   2017 / 2018 / 2019 all had six digit capital gains on my tax returns.   At the beginning of 2020 I was still day trading on margin (180-220%) and got a call from my broker that they were tightening up my margin as my account was analyzed by the risk department and deemed too risky. Believe it or not this was right before the covid crash. I brought my margin down to 100-110% of account value and even though the drawdown from covid hit hard, I wasn’t wiped out.   I stayed the course and bought FSLY / RH during the big march drawdown and this resulted in some nice gains over the next few months.  I am constantly changing and testing my investment strategy but let me tell you that obsessing over 1 or 2 ideas and throwing every penny at it and holding for a few years is the best strategy. It may not work at some point but right now it does.  I still day trade but I trade with 10k or less on each individual position. It allows me minimize my losses and my winners are 1-7%. I am able to consistently make between 3-700$/ a day on day trades using the above strategy. I still take losses and still dream about hitting it big with an option trade but dont feel the need to put it all on the line every month / week.  I finally crossed into the two , club. I know people are going to ask for proof or ban but I am not earning anything for posting and the details about some of the trades should be proof enough that I kept a detailed journal of it all. I have way more to write but these are the highlights.  Eventually I will share how I build a position in a story I love. I still sell buy and sell to early but I am working on improving.   TL:DR - I gambled, lost it all and gambled some more lost more. I made it out alive. I have only sold calls/puts lately.   The one common denominator in all successful people is how much they obsess over 1 or 2 ideas. Do the same.  All the winners on this sub have gone all in on one idea (FSLY / TSLA ). Stick with new stories or ones that are changing and go all in...wait a second, I didnt learn anything.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1546312.0|public|confidence|self|The classic WSB story - lost it all.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j98oyf/the_classic_wsb_story_lost_it_all/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-10-11|EXPR

A little backstory. I moved to the US when I was 16( 2014) from Viet Nam. Began Highschool with a GPA 3.8, everything was great, I was adapting to the new life. However in my senior year, my dad had cancer( bladder cancer, He is fine how, but its keep coming back) I become the main income of the house, my mom worked too but her income is not enough. I started to work for more extra hours at Panda Express to pay the bills and got slack off at school, graduating  with a GPA 2.7. All my chances for a scholarship went down the drain.

After a couple of months the farm got disbanded because of legal Issues and I became unemployed, and still now. Now I am 22, still a virgin, and have no friends at all. I decided to put my 5k savings in this volatile stock market and hope that I can make a little out of it, and then I lost all of it. I tried to play earnings, Jamf, RKT and got fucked.

I cried in bed many time for years, but now I can't shed a tear anymore. Not because I become stronger, but because I start feeling numb.

When covid happened they announced a temporary surcharge on fedex express and TNT international parcel and freight shipments starting April 6th.  Surcharges are still ongoing today, with rates being increased either 4.5x or 9x on August 9th (0.10 -&gt; 0.45 -&gt; 0.90 and freight shipping from China to Europe or US is a $1.60 surcharge)  On August 18th they stated-  “As the impact of COVID-19 continues to generate a surge in residential deliveries, we are entering this holiday peak season with extremely high demand for capacity and are experiencing increased operating costs across our network. We anticipate residential volume to continue to surge into the new year.”   Then they added another surcharge and fees which are effective until Nov-Dec depending on the package. For example, in 2019 peak oversize was 37.50, in 2020 its 52.50.   They also made their peak holiday season longer, last year it started on Oct 21, this year it starts on Oct 5th. Last year also ended on Jan 5th, this year it ends on Jan 17th.  They are now working seven days a week, delivering on Sundays to meet the demand.

For reference, last Christmas FedEx experienced record breaking package volumes. Since the pandemic, FedEx has shattered that record and are projected to shatter that record with Christmas again this year.

""I've been at this station 18 years and we have never had a busier summer. Crazy. My question is why only a 2% raise? Seems like a step raise would have been more appropriate.""  ""The pandemic has also excelled us probably around 2-3 years for progression wise. There won't be any going back to how things are because the main thing is a lot of the older generation that weren't taking advantage of online order etc. Are now doing so and now they realize how easy it actually is to use the internet and so they won't be going back to the way they use to do things and going to the store physically to get most of their products so they will just from now on get them delivered since they now know it's so much easier for them to do and they feel more independent while doing so.""  ""FXO checking in. Largely the same story with shipping, printing dropped off, but is picking back up. Xmas busy, 2% raises, shorthanded but the furloughed people are coming back I think this week...at least some of them. So I've been telling people to get the Xmas shopping sent off in November.

This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item’s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.  \- Partnership with ThredUp  Walmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable’s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.  \- Google  Walmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.  \- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)  Walmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.  Since the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.  **Acquisitions**  \- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel  Let’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.  \- Jet.com  The first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.  \- Flipkart  Ever heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.  \- TikTok acquisition  Some very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.  **Walmart PLUS**  Word is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&amp;go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year  **2 Hour Delivery**  Walmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.  **5000+ US stores.**  This is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.  **Some other interesting facts to consider.**  \- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.  \- Walmart’s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%  \- Walmart’s expansion in Africa, India, China.  &amp;#x200B;  **Conclusion/TLDR**  Let me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.  Walmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.

* case numbers don't mean much economically if there is no quarantine. * and lastly market is retarded.  as a conclusion, there are lots of indications for an incoming market crash yet market manipulation can keep the markets going up.  short the market if you spot an extreme euphoria in the market. markets crash when most people think it can't go down anymore. so have some balls and buy some atm puts with 1-2 months to expiry if you feel somethings wrong.  my positions?

If any of you think it is a pump, just ignore the post.  &amp;#x200B;  **Revenue Prediction: RDHL revenue will grow to 30-40M in Q3 and Q4. If their COVID Phase 2/3 is successful (likely known during September), we will be looking at &gt;50M and potentially &gt;150M revenue in Q4 or next Q1 and going forward.**  **Stock Price: stock will reach a solid 20-40 dollar range within two quarters. If COVID medicine is succesful, stock easily goes to 50 and has a chance for triple digits.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Details:**  So RDHL just released its earning report. This is a company having 3 FDA approved medicines, 5 medicines in various Phase 2/3 pipelines (including Opaganib for COVID treatment), 20M revenue per quarter, almost breakeven profit (-0.04 this Q), and 50M cash on hand. With such strong products, prospect, and financial statement, the current stock price is only about 8 dollar at a 300M market cap.  Revenue Increase Sources:  1. Movantik: this is the main contribution of their revenue this Q. Previous sale is 96M per year, and RDHL bought the medicine in Q1 from AstraZeneca. As COVID affects many areas of operations throughout Q1 and Q2, it only generates 20M revenue in Q2. As more doctors and tests come back to normal accross global, operations are coming back normal (which CEO and CFO talked about in their ER), so **the revenue is likely to be back to about 24M or higher from Q3 onwards.** 2. Talicia: Launched at beginning of Q2. Again impacted by COVID, this new product contributed almost nothing to revenue in Q2. During ER they say H. pylori test is resuming, significantly more call since June, and rapid care coverage expansion for this new product: it is added by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Rite Aid, and  Express Scripts  as the preferred brand for H. pylori treatment **effective July 1st 2020. This means this medicine shall start to significantly contribute to revenue in Q3.** This is a big market as 30-40% people get H. pylori, mostly child, and 15K people die from it annually. Talicia is currently priced at 700, a very lucrative product.  With the above two, the revenue can easily increase to 30-40M or more in Q3 and Q4, largely depending on Talicia deployment progress. If they can also break even on profit with strong cash on hand, stock will definitely trade in the range of 20-40 this year.  3.  Opaganib: This is the COVID medicine underway in various countries. In particular, ER said Phase 2 in US is 50% done for enrollment. Expect enrollment to finish this month. The trial takes 15 days from start to finish, so we may know something by early or mid September.  **Subject to positive data from the studies, RedHill aims to apply for emergency use authorizations in the fourth quarter of this year.** If successful, this can significantly increase RDHL revenue in Q4 and Q1 next year in US and globally. COVID daily case is &gt; 200K per day, even if only 1% patients use Opaganib, it is about 200K per quarter. Suppose the price is 100 dollar, it ends up with another 20M revenue; A price at 500 will give a 100M revenue. (remedesir is 3K)  4. Other catalysts: for one, if Opaganib can be succesful for COVID, this will significantly increase company reputation and existing product sales in the long run. Moreover, they also have 5 other phase 2 / 3 trials on-going, some with positive results already. Although they do not increase revenue directly yet, any positive news from these pipeline products will only keep stock price up.   &amp;#x200B;  Overall, no matter how COVID situation turns out, this stock has limited downside and potential high upside. Unlike all those vaccine companies without any actual product.   I personally think stock is a good buy whenever there is no news and dipping from ATH; and worth holding at least til year end. Options can be rewarding yet risky, I won't bet on anything shorter than October.   Finally, to the potential risk: One risk is COVID vaccine news --- it wouldn't affect RDHL's bottom line and base revenue increase projectile anyway, but may affect stock price in short term and ruin option holders. The other risk (or maybe benefit) is the stock has relatively low volume per day, usually only about 1% of total stock --- not many are selling, signaling strong confidence from current stock holders, but also making the stock susceptible to manipulation.  &amp;#x200B;  My track record: I only post when I am 90% confident of my predictions. One only needs 1-2 good play a year.   1. Predict Tesla ATH when it was 300 nine months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/dmaf04/most\_bullish\_er\_expect\_ath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/dmaf04/most_bullish_er_expect_ath/) 2. Predict TTWO and DIS mooning after ER a few days ago (in case some of you think I am pumping DIS after a good ER --- I made the call before ER as well!): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i2d6im/ttwo\_and\_dis\_next\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i2d6im/ttwo_and_dis_next_week/)  On-going prediction:  1.

(NYSE: FDX) announced an earnings per share (EPS) figure 78% above consensus estimates on June 30, package delivery companies skyrocketed. Amongst them was UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), which since has received five price target boosts, rallying back to pre-COVID highs.  FedEx's earnings completely changed sentiment towards package delivery; to understand this better we need to revisit FedEx's consensus estimates. Moving into June 30, FedEx had an EPS estimate of -72% year-over-year (YoY), but a revenue estimate of only -7% YoY. Wall Street's justification for this was that COVID flooded delivery companies with business-to-consumer (B2C) packages, i.e. packages brought by and delivered to households. On the otherhand, business-to-business (B2B) volume dramatically declined, as commercial activity diminished and retail shut down in early 2020.  This increase in B2C volume was predicted to tank FedEx's EPS by 72%, because B2C delivery has a very small profit margin. B2C means delivering packages to residential addresses, which are often spread far apart with few packages delivered per house. This also explains why revenue was projected to remain around the same YoY (-7%). B2B is the opposite and has higher margins, because it consists mainly of companies ordering supplies; this results in few stops with many packages delivered per stop.  Defyingly, FedEx announced YoY revenue growth of 3%, but a YoY decline in EPS of only -50%, meaning that Wall Street grossly underestimated the company's decline in margins from high B2C volume.   This realization has caused investors to rally behind UPS, which has recently seen multiple price target raises--some citing higher projected marigns (e.g. Cowen). Indeed, UPS's revenue estimate for its July 30th earnings is similar to its reported revenue from the same period last year, but its EPS estimate is down only 45% YoY (comparable to FedEx's EPS change YoY).  The question to ask moving towards UPS earnings is how COVID has impacted margins. Revenue is neglectable as it is projected to remain roughly the same YoY with falls in B2B sales offsetting the rise of e-commerce B2C deliveries; this has loosely been backed by statements from UPS and FedEx concerning the industry. *If we can determine how UPS has been doing relative to FedEx, we can guage whether Wall Street's EPS estimate of -45% YoY is accurate (neglecting some factors).*  **2. FedEx is Better Equipped to Deal with COVID**  **a. B2C: Second Mouse gets the Cheese.**  What price targets and estimates have neglected is the fact that UPS and FedEx have extremely different B2C delivery models, amongst other segments. Differences partially stem from a third delivery giant: Amazon.  In 2019, Amazon tried to reach a deal with FedEx to deliver their packages, and FedEx express could be important in reducing Amazon's pioneered one-day shipping cost. This business was, of course, extremely unprofitable, as last-mile delivery costs lowered margins exorbitantly. FedEx instead told Amazon to fuck off as the deal wasn't worth the rates it was offering.  Since then, Amazon has been relying largely on UPS to deliver their packages. Amazon even terminated its delivery service for third parties, Amazon Shipping, mid-COVID due to high volumes and costs--which UPS picked up the deliveries for. UPS hasn't been rejecting the services, partly due to them having *a single network* for all domestic delivery types*.* This is as opposed to FedEx with separate networks, and means that UPS can use all facilities and equipment affected from decreased B2B activity to assist B2C volumes.  In reality, this is problematic for UPS as delivering B2C packages for Amazon generates less than package delivery normally; FedEx realized this and dodged the trap. UPS is thus flooded with high volumes of packages that they receive under 5% margins for, reportedly. Browse the UPS subreddit if you want to see drivers complain about the number of packages.  FedEx has higher margins not just due to its refusal to offer services to Amazon, but also because their  partnerships with the United States Postal Service. With programs such as FedEx Smart Post, FedEx transports packages in bulk between its regional hubs, and the lowest margin last-mile delivery is fufilled by the United States Postal Service. Transporting B2C packages only between regional hubs cuts down on most B2C cost, and usually occurs by air frieght (this is important, to be explained later).  As a result of these issues surrounding UPS, FedEx has considerably higher margins in the B2C segment. This is one reason why Wall Street's projected drop in UPS's EPS YoY, comparable to FedEx's EPS drop YoY, is overestimated.  **b. FedEx... Big Fleet, On Fleek**  While UPS is recognized for its ground forces--its high number of terminals and vehicals, FedEx is known for FedEx Express, it's air-based shipping segment. FedEx Express comes unrivaled in air delivery, and to back this FedEx owns a fleet of 669 aircraft. UPS's fleet, on the otherhand, only numbers 267. How does UPS, with double the market capitalization, operate with 40% the fleet size? UPS charters roughly half its planes, and many deliveries are stowed on regular airline flights.  COVID has inflamed this situation by causing a dramatic decrease in passenger flights. With flight numbers down over 70% peak-COVID, businesses have been unable to ship products on passenger airlines and forced to rely on cargo airlines. This newfound demand and dependence allows cargo airlines to raise air cargo rates significantly in order to maintain profitability. (Check out the price history for [UPS](https://www.ups.com/us/en/shipping/rates-update.page) and [FedEx's rates](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/current-rates.html)). And while revenues for cargo airlines have been increasing, costs have been decreasing due to the [lower cost of jet fuel](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/eer_epjk_pf4_rgc_dpgD.htm).  This essentially makes cargo fleets such as FedEx Express the only, and extremely, profitable airlines throughout COVID. But unlike FedEx, UPS has been unable to capture these margins even with its 267 planes. This is because the rest of its fleet, 296 aircraft, are all chartered. In order to service B2C demand, UPS is forced to rely on these planes, but has to pay extremely high rates to the cargo airlines is chaters from, thereby further lowering its margins and EPS.  **3. UPS = Overvalued**  It becomes apparent that UPS's stock price, price targets, and earnings estimates have all been driven by FedEx's success, while in reality UPS is not nearly as equipped to capture profits during COVID as its rival. There are other reasons for why UPS might miss which we can discuss in the comments, but I believe that these are the two strongest bear-drivers.

(The informal and lacking source for the advertisements being less effective is that like 1 in 3 instagram posts on your feed is an advertisement - and my entire friend group hadn't even realized how populated all the SMPs feeds have become until I pointed it out. And ECON 101 tells you when supply is up, demand usually falls). The only notable advertisement that I've been able to formally recognize as coming from instagram was an Allbird advertisement - which has populated every single one of my feeds since I sent the link to a friend.  Data collection is already huge (look into an example big data is already being implemented [here](https://orbitalinsight.com/blog/global-parallels-realty-retail)) but I think that data collection could face some regulatory roadblocks in the future - see the GDPR currently or more recently, the invalidation of ""[...the European Commission’s adequacy decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/07/us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-statement-schrems-ii-ruling-and)"". The most valuable asset that SMPs have captured is actually the consumer and their leisure time \[there is a shit-ton of [math](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.8316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) behind this stuff too for those that understand mathematics - and you can also look up ""value of leisure time pdf"" for other studies\]. I anticipate that SMPs are going to start to experience the effects of diminishing marginal returns in terms of the revenue derived from advertisements as ads continued to become more and more diluted on feeds.   TWTR is just a place to express yourself, communicate, and enjoy catered content. Separate from - but not entirely mutually exclusive from - pure-consumption platforms \[AMZN, ETSY, MTCH, CVNA, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, SHOP, et cetera\] where the end goal is to purchase their good/service with some common currency.   Twitter's advertising service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was about $682,192,000 - comprising about 84.5% of their revenue - ('data licensing and other' comprises the rest). And Twitter really just acts as a root node to some other specific consumption platform(s) based on your data tendencies - sending you elsewhere based on the engineers' predictive algorithms. And algorithms would have to improve a hell of a lot to act as completely successful nodes to not only send you the right direction for some type of consumption - but for you to acknowledge the source of the utility and consumption was from their platform (though formal acknowledgement is already happening from the sell-side with platforms like SHOP, AYX - see minute 6:09 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FptWsowYkIM) for a quick example, et cetera).  The only viable and and regulatory-acceptable future \[10+ years down the line\] I see for SMPs is to act as virtual marketplaces - and to charge for ""premium"" listings \[similar to the advantage that stores nearest to the exits and entrances in retail spaces have\] - from which the advertisements and products would then have the most appeal. SMPs already have consumer data, the leisurely time, and a huge TAM - and my thoughts are all they would need is better predictive algorithms, less regulation (to collect/sell the data), and more advanced technology to implement simulation-like virtual marketplaces.   Why TWTR though? Recently I went to Portland, where I could not tell the homeless from the yuppies apart. Yet they were all for humanity, Goodwill shopping, and experiences as opposed to materialistic things. There is a ginormous TAM there, with money and credit anxiously waiting to be spent.  **tl;dr** *[I think]* as-is advertisement mechanisms have potential, but in order to implement more effective predictive algorithms to act as nodes to the consumption platforms \[e.g. me going to the Allbird website from my instagram feed\] there needs to be more effective sensory data collection which could (and has) faced regulatory roadblocks. Virtual and communal marketplaces are the future with premium listings at the front of the simulation space (like storefront advertisement in actual retail spaces) catered to your data-driven patterns  --- which will come with improved technology, more advanced forms of data collection and algorithms, and less regulation.   **tl;dr** *see below position*  TWTR $65c 01/21/2022 &amp; long on the underlying"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1361115.0|public|confidence|self|LEAPS/Long on TWTR|0.0|[]|0.64|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hvo9l7/leapslong_on_twtr/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '8gN0zwck-kfx01pKS8awneL1DsCd29D-kuOcQZWYxxA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2b9fc66fb6115e27ee2d78bb4c8802e36f34a21', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66648832f1b7b6969e9f2b5ff280df3631baf3f0', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89f8f923a42d03f34d5d6844e66f9785d3c4ef74', 'width': 320}, {'height': 336, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77cad82b8f95fee246f581432865b1e1b83f55a3', 'width': 640}, {'height': 504, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad7d77cc66a08299e989fe001a8cc054a7cddc96', 'width': 960}, {'height': 567, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ba3866df160f25e94dd6f1fa72dc5554a519c4e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 630, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vnCgYVhRvy8tUcf0Q4ygXm-sFTQ9KxK1W2NcLulyqPc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d5ecba2d026d254726c943b2b6aaaa2b6e2c2d27', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}||||1595400948.0|||||||||||||||||2020-07-22|EXPR

I didn’t look at the mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BionTech, because mRNA vaccines have side effects associated with the carrier lipids they require to dissolve into your cells and also they require a robust cold chain, and also because I don’t see why an mRNA vaccine would automatically have any functional advantage over a DNA vaccine; they’re both hacking the central dogma of molecular biology in order to generate antigens, DNA vaccines are just one step higher in the flow of information.  I had to relearn basic immunology and it took me like all afternoon bro, shit was intense. Where are the med school/immunology peeps at? Y'all should be doing this.    You can find my recent DD on NVAX [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hipojp/nvax_dd_buy_what_the_dept_of_defense_considers/).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **I. Inovio vs AZN/ChAdOx animal-model results comparison**  First, I’ll discuss the papers published in May on animal models from Inovio and AZN/ChAdOx, mainly focusing on the mouse work since that’s the model system overlap between the two papers. Of course by the time you read this, AZN clinical trials will have dropped, but this is still a useful exercise because (1) it allows comparison to Inovio (2) it allows comparison to Altimmune and Vaxart, as both of these are also adenovirus-vectored vaccines.  [Inovio paper on INO-4800 in mice/guinea pigs, published May 20th](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16505-0.pdf)  [ChAdOx paper on their vaccine candidate in mice and monkeys, published May 13](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.205088v1.full.pdf)  A. *Some basics on the difference between the INO and AZN approaches:*  AZN/ChAdOx: this effort uses a replication-deficient, recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) containing CV19 sequence to get CV19 virus DNA into your cells, where it can be read out into proteins that provide the antigens the immune system recognizes. The ChAd adenovirus vector itself is produced in cell culture, using cells that express the missing component of the ChAd so the CV19-recombinant and replication-deficient virus can reproduce itself.  Inovio: Inovio uses a DNA plasmid that gets into your cells via electroporation, using a [proprietary device the have been developing for a while](https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010137). Once it gets into your cells it does much the same thing as ChAdOx: expresses copies of the CV19 spike protein that can then be chopped up and presented on the surface of the cell, to be recognized by your immune system.  There are some advantages to Inovio’s approach: it’s easier to make and purify high quantities of DNA plasmids compared to growing and purifying replication-deficient virus. Inovio’s vaccine is room-temperature stable, ChAdOx tolerates room temperature but is better stored refrigerated or frozen and then kept cold once thawed. Inovio’s also doesn’t invoke any anti-adenovirus immunity (more on that later) so it can be injected many times with no ill effect, and the electroporating injection device is supposedly [pretty much painless](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/13/science/vaccine-coronavirus-inovio.html).  A downside to both is you have to wait a week or more to develop the immunity, unlike say a subunit-based approach like NVAX’s.  B. *Neutralizing antibody titers in BALB/c-strain lab mice:*  (“The virus neutralization titer was expressed as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution of the serum which still inhibited virus replication” according to the ChAdOx study, I believe this is the general convention)  [Inovio Fig.4a](https://i.imgur.com/qsGnttD.png), ~92 (using a lab-modified CV19 pseudovirus), compare to [ChAdOx Fig. 1b (red)](https://i.imgur.com/YU5YM1S.png) of ~40.   *INO &gt; AZN, but not by a lot*  *However, for Inovio, if we look at some other mice strains, and wild-type CV19 strains, and also guinea pigs which were used because they are considered a model system for human skin (important for Inovio’s novel electroporation injection method), we see higher to much higher neutralizing antibody titers.*  [Inovio p3](https://i.imgur.com/YQGXf52.png).  Read the text, it’s just a para. It says using live CV19 strains on the same BALB/c mice, instead of 92, Inovio found neutralizing titers of 97 and 128 respectively for the wild-type CV19 viral strains. Using another lab mice lineage called C57BL/6 and wild-type virus, they observed neutralizing antibody titers of 340, and for guinea pigs, they found a neutralizing AB titer of 573.5 using pseudovirus, and &gt;320 for wild-type virus.   [ChAdOx](https://i.imgur.com/P1Jjz3L.png) also immunized an additional mouse strain, achieving neutralizing antibodies of ~80.  It should be noted that Inovio immunized mice twice and guinea pigs were immunized 3 times.   ChAdOx mice were only immunized once. But there is a good reason for this. ChAd stands for Chimpanzee adenovirus- it uses   in addition to the logistic difficulties of producing large amounts of adenoviral-vectored vaccine. the ChAdOx/AZN vaccine can induce anti-vector immunity- as discussed in the intro [here](https://jvi.asm.org/content/86/20/11031), seroconversion (immunity) against the vaccine adenovirus vector (carrier virus) can occur after a single injection. This may cause side effects, and/or it may reduce the efficacy of the vaccine. This is why ChAdOx tried to get away with only using a single injection. There is no such problem with Inovio’s approach.  C. *T-Cell responses, INO vs AZN:*  Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cells (“CTL”; CD8+) and T helper (“Th1”; CD4+) cell counts via ELIspot analysis of interferon-gamma:  &gt;[ELIspot assay for IFN-gamma](https://www.rndsystems.com/products/human-ifn-gamma-elispot-kit_el285#:~:text=This%20ELISpot%20assay%20employs%20a,binds%20secreted%20human%20IFN%2Dgamma.)   This assay allows counting of cells secreting IFN-γ.   &gt;“IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 Th1 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops.” [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_gamma)   With this in mind, and as the ELIspot assay is preceded by an activation step where extracted immune cells are exposed to antigen peptides, the ELIspot assay is a measure of activated T-cells.  Inovio p6: “Day 7 post-INO-4800 administration, we measured T cell responses of 205 and 552 SFU per 106 splenocytes against SARS-CoV-2 for the 2.5 and 10 µg doses, respectively (Fig. 8a). Higher magnitude responses of 852 and 2193 SFU per 106 splenocytes against SARS-CoV-2 were observed on Day 10 post-INO-4800 administration.”  ChAdOx [Fig. 1c (red)](https://i.imgur.com/YU5YM1S.png) had ~2500 SFU, so pretty similar.  However, when looking at cytotoxic T cells, which are particularly important for virus resistance and immune memory, it seems in mice, the Oxford vaccine was significantly better:   Inovio p7 left: “The T cell compartment [was found] to contain 0.04% CD4+ and 0.32% CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Supplementary Fig. 3).”  ChAdOx saw  cytotoxic T-cells relative abundance at 1% in BALB/c mouse, a three-fold advantage for ChAdOx in this system, and 1.5% for CD1 mice. CD4 T-helper cells were at 0.4%, a ten-fold advantage for ChAdOx.  I’m not quite sure if this difference is due to a difference in preparation of the samples, but the methods seemed similar to me.  D. *AZN macaque monkey results*  Finally, rhesus macaques. The ChAdOx neutralizing antibody titers for monkeys were only around 20 compared to 100-500 for Inovio mouse and guinea pig results, and IFN-gamma T-cell counts only around 50 SFU, as opposed to thousands for Inovio and ChAdOx mouse results.  [Fig 2 from ChAdOx vaccine for rhesus monkeys](https://i.imgur.com/vLZxHgh.png). These results are not great. I think I’ve heard they may have given the monkeys a mistakenly low dose, or maybe it was the human clinical trials. Whatever. Anyway, the intramuscular injection of ChAdOx induces lung and serological immunity, it does not prevent infection in the upper respiratory tract, and still allows asymptomatic illness and transmission. All depends on human clinical trial results.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **II. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines that target the mucosa: Altimmune and Vaxart**  (Side note: you may be interested in [this comparison](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/08/better-coronavirus-stock-altimmune-vs-vaxart.aspx) between the two companies)  With respect to Altimmune, there were two studies that came out last week, week of 7/12. One, a [preprint study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.205088v1.full.pdf) from a non-Altimmune research group that came out Friday 7/17, and two, [a study from earlier in the week that was an Altimmune collaboration](https://www.uab.edu/news/research/item/11426-altimmune-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-tested-at-uab-shows-positive-preclinical-results), which used animal models to generate preclinical data on Altimmune’s intranasal vaccine candidate, AdCovid.  AdCovid is another Adenovirus-vectored vaccine like ChAdOx. However, unlike ChAdOx, it does not get injected into your arm, it is basically an nasal inhaler. It is this that appears to offer some key advantages. The tl;dr for intranasal adenovirus-vectored vaccine seems to be that it actually allows for sterilizing immunity in the upper respiratory tract, rendering the immunized completely immune and unable to get infected or transmit the disease asymptomatically.  Since we don’t have any published data for Altimmune’s AdCovid, I’ll be looking at the preprint study from an independent group. They first did a study where they did an intramuscular injection of a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine, and then measured much the same things as the Inovio and ChAdOx studies did ([methods text](https://i.imgur.com/lPHxeDR.png), [figure 1 caption](https://i.imgur.com/T7aDSU3.png), [figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/RAO3pez.png)).   Just to contextualize let’s look at the some numbers here. First, neutralizing antibody numbers, figure 1E. They gave the numbers in a slightly different format, but if I understand correctly, this version of the ChAdOx vaccine yielded neutralizing ABs of 316 on one injection and ~500 with a booster. For T-cell responses, it doesn’t look like this study did an ELIspot analysis, but looking at Fig 1G, we can see the CD8+ (cytotoxic, antiviral) T-cell percentage was around 0.8%, so roughly around what the ChAdOx vaccine produced.   I’m not going to go into the details of the rest of the 7/17 paper, since there’s nothing to compare it too. I’ll just quote the headlines:  1. “**Intramuscular immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung.**” They did a challenge study with intramuscular injection and found that like the ChAdOx study, this approach prevented disease in the lower respiratory system. 2. “**A single intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2.**” This is the big result, and the result the ChAdOx study was unable to achieve in macaque monkeys. 3. “**A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S conferred superior immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same vaccine and dose.** Given that the serum neutralizing antibody responses was comparable, we hypothesize the greater protection observed after intranasal delivery was because of the mucosal immune responses generated.” 4. On page 15 they discuss some limitations including possible problems with anti-vector immunity, that will bear watching in future studies. However, given that they were able to achieve immunity with only a single treatment, even if humans will seroconvert against the vector, once is enough.  **So in summary, an Altimmune-style vaccine was able to achieve better immunity overall compared to ChAdOx-style, and more complete immunity, because Altimmune-style were able to get the upper respiratory mucosal cells involved in immunity. **  To me, this seems huge. If it holds true that immunization site matters a lot as far as what parts of the body develop immunity, then the best vaccines will be ones that immunize the upper respiratory mucosa. This means Altimmune’s AdCovid, whatever vaccine the preprint study is developing, and possibly Vaxart as well.   Vaxart is interesting because they combine Inovio’s room-temperature stability with AltImmune’s mucosal targeting, as they are a pill form of another adenovirus-vectored vaccine. Because your oral mucosal lining communicates with nasal mucusal, this ostensibly should be similar to AltImmune’s nasal spray. (I guess the unoccupied niche would be an eyedrop-based recombinant adenovirus vaccine? They say CV19 can infect via the eyes so…)   Vaxart completed a Phase II oral Flu vaccine study [earlier this year](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30584-5), with results that beat the standard live-attenuated Fluzone vaccine (not 100%, but apparently no flu vaccine is). Novavax comes to mind; I’m not sure they’ve published their results, but [here](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-nanoflu-achieves-all-primary-endpoints-phase-3-clinical) is a press release about Novavax’s promising Phase 3 results.  Vaxart was chosen for [Warp Speed funding for a nonhuman primate challenge study on June 26](https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxarts-covid-19-vaccine-selected-us-governments-operation-warp), and [expects to begin a Phase I trial this summer or sometime in Q3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/20/2036357/0/en/Vaxart-Announces-Selection-of-its-Oral-COVID-19-Vaccine-Lead-Candidate.html).   Altimmune is [planning to start a Phase I clinical trial in Q4](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_F5AcRYosZ4J:https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2020/07/13/altimmune-making-headway-with-covid-19-programs.html+&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us).   So these promising candidates look like they may at best be longer-term plays. **However, if ChAdOx is confirmed to work well in humans, these adenovirus-vectored vaccines should also get a boost.**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   #tl;dr:  Inovio has significantly better neutralizing antibody results in mice compared to ChAdOx, decent T-cell counts as measured by IFN-gamma comparable to ChAdOx results, and ok T-cell counts when measured by flow cytometry, with cytotoxic T cells 1/3 of that of ChAdOx. However, with ChAdOx’s very poor macaque T-cell results, it remains to be seen (at the time of writing) whether the adenovirus-vectored and intramuscularly injected ChAdOx approach will translate with people.  Inovio has the advantages of being shelf-stable and easy to manufacture, and isn’t very far behind ChAdOx in terms of timelines. Also, there is no concern with anti-vector immunity for Inovio; it remains to be seen whether this is a concern for ChAdOx. Since we haven’t seen otherwise, there is the chance that Inovio will be better in primates than ChAdOx. It’s also possible they’re the same or worse. Some people think Inovio’s vagueness in their press release a couple weeks ago means they didn’t have great results, although I don’t really believe that and I just think they didn’t have time yet for the timepoints to all be reached and analysis done; and also they seem to prefer to publish, rather than press release, their results, unlike Moderna.  Altimmune and Vaxart may be even better plays, but have longer time horizons, with Phase I not likely to start until Q3 or Q4 2020, *but* they may benefit in the nearer term if adenovirus-vectored vaccines are shown to be effective.  Positions currently, probably will change soon:  AZN 7/31 65c  ALT 9/18 45c|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1357774.0|public|confidence|self|INO, AZN, ALT, VXRT: DD on DNA-based vaccine plays ahead of the AZN clinical trials publication|0.0|[]|0.96|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hudigq/ino_azn_alt_vxrt_dd_on_dnabased_vaccine_plays/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'E9a0FLZqIY5orwgMBpgoXdTllgr9xUYXw8_MgsQCq3o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 44, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21f374066d66c3f24cc4f780766098c8af544c6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 89, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=771e4a0964856aaf42888f3403911a6e6d1d78e8', 'width': 216}, {'height': 133, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24c39102a51c8d2693932a581254aaaf597e5e0e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 266, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2c45868815d03d5658619e9d08c5d3a5f425fb2', 'width': 640}, {'height': 399, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0975676569b21f849ba4855a549f982d8300695', 'width': 960}, {'height': 449, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3838f5bcbda25564d180c19f35b991491dbe6849', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 818, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QB7-8Nmfvws_XYRZaP7itB-O7N7jYPPFt5OEEeFrVj8.png?auto=webp&amp;s=fd1b6245f30f36e64927ab5d12d21b58a230403a', 'width': 1966}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2020-07-20|EXPR

I did this successfully as a broke college student, and it’ll work for you too.   The idea is pretty simple in theory.   **Step 1: **Get a charge card account from American Express (if you’re an ultra poorie with bad credit, you’re out of luck). Unlike a credit card, a charge card requires you to pay it off every month.   **Step 2: **Go sign up for Stripe or Square. This will allow you to process payments against a card, and the payments will be deposited right into your bank account. These services charge about a 3% fee. So you won’t get the whole transaction amount deposited to your bank.  **Step 3: **Max out your card by charging yourself via stripe or square. Then pay off the balance with money deposited to your account. Do this a few times a month. As you have shown to max your card and pay they balance (multiple times in a month), they’ll raise your limit. Rinse and repeat until your limit is $20k+.  **Step 4: **Now instead of immediately paying down the balance, deposit it into your robinhood account.   **Step 5: **Buy $20k worth of TSLA 7/17 1400p  **Step 6: **Take your $500k in profits and pay off your American Express.   **EDIT: **ONLY do this if you 100% know what the market is going to do. Your investment has to be a sure thing, but I think most ppl on this forum have a good bearing on where the market is going.  **EDIT 2: **No, I didn’t make any money doing this.  **EDIT 3: **I was wrong on my investment and lost all my money (American Express’ money), and ruined my credit score when I defaulted on $20k.

As a 20 year old, Carnegie mortgaged his family’s home to YOLO everything on the Adams Express Company in 1855, his very first investment, a railroad that gave 20% dividend every month, which made him an investing god among his social circle.  He then got a 12.5% stake in the Woodruff sleeping car company (inventor of the sleeping car) before IPO, arranged a merger with Pullman in 1860, and made $$$$.  He used these profits to YOLO everything again on the Columbia Oil Company at the height of the Civil War in 1864, which yielded $30 million in cash dividends in 1 year.  He then YOLOed again and set up a steel rolling mill and ironworks, which he eventually sold to JP Morgan for $300 billion (his share was $7 billion).  Then he gave all his billions away to establish libraries, museums, universities, scholarship funds, etc. just like ppl on WSB giving gold to random retards.

I’m going to state some obvious factual information on why STONKS ONLY GO UP.   First off we need to understand how PRINTER GO BURR. According to this link I found it will take 833 page prints until an ink refill is needed.   https://www.tonergiant.co.uk/blog/2014/08/how-many-pages-will-my-cartridge-print-before-it-runs-out/  Second. We will then have to approximate how many Hundoes are on each page. According to the mints website there are about 50 bills per page. Let’s do a little math equation to piece it all together.   50 bills x 833 pages per ink cartridge x 100 dollars per bill comes out to $4,165,000   https://www.tonergiant.co.uk/blog/2014/08/how-many-pages-will-my-cartridge-print-before-it-runs-out/   Finally when you take into account all of the printers working simultaneously and work out the numbers according to this information you will realize that the Fed prints over $14,000,000 per day every day of the year.    https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currency_orders.htm   Taking all that into account we now know that each printer THAT GOES BURR has the ability to print 1.4 M dollars, times that by 12 (the amount of federal reserves) and then divide it by the amount of time it takes for all printers to need a refill and you’ll realize that this usually happens once every 9 day’s or so.   Looking back at the DOW the last time we were at 25,500 was EXACTLY 9 DAYS AGO AND THERE FOR IT WILL ONLY GO UP.

When demand for T-bonds decreases, the federal government raises the interest rate to attract investors.  Equity indices and T-bond interest rates are usually highly correlated which makes sense. As capital flows into equity markets, the demand for T-bonds decreases which raises the interest rate.  Right now there is a market paradox as equity indices and T-bond interest rates are negatively correlated. This means there is tremendous capital in both equities and t-bonds. In addition, there is tremendous capital in commercial banks. This has been corroborated by CNBC who recently published an article stating that commercial banks are ""swimming in money"" from investors who moved into cash. There is currently exorbitant capital in equities, t-bonds, and commercial banks because the Federal Reserve has distributed about $2.6 quadrillion into the economy.  I predict a selloff during the presidential race as markets express opposition to increasing taxes on corporations. Subsequently, a vaccine will come to market and coronavirus will dissipate. Quashing coronavirus will mark the beginning of the greatest bull market in the history of the United States as vast reservoirs of capital in T-bonds and cash deposits will flow into equity markets.

After all the things that have happened recently from the hordes of unemployed investors that just installed Robinhood, to the gamblers who are out there gambling with their rent/stimulus money, I wanted to make a post on my view of how markets are currently functioning now, why retail will lose on average, why you should probably keep trading or investing, and why public exchanges should be public. I am definitely not a professional but I do like the markets that we have, bash me if you want to.  You can skip through to the payment for order flow part, but the first part is there for the newbies haven't learned basic market mechanics yet, I kinda need this to show why I believe the broker-dealer structure is broken. Skip if you just want to yolo and don’t really care about inequality ingrained into market structures.  *Copied Disclaimer from* [u/AsoftEngStudent](https://www.reddit.com/u/AsoftEngStudent/) *- This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random stuff because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions.*  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;***Market Mechanics For The Newbies That Just Downloaded Robinhood***  &amp;#x200B;  **What is Trading/Investing and How Traders Make Money**  Trading is taking on the risks from other people who don’t want to take that risk.  Investing is owning the underlying asset of the contract you’ve bought with the expectation that it will pay you over time.  In equities, when you buy a share of a stock from someone you’re taking their share of ownership in the company in the hope that its future value (whatever way you want to value that) will be higher and that you’re pretty sure they didn’t sell you some shitty bankrupt stock.  In bonds, you’re loan sharking out money to companies and governments when the interest rates are decent enough to do so, when interest rates fall other loan sharks suddenly want your high interest loans, and investors may want safety (also see bankruptcy). In derivatives/options, you’re probably buying lottery tickets or selling high risk insurance, you make money when you think the lottery tickets are mis-priced.  In larger equity funds (SPY), your taking on society’s risk that the world won’t be plunged into chaos, and you make money when it doesn’t fall into chaos. Generally falling into chaos results in negative returns for investors and less money for traders due to decreased need for people to trade with (liquidity).  In all of these you can either try to pawn off the contract as soon as possible on another person for profit or hold it until you think it’s reached where it’s supposed to be. Doing any of these things in practice is really difficult but also intrinsically fun. In the end though, what your doing is expressing a view on something that you think is better, something that might make you rich, or in something that you believe in. Generally, the public buys these on secondary exchanges, the original owners bought them via IPO’s or some other underwriting procedure.  **Trading is a zero sum game**  While in investing you get stuff like dividends that makes the game positive sum, when trading in a fixed space of time you have to compete with other traders to determine the best price. In the simplest way, when I buy from someone, I profit if the stock goes up within my time/range and the other guy loses. Those who are good or lucky keep trading, those who aren’t stop trading, those who gamble keep coming back for more, and those that retail trade futures or options get crushed into oblivion from the leveraged negative sum game.  **Broker/Dealers/Clearinghouses and How They Make Money**  Okay so you want to trade, how the fuck do I trade, there’s this dude on the street handing out cards for this thing that says Robinhood, that's a famous thief btw, and I don’t have to pay anything to play. *GREAT LETS GO.*  These apps are great in that they provide an easy way to invest/trade and offer the relationships between brokers, dealers, exchanges, and clearinghouses.  Broker’s are front-line people you call/lookup up to buy or sell an asset, or sometimes they call you, and they’ll quote you some prices. Dealer’s offer market immediacy meaning that when you want to buy there’s someone there to take your money for the contract. Clearinghouses pretty much look at your financials and say hey this chick has money that she’s good for, so let her trade. The exchange is a place with some rules on how to trade so people aren’t complete jerks, many lease and sell seats for the right for people to trade on.  All of these traders make money off some sort of commission. Brokers make money off commissions. Exchanges make money off commissions and seats. Dealer’s make money off their bid-ask spread, they will take your order at a certain time with the expectation that they can pawn off that contract on someone else in the very near future. Dealer’s like it when the people trading with them are uninformed of their views or the current consensus since that makes them money in the long run.  \*Dealer networks, public/private exchanges, exchange seats, market fragmentation/consolidation are also very important but I just want to talk about this.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;**My Main Point - For Those That Want To Profit or See to The Welfare of Society**  &amp;#x200B;  **Broker Dealers and Payment for Order Flow**  Now this all sounds great right, the entire broker-dealer structure. If your not a complete non-competing sucker you probably already know all this. One question you might ask is hey, if all these guys need to make commissions how can they offer up free no commission trades to the uninformed public ala Robinhood or other retail investor platforms. The main answer to this is payment for order flow, where a broker sell their orders to another trader (usually a hedge fund or institution) where they act as the dealer in the transaction, holding the orders from the broker and either making a market or taking the other side of the trade it in the hope of profit.  Okay so you get commission free trades, but in aggregate you’re giving your money to someone who really wants you to lose since they make money when you lose, and now that you’ve given them all of society’s money and they have sufficient volume to actually move the price. If your in something where you're leveraged and can get margin called (your loans aren’t good anymore) this is **REALLY DANGEROUS**. This is why trying to beat the banks and other institutions is beyond asinine via some retail platform vs direct market access, how can you beat someone when you are giving them you’re money, it literally takes money from the public and gives it to people who determine the consensus. This is one part of a practice called internalization, and is highly scrutinized partially because it incentives brokers to forward their orders to the highest paying dealer/market-maker, and much more importantly it introduces systematic risk by giving all the public risk to a select few highest bidding institutions instead of having it spread out across everyone equally in public markets. When I lose my money I want to be losing it individually because I’m the idiot, not systematically because there are traders who can’t or won’t take the risk.  **Mutual Funds and Broker Dealers**  You can say similar things about investing in mutual funds, except that’s not quite as idiotic since there’s positive expected return on a portfolio of companies that are actually generating cash to give back to you, unlike bankrupt Hertz. However, by gambling your money into one large pile for someone else to gamble (mutual fund) the risk is now completely spread onto that singular broker-dealer managing that fund. If you lose money stuff gets pretty fucking dark because now everyone’s losing money, and investors might pull out in a panic. A similar trend appears in the SPY, when Warren Buffet tells you to go buy the $VOO he actually has a profit motive since Berkshire Hathaway is in the index. I think that $VOO/$SPY is still important for diversification, but some percentage of ESG ETFs (maybe 30%-60%) might be a better option so your not handing over money to other people that might eventually take back the public's money like Exxon or Amazon.  **More Opinion and Some Fucking Compassion**  I’m not saying that this is a bad thing, or that it’s definitely happening, or that the SEC isn’t regulating broker-dealers, or that I'm trying to start some kind of conspiracy theory, or that your orders aren’t actually getting executed at the price their supposed to (but they probably at least have been in the past). But giving someone this kind of power seems like a not so smart thing to do especially right now when financial pundits are out insulting retail investors that are providing liquidity in a time of risk, regardless of whether you think it’s a bubble or not. Many who are just desperately peddling for money to continue their lives in the midst of a pandemic.  Labeled “millennial day traders” and “we have to wait until they get blow out”. With current outages at brokers, retail traders not given the option of getting out of futures positions during the oil crash, and again the complete disregard for the people that these companies and institutions are supposed to serve maybe its time to think about ways to solve this problem. Small owners of wealth in this system need to hand over their wealth over to larger institutions to express their views, and often these views are opposed to each other. More importantly I don’t think that the financial system has to carry the entire burden of the risk assigned to it, there are literally people signing up to take this risk as I’m writing this.  This is important because these issues mean that our free market is not healthy, the heart of the way wealth is created, destroyed, and transferred to working productivity is not functioning, at the very least it may not be transparent enough for the public to be able to either confirm or deny its effectiveness. Even as a Democrat and interventionist I believe that this is a problem. I believe in J. Powell’s printer going BRRRRR and I would vote that is working very well at the moment given the alternatives.  What I think is needed is for the financial experts who are trusted with the well being of our economic health, to share the risk, take a greater role in educating the public and take a step back from trying to manage all of that risk on their own, often summarized as forecasting the future. None of these ideas are new, but given the increasing relevance of the $ROPE meme and an incident where someone was able to take out $700,000 in leverage apparently past the possible issuer of the loan, the clearinghouse, broker, dealer, and the people who eventually took the other side of that trade is not acceptable on any side and deserves some fucking compassion.  One solution is to get exchanges to compete directly with brokers-dealers for public order flow, meaning they offer platforms connected directly to the exchange. Brokers and dealers are middlemen that do not need to exist in the age of the internet. Making the public exchanges truly public by adding infinite open retail seats at reasonable commission, and allowing the public to openly trade on them along with the help of clearinghouses to ensure safety is a pretty good option in my opinion. Traders will find renewed interest in the markets, advisors will have more clients, exchanges will receive increased commission, current broker dealers will be forced to compete within this structure, and the public will know better what they are buying and have a personal stake in its future instead of having the world’s equity owned buy large players at least in some markets.  I could make arguments about how quantitative easing transfers the wealth from the young and poor to those who are wealthy and elderly but frankly I don’t give a shit. One of the core beliefs of capitalism is that you have a vote via your productivity and the system we have rejects our votes, and that people may not be voting in their best interests due either to ignorance, boredom, or more likely the current state of desperation. The public's faith in capital markets is actually what enables capital markets. Instead there's a bunch of new traders who in there desperation are turning to the markets to actually provide them something by fucking gambling. I'm concerned that the systems that we have in place have no faith because they deserve no faith, that opportunity is met with monopoly, and that capital is not being allocated to where it is most needed for the future.  But I’m also just some random willfully ignorant upset guy on the internet, I am not a financial expert and would be happy to hear something on this, because currently I’m in my parent’s house looking for a job legitimately eating something close to tendies and while I’m posting this on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1277486.0|public|confidence|self|NDDD: The broker-dealer structure is broken, why you lose, public exchanges, and market mechanics for newbies|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9p2os/nddd_the_brokerdealer_structure_is_broken_why_you/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-06-15|EXPR

It can be used to express a bearish view on the market, if you expect the market to **fall fast or fall a lot**  You can find a lot about it on the internet and it’s really not rocket science so I’ll [send you to Fidelity for the technical deets](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/1x2-ratio-vertical-spread-puts) and just focus on how we use it to fade a rally.  # How do you use it  When the market is toppy and vols are coming down, it’s an easy way to fade the market with limited risk in case the rally continues hard.  You deploy it with 1-2m tenor options and keep it for 2w at most. The key aspect is that the option has a good payout profile as shown above: **on a short-term horizon your loss profile is very contained** even in the triangular loss area where the loss is highest.  If market falls fast you profit, if markets rally hard you lose 0, if markets move sideways you bleed a bit of theta. The point being, if the market keeps rallying you get a second chance to try again.  # Pros  1. Protects you from bad timing: if you want to go short and the market rallies, you lose nothing and try again 2. It works well to fade an equity rally because usually at the top of the market i) vols are low and ii) the fall can be fast 3. *Bonus: you see the triangular loss area? When you fall there, usually vols are moving up and this gives you another boost to limit losses*  # Cons  1. Works only if the drop is large and/or fast, and profits will always lag a vanilla put 2. Has negative theta at-the-money for the first week - if the market stays flat, you bleed some 3. Has 3x transaction costs than a normal put  # Is now a good moment to use it  It beats buying vanilla outright puts for sure in terms of premium deployed, but with VIX at 29 it's still nowhere near a good moment to be long vol - but again, beats buying outrights. With vols &lt;15 at index level, this becomes a no-brainer  # Disclaimer  Remember that like any other option structure, this a specialized tool for a specific task. It will not make money per se, rather it will help you express a view with a control on the loss profile.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1230549.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tw4uYO89qtNfhq_W9B6TE4IaVvApeSNUooQTpoBz1Nk.jpg|Fading the rally with contained risk: the 1x2 put spread|0.0|[]|0.83|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun25l/fading_the_rally_with_contained_risk_the_1x2_put/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'ipUzbxQ6-DYrpViNNiQ4VQq_oJgNOZRsIPOG5SpNq3A', 'resolutions': [{'height': 59, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cTlas7tLngcxiX2V2jDwUlYDrpqJldAmXyhdxh1bTtU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc3a54f5ab56cc989b3bbdf9f1af149a1238f15', 'width': 108}, {'height': 118, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cTlas7tLngcxiX2V2jDwUlYDrpqJldAmXyhdxh1bTtU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b88eb5bcd050530753a1ac294c4e53edb0d9853', 'width': 216}, {'height': 176, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cTlas7tLngcxiX2V2jDwUlYDrpqJldAmXyhdxh1bTtU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0981b4bdf71ca84489497d2b2fd6bb801d3ca6e', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 330, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cTlas7tLngcxiX2V2jDwUlYDrpqJldAmXyhdxh1bTtU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=19e13098920bdabfcd3090cb8dd12038063b4ae7', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}|{'g96ctvidlb251': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'g96ctvidlb251', 'm': 'image/jpg', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc48bb15791d7c5f6bffe26ed60b1439cdfdd08', 'x': 108, 'y': 53}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec1ce8768cf2ee5294e0b2831a5a4f28d7ae3fb', 'x': 216, 'y': 107}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c382d8583c46eefca58fc6e13d4fd65a55d765', 'x': 320, 'y': 159}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd9091c2b469640998e39c910a8899e5d8827dd5', 'x': 640, 'y': 318}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10bb8063df1652e30284792b319dbecbc0c52fc0', 'x': 960, 'y': 478}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e336a8475159b260175bb7f908e96076015d0eee', 'x': 1080, 'y': 537}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g96ctvidlb251.jpg?width=2588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ceb4752d2a00e0f9bf399c853defc9c3c004be9', 'x': 2588, 'y': 1289}, 'status': 'valid'}}|77.0|140.0||||||||||||||||||2020-06-01|EXPR

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.  # **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)** ***** &gt; The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead. ***** &gt; Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market. ***** &gt; The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv. ***** &gt; Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China’s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters.  ***** &gt; President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump’s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China. ***** &gt; “Hovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ***** &gt; Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade. ***** &gt; “We saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,” she said. “The market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.” ***** &gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter. ***** &gt; “There’s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,” he said. “There’s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.” ***** &gt; Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week.  ***** &gt; “This cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we’ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,” he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn’t always signal positives.  ***** &gt; “On average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,” he said. ***** &gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&amp;P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days. ***** &gt; But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. “When we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,” he said.  ***** &gt; The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.   ***** &gt; “These stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don’t think we’ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there’s a change in progress on a vaccine,” he said. ***** &gt; President Trump’s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism. ***** &gt; Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter’s stock hardest.   ***** &gt; Emanuel said technology’ is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues. ***** &gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jgJsTbC.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cn1jSFW.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/TMD5don.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lMnJorQ.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kHa6HqT.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZZOjRw4.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FigEirb.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MjWiE2F.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wh12Zf4.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8t94L91.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yC7JiMI.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nzEoxkl.png))**  *****  # Weekly Market Performance – May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.  &gt; # Equities  &gt; US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&amp;P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “The S&amp;P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Which would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn’t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.”  &gt; The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.  &gt; Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.  &gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.  &gt; # International Stocks  &gt; The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng’s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong’s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.  &gt; The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.  &gt; European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.  &gt; # Fixed Income and Commodities  &gt; Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.  &gt; Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.  &gt; Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.  &gt; Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.  &gt; # Looking Ahead  &gt; Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.  &gt; On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday’s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.  *****  # Strong Breadth Surge  &gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.  &gt; Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn’t mean they’ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy’s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday’s close, 96% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.  &gt; Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&amp;P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “Breadth surges like we’ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.”  *****  # DJIA Up Seven Straight on June’s First Trading Day  &gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/277f4afe57244973b48e6bc7c0844a6d/0d36c25bfef3f384-d6/s500x750/96efe19dba3ae99c075a91a11e892ad69fa23e56.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3cdaccd662828f8641c2e822c6df281/0d36c25bfef3f384-33/s500x750/6406f9afe4080788669a930cbe8dd4fb4a52ec28.jpg))**  *****  # Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month  &gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37b672810df8d9c17e4fc69d49aaa9e8/439e24c2bd089fd0-d8/s500x750/5dc0af4ea6dbde69f39defca04e69534e9ac2eb7.jpg))**  *****  # May's Top Performing Stocks  &gt; After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.  &gt; This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.  &gt; Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.  &gt; In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052920-Best-MTD.png))**  *****  # Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991  &gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&amp;P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-SP-Above.png))**  *****  # Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm  &gt; The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.  &gt; Equity fund flows remain negative. While there’s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.  &gt; Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-Flows-1.png))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$ZM**  &gt; * **$CRWD**  &gt; * **$DKS**  &gt; * **$DOCU**  &gt; * **$WORK**  &gt; * **$CPB**  &gt; * **$CBRL**  &gt; * **$AVGO**  &gt; * **$CLDR**  &gt; * **$SJM**  &gt; * **$ATHM**  &gt; * **$CIEN**  &gt; * **$AEO**  &gt; * **$TTC**  &gt; * **$BZUN**  &gt; * **$APPS**  &gt; * **$GOOS**  &gt; * **$HQY**  &gt; * **$HHR**  &gt; * **$DCI**  &gt; * **$EXPR**  &gt; * **$SMAR**  &gt; * **$VRA**  &gt; * **$CMD**  &gt; * **$AMBA**  &gt; * **$ESTC**  &gt; * **$TIF**  &gt; * **$CNK**  &gt; * **$ZUO**  &gt; * **$MDB**  &gt; * **$BBW**  &gt; * **$NGL**  &gt; * **$MIK**  &gt; * **$GHG**  &gt; * **$ENS**  &gt; * **$SCWX**  &gt; * **$PD**  &gt; * **$EVRI**  &gt; * **$PLX**  &gt; * **$YEXT**  &gt; * **$GPS**  &gt; * **$SAIC**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D4J2yE.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 6.1.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QTN7mSn.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 6.1.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j1DpFQy.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ij1xmhw.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EIpBZjj.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvne0Pg.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lE0Nrw2.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 6.4.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wyHcBay.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 6.4.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iZigl8T.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 6.5.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b2NLnrm.png)) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 6.5.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $179.48 &gt; **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

This unprecedented amount of credit card debt was surveyed at the peak of the longest bull market in our country’s history. Now, just two months removed, I estimate that this figure is easily over $1 trillion dollars as incomes dissipate but household bills continue to mount. Released in conjunction with this report were the default rates—the figures that indicate whether consumers can meet their current debt obligations. The overall rate of borrowers in delinquency was 5.32% in the fourth quarter. On the surface that may seem insignificant, but this level of default is the highest it has been in nearly a decade. This is largely attributable to two things: egregiously high interest rates and excessive borrowing.     **Current Macroeconomic Conditions**  As of May 22, over 30 million have applied for unemployment benefits. If reopening is not as seamless as corporations anticipate, this will be an even worse bloodbath.    **Purpose of Analysis**  To determine if financial institutions that engage in subprime lending to consumers are fairly priced and to evaluate if opportunities to sell-short exist. For purposes of this analysis, macrolevel government interference and blatant manipulation by the Federal Reserve will not be considered.      Scope of Testing     I have selected three financial institutions I believe are the pinnacles of consumer lending: Capital One (“Capital One”), Synchrony Bank (“Synchrony”), and American Express (“Amex”). Capital One and Synchrony cater towards individuals with lower credit scores while American Express is a more stringent lender. As such, I consider Amex to be a tier above the others in terms of credit quality and therefore will be used as the benchmark for the others.       Synchrony Financial (SYF)      On April 22, Synchrony released their 10Q for quarter one of fiscal 2020 (the first quarter impacted by COVID-19). Quarter over quarter, Synchrony has increased their Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) 6% to a rather staggering 11%--nearly doubling their anticipated defaults. Is it sufficient? It might be. However, if we consider the unemployment number to be 26.5 million (the latest benefit filing number) then that equates to 17% of the US working population being out of work. It is not likely all unemployed persons have a credit line with Synchrony nor is it likely that all unemployed will default on their loan commitments. However, it is important to be cognizant of the financial strain companies that rely on receivables will have during this recessionary-like period.       10% of Synchrony’s outstanding loans receivable were consolidated in Texas. Texas is an oil-fueled economy and its demand is diminishing. Oil is cyclical and in the past when profits fall, it was not abnormal to see mass layoffs. While not overtly material, this figure may provide a glimpse as to who the clients of Synchrony are.       **Evaluation of Financial Position – Synchrony**      Revenues are down 74% QOQ primarily due to a charge to increase CECL. Fundamentally speaking, not much has changed within Synchrony’s operations during Q1. I had expected borrowings to be greater. I anticipate borrowings will increase in Q2 earnings. Synchrony’s balance sheet is stronger than I had expected. I do think operations will struggle for the next 12-18 months due to lingering issues birthed during the COVID-19 pandemic.      The following passage came directly from Synchrony’s 10Q:       Asset quality. Prior to COVID-19, we had experienced slightly improving asset quality trends that reflected stable U.S. unemployment rates and consumer confidence. We anticipate that the recent increases in filings for unemployment benefits in the U.S., while partially mitigated by the effects of governmental actions such as the CARES Act, will now result in an increase in the Company’s delinquencies and net charge-off rate in 2020, as compared to the prior year. Similarly, we have experienced an increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2020 attributable to the impact of COVID-19. To the extent the current environment continues beyond our expectations or deteriorates further, we may experience further increases to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses related to COVID-19.      I believe the CECL figure is the biggest threat to Synchrony’s overall value. If conditions do not improve, I certainly expect its value to be adversely affected.        I did not include my research pertinent to Amex and Capital One as I feel Synchrony is the most at risk. I do believe consumer lending is going to suffer tremendously, though. I did not link my 10K/Q excel, but if this gains traction, I will.      **TL;DR: SYF $12p 9/18/20**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1212169.0|public|confidence|self|The case against Synchrony Financial (SYF)|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gowmqr/the_case_against_synchrony_financial_syf/|all_ads|6.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-05-23|EXPR

For every few shitposts, you occasionally stumble across golden DD and trusted traders among the community.  I know these gains aren't much against the heavyweight traders here, but I hope this post serves as inspiration for new traders like myself. It was a painful 3 day journey of diamond hands (to an intelligible extent). For all you autists I marked which trades correspond to what since StreetSmartEdge isn't the most intuitive when analyzing trade history:  **5/18**: Purchased lots 1, 2, 3 (screenshot below) as SPY hit $295 in the morning. We hit $296.75 (HOTD) in the afternoon and I'm up $3K. **Down $1K as SPY hit $294.94 from EOD sell off and my greed.**  **5/19**: Down $1.5K as SPY dips to $293.50 at open. Up $2.5K as we hit $296.21 (HOTD) in the afternoon. Feeling good about myself - picked up 20 FB 5/22 222.50c for $4,500 as shares hit $218 and as Facebook Shops is being announced live. MINUTES LATER - MRNA news craters SPY to $292.02 and FB to $216.88. **Down $7.4K total ($5.4K on SPY and $2K on FB)**  [Didn't screenshot my FB losses here as I just shut down my PC after a depressing day](https://preview.redd.it/jdfgrpiic1051.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398266448c2e2e0b841e7baf2bdfda6fd3173e60)  **5/20 10:07AM ET: Up $9.2K total** ($1.2K on SPY and $8K on FB)  https://preview.redd.it/goco21nkc1051.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=160d910a350b9a837092d087e3e1319f9e32bb86  **5/20 11:19AM ET:** Sold lot 1 at $63 loss - a win considering same day expiration after being down $1K. **Up $16.5K total** ($3.7K on SPY and $12.8K on FB)  https://preview.redd.it/86mnhm7mc1051.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=411179efffa0d1f3e569c262cf413dcce53c9a2e  **5/20 3:26PM ET**: Made autistic trades in between, but sold 14 5/22 FB calls (still have 4 left) and SPY calls. **Realized $13.8K profit** ($1.9K on SPY and $11.9K on FB). Sadly left $2K on the table for SPY by being greedy.  https://preview.redd.it/t3mn0whnc1051.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fcbe68c93436ce6ae1461beb03579af7a6efbdf  **END RESULT: Up $18.5K profit (incl. unrealized)** \- ($16.7K on FB and $1.8K on SPY)  Also current positions: Thoughts?  https://preview.redd.it/flczbfjpc1051.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4929fb9651d0742b453906bb2a46b40b288d6bc9  **tl;dr** in the red $7.5K and made out with $18.5K profit ($13.8K realized) on FB and SPY calls  P.S.

I will start with the good stuff:  * Delivery business, explosive growth in the coronavirus world * In China, where everything grows or goes to shit at 10x speed * Explosive top and bottom line growth over the last few years * Way higher margins AND faster growing than competitors (Look at [this](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZTO?p=ZTO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) compared to [SF Express](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/002352.SZ?p=002352.SZ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), [STO Express](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/002468.SZ?p=002468.SZ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), and [YTO Express](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600233.SS?p=600233.SS&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) * 10% owned by Alibaba partnership * [This fucking chart](https://robintrack.net/symbol/ZTO)  So it's a high growth, high margin, retail attracting logistics company in China with options pricing that isn't terrible (check the IV/RV chart [here](https://www.optionseducation.org/toolsoptionquotes/historical-and-implied-volatility)). Perfect.  Why now?  * Look at the fucking chart * Earnings tomorrow evening * Cheap compared to competitors after factoring in growth  As for the real world stuff, apparently their advantage is that they ship everywhere. The rural places in China get shafted by the other services. ZTO charges more for all routes, but have significantly better coverage than the competitors. Unfortunately that is the extent of my practical knowledge about that. Information courtesy of a distributor friend based in HK.  Clearly I FOMO'd my ass into this. Here come the risks.  * Accounting fraud -&gt; Turns out this is another Luckin * Neutral/Bad earnings -&gt; This is basically a coin toss. TBH in line is okay, but seems bad miss is unlikely in this environment. * Trump actually bans Chinese equities in the US -&gt; I am fucked, you are fucked, everyone is fucked  Seems legit.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1206504.0|public|confidence|self|Coronastock of coronastocks|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn6eyn/coronastock_of_coronastocks/|all_ads|6.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '16jxFHXnGLmDKC4M3Q9uMUZyOARBNVxPEqecC4TMIC0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f365f35593a8ff5a4345f6ac61b70cfef15e52', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db450c618f53c6c33778e43b211fad788e7e62a', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3493dedbabed68d15d63888f37945dedec7d2af', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 500, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=09218c9750baa74ba3af4f892ae6b67e30677927', 'width': 500}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2020-05-20|EXPR

Including questionable longs like AMC and Hertz.  &amp;#x200B;  May 16, 2020 10:15 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News       The latest round of [13F        filings](https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/16/07/8248359/terms-of-the-trade-13f-filings) from institutional investors is out, revealing to the world        the stocks that some of the richest and most successful investors have        been buying and selling.       ### Takeaways From 13F Season   Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what        each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be        more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of        2020 was the worst first quarter in the history of the S&amp;P 500, so        investors were particularly interested in how top investors played the        dip.       &amp;#x200B;  * Fund managers were dumping FANG stocks in the first quarter with a          handful of exceptions. Tepper bought Netflix and Cooperman bought          Facebook        * Alphabet was one stock several fund managers were selling in the          quarter. Tepper, Cooperman and Soros all reduced their holdings.        * Einhorn and Ackman both bought Berkshire, while Buffett himself was          buying PNC Financial and little else.        * Bank stocks were popular among fund managers in the first quarter          after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0%. Einhorn bought          Goldman Sachs, Cooperman bought JPMorgan and sold Citigroup and Wells          Fargo, Buffett sold Goldman Sachs, and Soros sold Bank of America,          Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.        * Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes.          Rosenstein and Smith sold the SPY ETF, while Soros bought municipal          bond and investment-grade corporate bond ETFs.         Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most        popular stocks last quarter.       *See Also:* [*'I        Was Wrong': Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Sold $6B Of Airline        Stock In April*](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/05/15940613/i-was-wrong-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-sold-6b-of-airline-stock-in-april)   ### David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital   Notable Q1 Buys/Increases:       &amp;#x200B;

(SLS) is a late-stage clinical  biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer  immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications with TWO Phase 3  ready cancer vaccines : GPS and NPS. Both have proven to be safe and  well-tolerated and achieved very impressive results so far. Impressive  list of partners funding the ongoing trials.  GPS :  • 	In February 2020, SELLAS announced positive follow-up data from its  Phase 1/2 study of GPS in CR2 AML patients. The final data show a median  overall survival (OS) of 21.0 months, at a median follow-up of 30.8  months, in patients receiving GPS compared to 5.4 months in patients  treated with best standard care (p-value &lt; 0.02). GPS therapy  continued to be well-tolerated throughout the study.  • 	In February 2020, SELLAS announced the enrollment of the first patient  in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of GPS in combination with  Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (Opdivo®), in  patients with MPM.  •	In January  2020, SELLAS announced that it commenced patient screening for its  pivotal Phase 3 REGAL study of GPS in patients with AML in CR2.  NPS :  • 	In March 2020, SELLAS announced preliminary antigen-specific immune  response data from a Phase 2 randomized investigator-sponsored trial of  NPS in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  (GM-CSF) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast  who are HLA-A2+ or A3+ positive, express HER2 at IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+  levels, and are pre- or post-menopausal. Preliminary data show an  11-fold increase in a CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes immune response in  patients who received a single dose of NPS compared to baseline. The  final data is being further analyzed by the National Institute of  Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the study principal investigator,  Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, MD, PhD of the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s  Cancer Center, and will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.  • 	In March 2020, SELLAS announced that final results from the efficacy  and safety data analysis of the Phase 2b independent  investigator-sponsored clinical trial of the combination of trastuzumab  (Herceptin®) +/- NPS targeting HER2 low-expressing breast cancer patient  cohorts, including patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),  were recently published in the peer reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer  Research. With regard to the TNBC patient cohort, the data analysis  shows:  \-  Disease-free survival  (DFS) landmark rate at 24 months for patients treated with NPS plus  trastuzumab (n=53) was 92.6% compared to 70.2% for those treated with  trastuzumab alone (n=44), a clinically and statistically significant  improvement.  \-  There was a  statistically significant reduction of 71.9% (p=0.01) in the frequency  of clinically detected recurrences in patients treated with the  combination (NPS plus trastuzumab) versus trastuzumab alone.  \-  The combination was generally well-tolerated and there were no clinicopathologic differences between the study groups.  • 	In February 2020, SELLAS announced that it had finalized the design and  plan for a Phase 3 registration-enabling study of NPS in combination  with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with TNBC in the adjuvant  setting after standard treatment, following feedback from a Type C  review with the FDA. SELLAS is actively pursuing out-licensing  opportunities to fund and conduct the future clinical development of  NPS.

It's still under the radar, but won't be for very long.     I went Friday to look at a gun, a model I've been putting off for a rainy day. Well, as soon as I got to Academy, I saw the counter was packed. A lot of their inventory was gone, and almost all the ammo. They said orders were being delayed by two weeks. So I went to two local gun shops a couple miles away. Both packed. The energy in these places were palpable. You could tell the owners &amp; employees were swamped. They kept saying this was the craziest they've ever seen it, in different ways, every place I went. So I perused 5 local shops total, and 3 big retailers between Friday and Saturday: Academy, Sportsman W-house, Bass Pro. I finally got the one I was looking for, but half the reason I kept looking was to see if everywhere was the same thing. Biggest surprise.. ammo. Every single place was low on ammo. Most ar rifles were gone, saw a lot of people buying pistols. But I kid you not, every single one of the EIGHT places had the same exhausted story from the guys behind the glass. Academy and Bass both said they were giving two-week timeframes for backorder. And a story I heard in one of the local shops, a guy said he just got back from TX where the stores were being bought up, but didn't think it would be like that here.     Of course I was thinking of RGR stock, as they're really the only pure play right now on just firearms.  So I got home and started looking for stories across the country, in local stations about gun stores.. and found these, among others:     https://dailygazette.com/article/2020/03/21/local-gun-sales-soar-as-virus-fears-mount  https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/world-news/in-pics-americans-are-panic-buying-guns/16/03/ &lt;-----Twitter Posts From Everywhere  https://indyeastend.com/news-opinion/covid-19/covid-19-spikes-gun-sales/  https://www.enterprisenews.com/news/20200322/middleboro-lakeville-stores-gun-ammo-sales-soar-amid-coronavirus-crisis  https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/local/story/2020/mar/23/outbreak-drives-increased-firearm-ammo-sales/821741/  https://44news.wevv.com/nationwide-run-guns-amid-coronavirus-stock/  https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/03/18/purchases-firearms-ammo-surge-amid-covid-19-fears/2865796001/     ALSO, the online sports retailers and online independent gunshops are showing sold out of almost all their inventory, especially rifles. Along with 'delay' banners across most of their sites.  And this:  https://imgur.com/a/fXUbo3Q  https://imgur.com/a/JkHTM4u     It's real, it's national and it's perhaps the biggest buying trend outside of toilet paper, only no one realizes it's happening yet. And the trend is going to have serious lasting power. Ruger is not only good quality for a decent price, but it's one of the most popular guns for first time buyers. Perfect for this specific environment, new buyers and people who just want stuff that works. They have the best capacity for ramping up production, compared to other smaller manufacturers. If stores need to order, they know they can order Ruger. It's also the only pureplay. S&amp;W got acquired by AOBC, and there are no other liquid instruments to express with, adding to the possible bottleneck of speculators into RGR. Very importantly, Ruger has no debt. They are well equity capitalized. They fit the perfect profile for a stock that can withstand a shock in which more indebted companies are having trouble right now. They're one of the only and perhaps from what I've seen with my own eyes, the most.. positively exposed product company for experiencing a windfall in revenue right now, and for the foreseeable months ahead.     Not only was this quarter a blowout, but the guidance going for Q2 is extremely elevated and in-turn, the 2020 yearly outlook as well. Try finding that kind of concentrated sales growth with already established gross and net margins on a non-debt balance sheet anywhere in the market right now. Nearly impossible. Most those other thematic trades don't have this kind of real world, concentrated healthy outlook, and actually make profit doing so.       Another thing to keep in mind, it's not a component of the S&amp;P index, giving it more freedom to vary from SPY.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1190840.0|public|confidence|self|The case for RGR.. the Covid-19 TSLA?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giiki5/the_case_for_rgr_the_covid19_tsla/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-05-12|EXPR

Now that we’re starting to reopen brick and mortar across the nation and the first news of second wave is finally starting to emerge across Europe and Asia, I’m finally confident enough to release my research.   Express Inc. the store you always walked by in the mall that triggered PTSD of a time you were able to get into a slim fit v neck and slug Red Bull vodkas down while listening to DJ Paully D. I think it’s finally time to put the nail in this one.   Sales: We’re all smart enough to see the writing on the wall. With 300+ stores closed across the nation, the primary driver of sales for Express has been decimated (similar to all retail chains who’s primary focus are not online). Second wave will be touch and go around states causing uncertainty in projected sales as foot traffic will be uncertain as states continue to figure out their return to normal. With the kind of clothing they sell, most people try before they buy, this could also increase cost of inventory for constantly having to sanitize products in store, or increase inventory costs from constant back and forth from online returns.  Secondly, let’s look at the target market for Express clothes. Their product is mainly focused around businesses and casual wear. Considering there’s a large movement towards WFH, I don’t see many people buying dress shirts, pants etc. On the casual side, bars and restaurants will be the last to open. As less people will be dressing for a night out, I see another major dent in sales.   Express have turned to online sales to generate revenue. However, they’re a discretionary product. They state in the risks portion of the 10-K they’re facing heavy competition from online retailers and lower priced product (like an H&amp;M). Substitute goods.  Also, net sales have been flat or going down since 2015.  Product: Express relies 100% on manufacturing from both Asia and South America. This means that they could face major supply interruptions as COVID starts to spread in South America and continues to persist in Asia. To top this, Express’ distribution, manufacturing and shipping are 100% outsourced. You may think well, less overhead, which is a fair point, but to be at the mercy of the supply chain may result in reputation damage and lost sales.   There’s a fair bit more on their product side exposure if you have a look at the 10-K.  Assets: As the company leases most store space, it doesn’t have hard assets like brick and mortar to sell off and raise cash.  60% of its total assets are a “Right of Use Asset” which funnily just popped up on the Balance Sheet this year and is a lessees right to use an asset over the life of the asset. Not much in the financials about what it is, but I’m calling BS on that having much value when brick and mortar isn’t attractive and no business are looking to pick up leases. Get ready for that to be impaired into the ground.  Other assets are small cash and clothes ... which lord only knows who’s buying a 60 dollar button down with 30M unemployed.   Liabilities: Obviously major liability is leases which ST is about equal to all their ST assets. Sure they’ll manage to negotiate, but again, that costs money. Also long term lease liabilities, which oh funny enough is the same amount as the Right of Use Asset. So they’re balance sheet less that one accounting for leases is 800M half of which is going to ST liabilities.  Stock Price: Okay I’m getting tired but I think we’re starting to get the point. It’s been going down like your girlfriend for the past 5 years. In one of their recent disclosures they issued preferred shares, which I think means further dilution.   The CEO in the 8-k filed recently mentioned they’re furloughed employees and trying to reduce expenses, but let’s be real, they were headed to penny stock land or bankruptcy long before COVID. This is just the last nail in the coffin.  Earnings for Q2 are going to be terrible, which surely in the limbo stick analyst world will screw me short term as “it wasn’t as bad as expected” is apparently a new acceptable normal. I’m a believer this one is done long term, even if the second wave isn’t as bad as I predict.  Options noob, but I can’t short. Do your own research, this is NOT investment advice.

(NYSE: SPCE) (“Virgin Galactic” or “the Company”) and The Spaceship Company (“TSC”) today announced the successful completion of its first SpaceShipTwo test flight from Spaceport America.  This glide flight marks the inaugural solo flight of VSS Unity in New Mexico and as such is an important flight test milestone in preparation for commercial service.  On SpaceShipTwo’s flight deck were Dave Mackay and CJ Sturckow who, together with the team in Mission Control, executed some of the key elements of a spaceflight profile. These included take-off and landing along with high-altitude release from the mothership, VMS Eve, which was piloted by Michael Masucci and Kelly Latimer.  The flight took off from the Spaceport America runway, with VSS Unity attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve. The vehicles climbed to an altitude of 50,000ft before Unity was released, at which point VSS Unity flew freely for the first time in New Mexico airspace. The spaceship achieved a glide speed of Mach 0.70 and completed multiple test-points, before touching back down smoothly for a runway landing at Spaceport America.  This test flight was conducted under a set of stringent operational protocols to ensure safety against COVID-19. Its successful execution was made possible by a concerted effort to redesign all the operational elements required for safe flight test while meeting new health and wellness protocols. These protocols include changes to the work areas and procedures to enforce social distancing as advised by state guidelines as well as universal mask usage.  This flight milestone represents a major achievement which has been in the planning since SpaceShipTwo relocated to Virgin Galactic’s New Mexico commercial headquarters in February. Virgin Galactic also fully concluded the relocation of its spaceline operations team and their families to New Mexico.  This glide flight provided the first opportunity to test all the components required to fly the carrier aircraft and spaceship in glide configuration, from a new home base and in new airspace. Dave and CJ performed a series of maneuvers with VSS Unity designed to gather data about performance and handling qualities in order to enhance our aerodynamic modeling and verify against similar maneuvers that were performed earlier in Unity’s test flight program. The flight test also provided an opportunity for the pilots and spaceflight operations team to continue familiarisation with the new airspace around the Gateway to Space and a chance to capture valuable in-flight data and conduct further pilot training.  Friday’s flight successfully completed all test objectives. Virgin Galactic would like to express its thanks to New Mexico Spaceport Authority (NMSA), the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Albuquerque Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and the FAA Air Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque for smooth coordination and efficient integration.  Preparation for the next flight will now begin, starting with an in depth analysis of today’s flight data.  George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company said, “I’d like to congratulate our team for reaching this flight milestone, especially during these challenging times. I am grateful for the commitment displayed by everyone involved, not only in helping to support relief efforts in both New Mexico and California, but also for the dedication and creativity which will allow us to continue safely towards our goal of commercial launch.”  “Today’s VSS Unity flight is another exciting milestone for Virgin Galactic's progress in New Mexico. We are extremely happy and proud of Virgin Galactic, not only for today’s success but also for the exceptional way they have integrated into NM and supported the region and State during this stressful time dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.  # **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)** ***** &gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies. ***** &gt; It’s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald’s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results. ***** &gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down. ***** &gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia’s plan to reopen. ***** &gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week. ***** &gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%. ***** &gt; “If you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it’s a fundamental story,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “The fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.” ***** &gt; Golub said it’s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that’s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. “People are watching what’s going on in places like Georgia, but they’re also watching what’s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,” he said. “At the end of the day, there’s really one thing that really matters. It’s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.” ***** &gt; # Fed bazooka &gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it’s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity. ***** &gt; “I’m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “I think we’re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what’s working and the things that still need to happen.” ***** &gt; Tilley said the Fed’s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. “It looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they’ve come back in,” he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program. ***** &gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank’s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%. ***** &gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn’t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed. ***** &gt; “The Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they’re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,” he said. “Whether you’re borrowing from a bank or whether you’re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.” ***** &gt; # Economic impact &gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%. ***** &gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production. ***** &gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday’s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits. ***** &gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off. ***** &gt; “We’ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,” Tilley said. ***** &gt; # Earnings &gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important. ***** &gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures. ***** &gt; “The most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It’s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,” said Golub. “My estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it’s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that’s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.” ***** &gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. “We had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that’s really bad.” Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**  *****  # Election-year Mays: DJIA’s Second Worst Month  &gt; May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.  &gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.  &gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**  *****  # LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective  &gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We’ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we’ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.  &gt; “We recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.”  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling  &gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we’ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?  &gt; “This remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When we’ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.”  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020  &gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy has performed so far this year.  &gt; The ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.  &gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.  &gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**  *****  # Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far  &gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.  &gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators  &gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed’s National Activity index started off the week coming in at –4.19 which was well below estimates of –3. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**  &gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell’s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**  *****  # Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)  &gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.  &gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening.

For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.  &gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$AMZN**  &gt; * **$TSLA**  &gt; * **$MSFT**  &gt; * **$AAPL**  &gt; * **$AMD**  &gt; * **$BA**  &gt; * **$FB**  &gt; * **$LUV**  &gt; * **$MMM**  &gt; * **$GE**  &gt; * **$AAL**  &gt; * **$UPS**  &gt; * **$TWTR**  &gt; * **$PFE**  &gt; * **$CBSH**  &gt; * **$PEP**  &gt; * **$MA**  &gt; * **$GOOGL**  &gt; * **$GILD**  &gt; * **$SBUX**  &gt; * **$UAL**  &gt; * **$V**  &gt; * **$SPOT**  &gt; * **$MCD**  &gt; * **$XOM**  &gt; * **$F**  &gt; * **$CAT**  &gt; * **$TDOC**  &gt; * **$AMAT**  &gt; * **$AWI**  &gt; * **$CHKP**  &gt; * **$MRK**  &gt; * **$ABBV**  &gt; * **$WHR**  &gt; * **$QCOM**  &gt; * **$BP**  &gt; * **$KHC**  &gt; * **$CLX**  &gt; * **$HAS**  &gt; * **$ANTM**  &gt; * **$NOK**  &gt; * **$CMS**  &gt; * **$CNX**  &gt; * **$APRN**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))   &gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))   *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Amazon.com, Inc. - &gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Stop bearing a retarded bear and smarten up.  Large funds have ""risk on"" positions (stocks, credit) and ""risk off"" positions (treasuries, gold). When a large money manager gets bearish they usually don't just go short because that's usually a dumb idea, instead they go long Treasuries and if rates are artificially low because of the Fed they will buy gold. Look at the portfolio in the image (50% Gold, 50% 30 year treasuries) and you can see how it generally does well during market turmoil, but doesn't get crushed during market recoveries.  Instead of just buying puts on SPY and getting crushed by Theta, express part of your bearishness by writing put spreads on TLT and GLD, and or going long vertical call spreads.

Why first ? I’m posting because I’ve seen some retarded DD on here last 2 days that would offend retarded people.   Why Last ? I got better things to do.   My credentials ?  Insider in this space for over 10 years.    ( excuse the grammars. English is my fourth language).   This is a very dumbed down version as I can’t very well write 100 pages on wsb post.  There are books, seminars, certifications on this stuffs.   Credit Card processing is very important as it’s a key indicator for consumers spending.   Scroll down for  Puts/Calls.  **Parties Involved to make it work ?**  1.) Consumer   --- end user. Credit Card holder.   2.) Merchant   --- Business establishment accepting  payment. These guys pay out all the fees  3.) Card Brand   ---- Visa, Mastercard, Discover (Diner Club,  Union Pay), American Express,   4.) Sponsoring Bank   --- handles risks, daily balancing, funding the merchant.   5.) Issuing Bank --- Issue the credit card. If your credit card say “ Chase”, then Chase is the issuing bank.   6.) Processor  --- transactions run through these guys. Think of them as a highway to run  and verify transactions  7.) ISO --- Independent sales office. These guys are the one who call business to sign them up with “ use my company     for cheaper rates”   **How**  **does each Parties make money ?**   1.) Consumer --- they don’t  anything as they are the purchaser.  2.) Merchant --- they pay out all the fees. At the end of the month, they get a bill for the privilege of being able to accept credit card.    3.) Card Brand --- Card Brand is pretty much god. They make about 15% of total fees paid out to merchant.   Look up  FANF, dues &amp; assessments. If Visa need money, they just increase their rates, that’s it. More on this later.   4.) Sponsoring Bank -- these guys make the least out of everyone in the group. About  0.01% -0.03%  ( 1 to 3 BP) of total processing volume.    5.) Issuing bank -- “interchange” is paid out to the issuing bank. These fees account for about 75% of all total fees.  Card Brand dictate interchange. I’m not going to go into qualifications, etc….. Interchange rates is publish for each card brand. Look it up.   6.) Processor --- these guys usually make money on per transaction counts. About $0.02 -$0.05 per transaction and bunch of other misc fees.   7.) ISO --- whatever is left over goes to the sales group.  In a normal business niche ( not high risk or CBD/ cannabis), profit is about 0.30% - 0.50% of total processing volume.   **Profit Math**  Merchant’s fee – ( issuing bank + card brand ) = ISO’ Gross - ( Processor + Sponsoring Bank) = ISO’s Net.     **Fees:**   Always have 2 parts.     a.)  Percentage  multiply by the processing volume.   b.)  Fix charge multiply by the transaction.  What if you as a sales office  charged merchant 2.75% ( SQUARE) and  nothing else? you would  net negative on any transactions under $10 and  net positive on any transaction over $40.00  Why ? because interchange for a signature regulated debit is  0.05%+ $0.22( per transaction) not including all the other costs.   **State of the world.**  All 50 states have stay-at-home orders. Some states are talking about opening up again ( GA, FL).  Guess what ? it’s the Consumers who’s going to decide when to “open” up. Household spending account for 70% of annual GDP.   The rest of the world is on lock down. Even after opening up, it’s still bad.   [https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793)  **Great……**  **Give me puts or calls……………..**  1.) Card Brand   ----   a. Visa ( V)  -- earning is on 04/30. They are  the god in this business. They have the greatest exposure in US and overseas. There is no place in asia or Europe that does not take Visa. They increase their rates twice a year. Rate increases scheduled for this April was pushed back to July.  Their earnings will be absolutely horrible as the rest of the world started shutting down in Feb and US in march.   i.  Waiting to be fill --- V 01 May $160P    ii. Waiting to be fill --- V 19 June $135P   b. Mastercard -- earning is on 04/29 -- They have the second highest processing in US. Also like Visa. If you are playing earning, any puts within 5% will be good.   c. Discover ( DFS)  (Diner Club,  Union Pay) --- Earning  4/22 -- I had  15 X $2.72 01 May $34C going into earning. CALLS?? WTF?? 1.) they announced dividends right before earnings. 2.) They own debit networks. Think grocery stores, liquor stores, cannabis shops. 3.) Dinner club, union pay, paypal all goes through them to process on a traditional level.   Results:   Q1 GAAP EPS of -$0.25 misses by $1.61.  Revenue of $2.89B (+4.7% Y/Y) beats by $10M.  Shares -5.3% AH.  Going to exit my position at open with probably 40% losses.   This is good, if  DFS  missed by bad, the rest will be way way worst.   d. American Express ( AXP) ---  rich people’s credit card.   2.) Sponsoring Bank   ---  a. FITB -- 4/21 --  missed earning. Went down on 4/21 then went back up.   📷  3.) Issuing Bank --- I would not touch issuing bank as they are too diversified.  a. Chase  b. Bank of America  4.) Processor  -- do your own research.    a. Global Payments  b. Fiserv  **Other:**   SQ ( Square) -- earning 05/06. I did not talked about Payment facilitator. Which is kinda of what they are.   Here was a post on here  “ Square InC, SQ Puts—let’s be rational. Right direction but wrong DD.   Square  is all domestic and make their money primary from   1.)  Credit Card processing --- they will give merchant, 2.75% or $275 total fees. Their credit card processing  is net negative since inception. The reason is because of their client base ( mom and pop, start up, small transactions type businesses). 2.75% is a good percentage on volume but the $0.00 per swipe is killing them by the time they have to pay out interchanges  and dues assessments.  Their average ticket have to be over $25.00 to be profit. But the business model will not allow it. Small mom and pop go to them because lax underwriting,  and it’s a lot easier vs a traditional model. Most of their merchants is under 10k in processing.   2.) Hardware sales  --- very minimal 1 time revenue   3.) SAS ( Service as a subscription) -- Minimal revenue when comparing to credit card processing. They are also waiving all the software subscription fees for the month of April.   4.) Others…………  **I WOULD NOT TOUCH SQUARE.**   1.)  In fintech, you don’t need to be making money. You can have years of losses and stock will go up. Why ? because it’s about acquiring a large merchant base.   2.) Jack Dorsey -- yes the Twitter guy. He’s the founder and ceo of Square. He’s the Elon Musk of this  space. And you don’t mess with papa  Elon.   3.)  SQ is  APPROVED to make Emergency Small-Business Coronavirus loans.

We’ll end up in a quarantine again then puts till January.     So oil has been quite fucky recently going negative and all that shit. So we gonna make some BIG bucks by exploiting that shit. Probably might accidently break a few laws if we go through with all this, but FUCK it cause I gotta make some money back.  Alright so what we need to do is corral a few willing participants to get this started and pool some money together. Probably not a bunch but a decent bit, cause loans exist. First we’re gonna need to find a homeless person, preferably one with a drug addiction so they’ll be easier to pay off, for this we’re going to call him Joe  So we take Joe and we get him to set up a cooperation. We can call it whatever we want, but this is going to act as a holding company for an LLC. Also where we can issue shares if need be.  Joe is going to appoint some of us lucky few as a member of the board where we establish a hold on the company. Joe gets a 15% stake for his troubles, a nice hotel room until all this is over, the drug of his choice if he would like, and a few escorts if he fancies those. All paid for buy our company credit card, of course, courtesy of American Express (I can hook him up with escorts that take credit cards for some reward points). We then divvy up the remaining 36% to whomever we decide to appoint to the board, for a total of a controlling share of 51%. We leave the remaining 49% available to outside investors. We issue 1,000,000,000 shares at $0.01 a share.  So then we take the rest of us and form the LLC, again name it whatever cause it wont matter later on.  Make all of us the co-owners and what not. We all get an equal share yada-yada, ya.  So this is where we’re going to acquire all our shit. Eventually we get acquired by the corporation thus upping their share value.  ALRIGHT so what we do is we buy this piece of land and negative money oil https://buyalabamaland.com/listings/01-004-mccluney-cave/ OR if any of you grand autismos can find land for sale with a salt dome under it, it’ll be a lot easier. Why Alabama? Because no-one important will think this is happening in Alabama. We can just say we’re looking for more niter if push comes to shove. I’ve lived there, lots of idiots and we more than likely won’t get ratted out if we give money to the churches. Short explanation: We go in the cave, get to the end of it and blow a hole in that bitch. Then, we drill another hole and pump our crude oil back into the ground (yes it’s possible) for later use. If we find a salt dome it’ll be a lot easier. I know some peeps and if I need to know some more peeps I can arrange it to get the work done.  So basically, what we do is buy cheap oil and pump the oil back into the ground, Corporation acquires LLC, everyone gets stock, oil goes up, value of shares go up, we buy out Joe, and we then sell the cooperation to someone else and get out our sell the majority of our shares and lose control of the company.  This is just a quick little scribble down, but the big details can be worked out over time|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1130338.0|public|confidence|self|So who wants to go all in?|0.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5xhaq/so_who_wants_to_go_all_in/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-04-22|EXPR

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.  # **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)** ***** &gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy. ***** &gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners. ***** &gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows. ***** &gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks. ***** &gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%. ***** &gt; “As the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. “The data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.” As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back. ***** &gt; Charts are important &gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers. ***** &gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday’s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum. ***** &gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen’s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point. ***** &gt; “My [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there’s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,” he said. “I’m not sure we’re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It’s been awesome.” ***** &gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday. ***** &gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. “The market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,” he said. “They’ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.” ***** &gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely. ***** &gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed’s quantitative easing programs. “We’re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,” he said. ***** &gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. “Part of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that’s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,” said Doll. ***** &gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important. ***** &gt; “Its going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,” he said, “This one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that’s defensive in nature is going to perform well.” ***** &gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy’s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different. ***** &gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research. ***** &gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period. ***** &gt; “I think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,” said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal. ***** &gt; “They won’t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,” he said, “I think that window will close, and we’ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there’s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.” ***** &gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices. ***** &gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002.

The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract. ***** &gt; “It’s just a reflection of physical market conditions,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**  *****  # How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu  &gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).  &gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.  &gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**  &gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**  *****  # Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term  &gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**  &gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**  &gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**  &gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**  *****  # It’s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)  &gt; It’s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn’t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.  &gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn’t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn’t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won’t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**  *****  # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish  &gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 “Best Six Months,” has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA’s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.  &gt; April’s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$NFLX**  &gt; * **$DAL**  &gt; * **$KO**  &gt; * **$INFY**  &gt; * **$HAL**  &gt; * **$LMT**  &gt; * **$ALLY**  &gt; * **$SNAP**  &gt; * **$T**  &gt; * **$DPZ**  &gt; * **$IBM**  &gt; * **$PM**  &gt; * **$INTC**  &gt; * **$LUV**  &gt; * **$CMG**  &gt; * **$BIIB**  &gt; * **$HCA**  &gt; * **$VZ**  &gt; * **$BOH**  &gt; * **$MTB**  &gt; * **$ONB**  &gt; * **$SAP**  &gt; * **$BMRC**  &gt; * **$CMA**  &gt; * **$PHG**  &gt; * **$AXP**  &gt; * **$ERIC**  &gt; * **$CBU**  &gt; * **$KMB**  &gt; * **$TFC**  &gt; * **$PLD**  &gt; * **$SYF**  &gt; * **$NEE**  &gt; * **$LII**  &gt; * **$NDAQ**  &gt; * **$LLY**  &gt; * **$SNA**  &gt; * **$LVS**  &gt; * **$TRV**  &gt; * **$LRCX**  &gt; * **$KALU**  &gt; * **$EMR**  &gt; * **$CIT**  &gt; * **$FITB**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))   &gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))   *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Netflix, Inc. $422.96 &gt; **Netflix, Inc.

The research project has been led by the ECB and its brr brr brr printer located in Frankfurth.  *TLDR: The foundation of the banking system is softer than my pee pee when my wife's bf  comes on his Friday night visits.*  We all know about Jpow and madame Lagarde's brrr brrr brrr bukaki fest going on lately, but this is just the grand final of what i believe could challenge the banks basics of existence.  **Some background**  The shit show began in June of 2014 when the ECB introduced negative rates of -0.1 to stimulate growth in the region, fast forward to September of 2019 couple months before the ol' ro ro outbreak, rates where cut to -0,5 in a desperate attempt to win the Paralympic gold medal for financial irresponsibility. With the banks in uncharted territory around the  union they had to adapt. On one hand lower rates = more loans, more mortgage refinancing etc. = gr8 fOr biZz. On the other hand, due to the banks risky behavior from 08 and general bad pr and distrust in the public they were handcuffed by most European governments demanding them to increase their capital requirements, take less risk and an ever evolving and expensive KYC/AML procedure.  After all the rate cutting and increased expenses, the banks margins grew tighter and tighter. In fighting for survival the banks had to react, first off they implemented negative interest rates on corporate deposits with household deposits still remaining in the positive. At this point a mayor revenue stream for the banks was gone, as they historically always made money from household deposits, all of a sudden this was no longer the case.  No bank works for free and they would suck every last drop of blood if they could but they had to stay competitive with each other as well as acting the role of the responsible parent in the eyes of the public. So what was the next step?  Jyske Bank in mid 2019, the 3rd largest bank in my beautiful country of Denmark was the first bank in the world to introduce a -0,5% mortgage rate. Yep you heard that right, Jyske Bank pays customers 0.5% pr. year to take on a mortgage. You might think to yourself, daaaamn i wish i had such nice bankers in my country, but hold up. The next step Jyske Bank would take lifted the eyebrows of every autist  with a brain cell.  Jyske Bank went negative on household deposits. All of our lives we were told to save for the future, to be financially responsible, Jyske Bank took that philosophy and pissed on it. I mean a good old dark, yellow, stinky, hangover morning piss. At first it was exclusive for high net worth clients having at least the equivalent of 1 milly USD, but the requirements quickly lowered and all other mayor Danish banks followed suit.  As of today it will cost private households deposits -0,75% pr. year if you own more than roughly 35K USD. Yup you read that right, we have to pay the banks to gamble with our money!  **What now?**  Even before the Rona i think negative rates on every household deposit in every European bank were coming now it is inevitable and i don't see a way around it in great Muuurica as well.  After reading through reports on the National bank of Denmark, they express concern with what they call ""reverse rate"", this basically means that there is a point where lowering the rate through monetary policy further into the negative would have a reverse effect and banks would increase their rates to borrowers and growth would stall. In other words, they are running out of ammo. I know Japan has been running this scheme for decades but it is just not sustainable for the entire European union and possibly the states all at the same time.  **Total disaster**  My fear and doomsday scenario goes as follows:  Good credit and less risk is very subjective terms in banking. Every fucker with a paycheck applied to all the negative and near zero % mortgage loans in Denmark and around Europe and of course the banks have lend out more lightly than they should. All off the banks are now tied up on long term mortgages making peanuts with margins tighter than ever meanwhile governments are pushing for lowering  rates on risky business loans even further due to the credit crunch going around the world atm.  On top of that we are in a situation where unemployment is skyrocketing allover the place, supply and demand chains are shutting down,  consumer confidence must be at an all time low, what does this lead to?  From a game theoretical perspective the most logical thing for people to do when this thing drags out is to do a historical bank run. People will flood the banks asking for physical cash withdrawals to avoid paying negative rates on their deposits in times of uncertainty  and distrust, the banks cash requirements are non existent and most central bank liquidity is just numbers on a screen, no bills. This leads to a solvency crisis, 1930's 2.0. The Danish national bank even discussed the issue in one of its reports but pushed it aside with the argument that lager physical amounts of cash is a hassle to store, the public will not give a flying fuck when they see their fortune vanish and it is time to put food on the table.  This could possibly lead a total collapse of the banking system in the western world, banks did not have a reason to exist with negative interest rates before the Rona, now it is even more evident. No brrrr can make up for distrust and panic in the public, only push it further.  &amp;#x200B;  **How to go about it**  Long gold, silver, physical cash and any other asset that has a limited supply, is durable, portable, divisible  and impossible to counterfeit.   &amp;#x200B;  What are your thoughts?"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1101066.0|public|confidence|self|Banking collapse?|0.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0v2l3/banking_collapse/|no_ads|0.0||||||1586867199.0|||||||||||||||||2020-04-14|EXPR

Today we are going to go across the pond to analyze LIBOR, one of the most important aspects of the lending market.  **Daddy Powell, Going Where Even Our Princess Janet Yellen Would Never Have Gone:**  The Fed this morning announced a massive unloading of additional stimulus, and one of the most significant additions they are now including: providing liquidity to parts of the High Yield (junk) Corporate Bond Market. This is big, very big. For one, I never thought this move would occur because traditional QE has focused on agency and government backed securities. The role of liquidity being considered for IG and HY markets misconfigures market pricing of counterparty risk. Just as Janet's pristine grey hair is getting greyer because of Powell, so too am I shitting bricks. We are living in Powell's monetary simulation, his own little Matrix.  **This is today's dissertation: where do we look in this market to understand real(ish) credit risk.**    Lending is the foundation of economic output, and understanding the pricing behind lending, that is, properly calculating counterparty risk, is of paramount importance. For instance, your wife's boyfriend wants to borrow money to buy a Rolie despite being a savant of McDonald burger flipping - you ain't getting that money back. Your wife's boyfriend (the counterparty) carries counterparty risk (if he doesn't pay you back). Note: I am talking monetary compensation not sexual favors. Anyway, at a high level, we have historically been able to look at Investment Grade and/or High Yield option adjusted spreads (OAS) for understanding what the market is pricing in as a default risk. These spreads tell us the spread between a given rating category in relation to the respective spot treasury curve. Put in WSB lingo: It shows us the market priced default risk / credit risk within the corporate bond market relative to a related treasury security. Put even more simply: higher OAS spreads, greater risk. It serves as an adequate way for the market to express distress, concern, and future risk/volatility. Put in the purest of forms: spread go uppie, expected risk go uppie!   We saw during the March liquidity crunch OAS spreads widen substantially, and they have recently been contracting substantially. In fact, proxies for performance can be found in ETFs, particularly LQD (IG Corporates) and HYG (HY Corporates). Because of the Fed's announcement, HYG is on track for its best performance today in history. This isn't any significant breakthrough. It is the same concept in the MBS market, the Repo market, etc. Fed stimulus ""props up"" these markets by providing liquidity / access to capital that the free market normally would not provide - this suppresses yields below the theoretical free market equilibrium. Some shitfuck on CNBC even said earlier ""I may just buy what the Fed buys."" This suppresses yields, encourages risk taking, and inflates asset prices. **My perspective: The Fed moving into the IG and HY bond market will cause bond spreads over treasuries to be an inadequate representation of market default risk as OAS are likely to decline.**   **I Present LIBOR, One of the Final Places to Discover Pure(ish) Credit Risk**  LIBOR, in its simplest form, is  the average interest rate select banks on the London money market are prepared to lend to each other, without collateral. It is a rough estimate of what banks would charge other banks for money. This reference rate purely considers the supply and demand balance among member banks, and serves as an adequate representation for credit risk that banks are pricing in among each other. The interesting thing about LIBOR, is that it is consistently priced very closely to the Fed Funds Rate, which the Fed cut last month to the lower bound between 0.00%-0.25%. But, the interesting thing as of late is that while the Fed Funds Rate has dropped to an effective rate of 0.05%, current 3M LIBOR is priced at 1.31%. The Fed controls the Fed Funds Rate through short-term treasury securities, so the 3M Treasury Bill is an important proxy for the Fed Funds Rate in understanding this relationship.  The historical relationship between the 3M T-bill and LIBOR 3M is displayed below. The key takeaway: LIBOR is consistently priced a few basis points above the 3M T-bill, up until a big recent divergence.  https://preview.redd.it/3bu7zn948ur41.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c927ad4d84d7f4e7a6a237ce19259734ef6698  A better way to display this relationship is the TED Spread. This displays the spread between the 3M T-Bill and 3M LIBOR:  https://preview.redd.it/yeeknpwd8ur41.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79809efc66a85d3b68ce3f809c3b18e4bf45e1b1  During the 08' Financial Crisis, LIBOR surged higher in relation to the 3M T-Bill and effective Fed Funds Rate as the risk of literal bank defaults took hold (think Bear Sterns and Lehman). What we have seen in the past month, is that the spread has widened to its greatest level since the financial crisis.   LIBOR is critical for understanding the market risk considered by banks in lending markets. LIBOR is used as the index pricing base for bank loans (term loans, revolvers, you name it), as well as instrumental in pricing interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.   **Cool, So Why is this Important?**  LIBOR is one of the last places to identify credit risk that is not directly influenced by the Fed. The Fed liquidity distorts nearly every aspect of fixed income markets, and **monitoring where LIBOR moves in the coming weeks is going to be critical to understanding the underbelly of bank counterparty risk.** Currently, LIBOR has been trading at a significant premium to the equivalent 3M T-Bill. This implies that the bank market is digesting significant fear, and while LIBOR has decreased very slightly over the past two weeks (nothing compared to the IG / HY OAS), the movement has been slim, and higher than normal credit risk is still priced in.   **tl;dr - The Fed is causing typical proxies for credit market distress to be hidden because of added liquidity, and LIBOR is one of the few representations of market lending rates that the Fed cannot directly influence. The divergence between the 3M T-Bill and 3M LIBOR is very indicative of continued distress in the lending markets despite Fed's intervention.**   Below is additional reading:  LIBOR Forward Curve:  [LIBOR Forward Curve \(Chatham Financial\)](https://preview.redd.it/lfvx0oo2eur41.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac42394e0403fa2b31c876156bb1e80b1ae7d10a)  The LIBOR forward curve is the market's projection of future LIBOR expectations using Eurodollar futures and Swap data. The LIBOR curve is instrumental in pricing of interest rate swaps, but we are not going to go down that rabbit hole today.  The market's forward curve is currently anticipating a return to the relationship between the 3M T-Bill and 3M LIBOR around Q3/Q4 of 2020. That is, according to Fed Fund Futures, the market does not anticipate any rate hikes for the next year or two, but the market does anticipate that LIBOR will recede back to the traditional basis point spread. This is important because the futures market is saying they anticipate the current lending risks among banks are expected to relinquish later this year. This makes sense: if COVID goes away over the summer, economies reopen, and demand improves. Now, my challenge to you: Do you think that is adequate? Do you think that the market will be much better off and face less credit risk in 3-4 months from now? Reflect on that, and I will be following what LIBOR does closely moving forward, and I will keep you all updated.  My Rant:  My $0.02 - The Fed moving into non-agency/government securities represents a critical shift in modern monetary policy. The brrr machine will never stop pumping when shit hits the fan. This is going to kick deficit spending and the issue of inflated asset prices down the road until Fed power becomes obsolete. Pricing in ""credit risk"" is becoming more and more of a joke because what's the point of pricing in default risk if you're guaranteed a bailout or liquidity to access further capital? Let the business failures fail. It has better long-term economic benefits than propping up failing businesses. Sorry, I just needed to rant.

The market doesn’t even react to any news at this point. It just goes up. Technical Anal is hardly even applicable at this point, SPY goes up on no news, high volume, low volume, doesn’t matter. OPEC deal is priced in both ways, we’re out of the bear market, and analysts left and right keep yelling v shaped recovery. This is uncharted territory, this type of movement in the market has literally never happened, you can’t even look at 2008, 1987, or 1929 anymore. Honestly at this point just hop on the JPow printer express to SPY 300 and then join Drill Team 6 down to 220.

Things are not great. It has been in the hole to the tune of -$30-$100MM (NOT A FRICKIN TYPO!!) for 10+ days now.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Aside from being that deep in the hole, other tremendous things happening to it:  \- it has not been able to achieve exposure objectives on 3 of last, maybe, 15 trading days. thats coz it did not have the coin to buy the swaps it needed to do this. Deets at the end  \- fund management decided to change objective from 3\* to 2\* effective May 19th 2020. Then corona showed up and they decided to accelerate that to EOD March 31st 2020. But they remain in the red. Again, deets at the end.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Decided to track daily holdings on this thing to figure out when it would die starting about 2 weeks ago. Here is a summary of what they look like over that period with the 5 day Yahoo chart right under it.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  [https://i.imgur.com/QsAostk.png](https://i.imgur.com/QsAostk.png)     &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  See that red row at the bottom, thats holdings as of today.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  ¡¡¡¡THOSE NUMBERS MAKE NO SENSE!!!!  &amp;#x200B;  $DUST WENT DOWN 10% TODAY SWAP HOLDINGS GO U \~ $30MM.   &amp;#x200B;  THAT IS SOME CRAZY $&amp;@%  !!!!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  You are probably thinking, yeah, whatevs! You have no idea what you are talking about here.   &amp;#x200B;  OK, lets drill into this a little bit.  &amp;#x200B;  Here are holdings for the ETF categorized by type - Swaps, Treasuries and Cash for the same period  &amp;#x200B;  [https://i.imgur.com/D2unhqD.png](https://i.imgur.com/D2unhqD.png)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  That green column with the ""VANECK VECTORS GOLD MINERS ETF SWAP"" is where the funky stuff is happening.  Look at that last cell in darker green - $DUST goes down 10% and the swap gains 10%!!!! HOW?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  This swap, which is designed SOLELY AND ONLY for the purposes of paying out when $DUST goes down, GAINED ALMOST $30MM IN VALUE TODAY WHEN $DUST WENT DOWN 10%   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Just compare any daily chart since March 19th 2020 with the swap; when $DUST drops, the swap loses value the same ratio.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  It is simply not possible for the swap to go up when the ticker goes down. ITS' EXPRESS AND ONLY PURPOSE IS TO GO DOWN WHEN THE TICKER GOES DOWN! HOW DOES IT GAIN $30MM on 10% down day.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  And its not a payout (buyout??) of the swap with cash - there is a drop of \~ $15MM in cash which simply moved from BoNY to Dreyfus. Its not the treasuries either, only about \~$6MM of flows there, not enough to cover the $30MM  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpiuAqKDU\_8&amp;t=1m26s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpiuAqKDU_8&amp;t=1m26s)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  The ETF isn't shutting down!

The  SEC  said last week that it would extend the deadline (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-74) for companies to provide certain disclosure reports by 45 days, given business disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies requesting delays just have to provide a summary of why an extension is needed for each report, the  SEC  said. Read MarketWatch's Coronavirus update (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-803650-cases- 39033-deaths-and-white-house-expected-to-release-models-showing-trajectory-of-illness-2020-03-31). Some of the companies within the Dow Jones Industrial Average have already issued press releases stating when their earnings reports will be released. But as many companies have withdrawn financial guidance, given difficulties in assessing the potential impact of the coronavirus health crisis, they can still look to push back releasing those reports.

There are a few factors which could contribute to this.  1. Trump is proclaiming that the governor to White House relationship is a two way street. And they need to do something for him, setting up these tense exchanges and media war. If they openly express anger towards him, he may withhold aid.  2. All these hard hit areas are deep blue areas. NYC, Illinois, California. Cities, portrayed as the elite. Trump can and will withhold aid to these states based purely on politics and lack of loyalty to him. We are so divided we can’t even have the senate agree to a stimulus yet. It’s crazy how much we are over negotiating.  3. He will also falsely “order” the country back to work and proclaim the virus defeated when it is not. Leading to more anger and outrage.  4. The federal government response thus far has been  extremely lacking. While we’ve had people all over the country spreading in their communities, other countries are testing vigorously and chasing down clusters. We haven’t even thought of doing that. We will be much worse than any country we’ve seen so far. Worse than Italy. I’ll get to more of why that is.  5. NYC is extremely dense. The subways are packed each morning, flu season often strikes many people in an office at once, everyone is physically much closer to each other. The cases will peak more here than any other city. Unfortunately what I think will happen in NYC will make Italy look small. New York City is a massive metropolitan area. Milan is 1/8th the size and less dense. If +2000 people are dying a day in NYC, I can tell you the population better be getting that UBI check soon. Because of this unprecedented rate of infection, we soon will have to triage patients and pick who lives and dies  6. Unemployment will be disastrous. You cannot have +20% employment and have a stable society. You know what other countries have +20-30 unemployment %? Here’s a few: Yemen, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Botswana, Libya.  7. Bottom line this will get very very bad, leading the world in deaths type bad...very soon. Trump and Fox will politicize this to deflect blame and will only pit factions against each other. He is picking Easter as a day to open things up. We’ll be nearing a peak by that time, he will look really bad. All he needs to say is something like, “well maybe these cities should have supported me and I would be more inclined to send aid”. He will say something that goes way too far and ignite open conflict I believe.  SPY $95 12/18 is sub 1 dollar and -60% breakeven. Everything below that is also dirt cheap. I will be picking up these at bottom barrel prices.

It's still under the radar, but won't be for very long.    &amp;nbsp;  I went Friday to look at a gun, a model I've been putting off for a rainy day. Well, as soon as I got to Academy, I saw the counter was packed. A lot of their inventory was gone, and almost all the ammo.  They said orders were being delayed by two weeks. So I went to two local gun shops a couple miles away.  Both packed. The energy in these places were palpable.  You could tell the owners &amp; employees were swamped. They kept saying this was the craziest they've ever seen it, in different ways, every place I went.  So I perused 5 local shops total, and 3 big retailers between Friday and Saturday: Academy, Sportsman W-house, Bass Pro.  I finally got the one I was looking for, but half the reason I kept looking was to see if everywhere was the same thing.  Biggest surprise.. ammo.  Every single place was low on ammo. Most ar rifles were gone, saw a lot of people buying pistols. But I kid you not, every single one of the EIGHT places had the same exhausted story from the guys behind the glass. Academy and Bass both said they were giving two-week timeframes for backorder. And a story I heard in one of the local shops, a guy said he just got back from TX where the stores were being bought up, but didn't think it would be like that here.   &amp;nbsp;  Of course I was thinking of RGR stock, as they're really the only pure play right now on just firearms.  So I got home and started looking for stories across the country, in local stations about gun stores.. and found these, among others:  &amp;nbsp;   https://dailygazette.com/article/2020/03/21/local-gun-sales-soar-as-virus-fears-mount  https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/world-news/in-pics-americans-are-panic-buying-guns/16/03/    &lt;-----Twitter Posts From Everywhere  https://indyeastend.com/news-opinion/covid-19/covid-19-spikes-gun-sales/  https://www.enterprisenews.com/news/20200322/middleboro-lakeville-stores-gun-ammo-sales-soar-amid-coronavirus-crisis  https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/local/story/2020/mar/23/outbreak-drives-increased-firearm-ammo-sales/821741/  https://44news.wevv.com/nationwide-run-guns-amid-coronavirus-stock/  https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/03/18/purchases-firearms-ammo-surge-amid-covid-19-fears/2865796001/  &amp;nbsp;  **ALSO**, the online sports retailers and online independent gunshops are showing sold out of almost all their inventory, especially rifles. Along with 'delay' banners  across most of their sites.    And this:  https://imgur.com/a/fXUbo3Q  https://imgur.com/a/JkHTM4u   &amp;nbsp;   It's real, it's national and it's perhaps the biggest buying trend outside of toilet paper, only no one realizes it's happening yet. And the trend is going to have serious lasting power. Ruger is not only good quality for a decent price, but it's one of the most popular guns for first time buyers. Perfect for this specific environment, new buyers and people who just want stuff that works. They have the best capacity for ramping up production, compared to other smaller manufacturers. If stores need to order, they know they can order Ruger. It's also the only pureplay. S&amp;W got acquired by AOBC, and there are no other liquid instruments to express with, adding to the possible bottleneck of speculators into RGR. Very importantly, Ruger has no debt. They are well equity capitalized. They fit the perfect profile for a stock that can withstand a shock in which more indebted companies are having trouble right now. They're one of the only and perhaps from what I've seen with my own eyes, the most.. positively exposed product company for experiencing a windfall in revenue right now, and for the foreseeable months ahead.    &amp;nbsp;  Here's why the trade structure makes sense. They just reported earnings Feb 19th, but that covered the period 9/31-12/31, and the report was lackluster so the stock didn't get to an elevated level already.  All the gun sales started to ramp up early January, and then into February, before going completely bonkers in March, which ends in 7 days. Not only is this quarter going to be a blowout, but the guidance going for Q2 is going to be extremely elevated and in-turn, the 2020 yearly outlook as well. Try finding that kind of concentrated sales growth with already established gross and net margins on a non-debt balance sheet anywhere in the market right now. Nearly impossible.  Most those other thematic trades don't have this kind of real world, concentrated healthy outlook, and actually make profit doing so.  So the next earnings report is 5/20, and the earliest expiry that encapsulates it is 17_Jul, and the next contract after that, 16_Oct, encapsulates two earnings reports. So without going into all the details of why this trade makes the most sense to me for a safe, longer-term, higher amount trade, but still with a nice return, the trade is:   &amp;nbsp;  Selling 17jul 50p/35p credit vertical spread @ Cr +6.30  using proceeds to buy:  16oct 50c     @ -5.80  17apr 52.5c     @ -0.75    &amp;nbsp;  The only question is timing entry of this trade. With limit daily moves in the indexes, I'd rather enter on a large down day.  But it is possible that on a down market, it strongly outperforms, as it did yesterday.  Another thing to keep in mind, it's not a component of the S&amp;P index, giving it more freedom to vary from SPY.   &amp;nbsp;|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1044348.0|public|confidence|self|The case for RGR, the bear market TSLA?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo6wxx/the_case_for_rgr_the_bear_market_tsla/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'JQaEYA4YtZAjB-A2clWpewujwttPDOJovmEj4q_D6eQ', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5d15d2e9cebacbd8196e85b4a26783507349fe', 'width': 108}, {'height': 112, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2451ee074bfd314556f6e539d306a2802b9115', 'width': 216}, {'height': 166, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7284a419aec06ea4b913a220850ade54be03ad', 'width': 320}, {'height': 332, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9854225d960b4b64e9733f1d87afccf829dd1f0e', 'width': 640}, {'height': 499, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4857f4f60b086e5776b06461681f796297431c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 561, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b340b65eecdb9e3d98d9b9621d38301ea791f', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 654, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0448718479b9db5b330c400fc936d3e6575812de', 'width': 1258}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2020-03-24|EXPR

Well, as soon as I got to Academy, I saw the counter was packed. A lot of their inventory was gone, and almost all the ammo.  They said orders were being delayed by two weeks. So I went to two local gun shops a couple miles away.  Both packed. The energy in these places were palpable.  You could tell the owners &amp; employees were swamped. They kept saying this was the craziest they've ever seen it, in different ways, every place I went.  So I perused 5 local shops total, and 3 big retailers between Friday and Saturday: Academy, Sportsman W-house, Bass Pro.  I finally got the one I was looking for, but half the reason I kept looking was to see if everywhere was the same thing.  Biggest surprise.. ammo.  Every single place was low on ammo. Most ar rifles were gone, saw a lot of people buying pistols. But I kid you not, every single one of the EIGHT places had the same exhausted story from the guys behind the glass. Academy and Bass both said they were giving two-week timeframes for backorder. And a story I heard in one of the local shops, a guy said he just got back from TX where the stores were being bought up, but didn't think it would be like that here.   Of course I was thinking of RGR stock, as they're really the only pure play right now on just firearms.  So I got home and started looking for stories across the country, in local stations about gun stores.. and found these, among others:     https://dailygazette.com/article/2020/03/21/local-gun-sales-soar-as-virus-fears-mount  https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/world-news/in-pics-americans-are-panic-buying-guns/16/03/    &lt;-----Twitter Posts From Everywhere  https://indyeastend.com/news-opinion/covid-19/covid-19-spikes-gun-sales/  https://www.enterprisenews.com/news/20200322/middleboro-lakeville-stores-gun-ammo-sales-soar-amid-coronavirus-crisis  https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/local/story/2020/mar/23/outbreak-drives-increased-firearm-ammo-sales/821741/  https://44news.wevv.com/nationwide-run-guns-amid-coronavirus-stock/  https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/03/18/purchases-firearms-ammo-surge-amid-covid-19-fears/2865796001/   **ALSO**, the online sports retailers and online independent gunshops are showing sold out of almost all their inventory, especially rifles. Along with 'delay' banners  across most of their sites.    And this:   https://imgur.com/a/fXUbo3Q                  https://imgur.com/a/JkHTM4u      It's real, it's national and it's perhaps the biggest buying trend outside of toilet paper, only no one realizes it's happening yet. And the trend is going to have serious lasting power. Ruger is not only good quality for a decent price, but it's one of the most popular guns for first time buyers. Perfect for this specific  environment, new buyers and people who just want stuff that works. They have the best capacity for ramping up production, compared to other smaller manufacturers. If stores need to order, they know they can order Ruger. It's also the only pureplay. S&amp;W got acquired by AOBC, and there are no other liquid instruments to express with, adding to the possible bottleneck of speculators into RGR. Very importantly, Ruger has no debt. They are well equity capitalized. They fit the perfect profile for a stock that can withstand a shock in which more indebted companies are having trouble right now. They're one of the only and perhaps from what I've seen with my own eyes, the most.. positively exposed product company for experiencing a windfall in revenue right now, and for the foreseeable months ahead.    Here's why the trade structure makes sense. They just reported earnings Feb 19th, but that covered the period 9/31-12/31, and the report was lackluster so the stock didn't get to an elevated level already.  All the gun sales started to ramp up early January, and then into February, before going completely bonkers in March, which ends in 7 days. Not only is this quarter going to be a blowout, but the guidance going for Q2 is going to be extremely elevated and in-turn, the 2020 yearly outlook as well. Try finding that kind of concentrated sales growth with already established gross and net margins on a non-debt balance sheet anywhere in the market right now. Nearly impossible.  Most those other thematic trades don't have this kind of real world, concentrated healthy outlook, and actually make profit doing so.  So the next earnings report is 5/20, and the earliest expiry that encapsulates it is 17_Jul, and the next contract after that, 16_Oct, encapsulates two earnings reports. So without going into all the details of why this trade makes the most sense to me for a safe, longer-term, higher amount trade, but still with a nice return, the trade is:   Selling 17jul 50p/35p credit vertical spread @ Cr +8.10  using proceeds to buy  16oct 50c     @ -6.10 17apr 50c     @ -1.75    The only question is timing entry of this trade. With limit daily moves in the indexes, I'd rather enter on a large down day.  But it is possible that on a down market, it strongly outperforms, as it did yesterday.  Another thing to keep in mind, it's not a component of the S&amp;P index, giving it more freedom to vary from SPY.  |True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1044299.0|public|confidence|self|The case for RGR, the bear market TSLA??|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo6mwa/the_case_for_rgr_the_bear_market_tsla/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'JQaEYA4YtZAjB-A2clWpewujwttPDOJovmEj4q_D6eQ', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5d15d2e9cebacbd8196e85b4a26783507349fe', 'width': 108}, {'height': 112, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2451ee074bfd314556f6e539d306a2802b9115', 'width': 216}, {'height': 166, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7284a419aec06ea4b913a220850ade54be03ad', 'width': 320}, {'height': 332, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9854225d960b4b64e9733f1d87afccf829dd1f0e', 'width': 640}, {'height': 499, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4857f4f60b086e5776b06461681f796297431c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 561, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b340b65eecdb9e3d98d9b9621d38301ea791f', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 654, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oEt5DC0GlMSFtzXa1fIw47hDF7LrNMl9zjNwk9cFeEM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0448718479b9db5b330c400fc936d3e6575812de', 'width': 1258}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2020-03-24|EXPR

This is no joke.    Accordingly, we are taking this matter very seriously.  It's like super serious!   Like people will die and society will unravel.  Years from now you will tell future generations about the _disgusting_ things you had to do to get your 300th extra roll of toilet paper.    So what are we doing:  - Closing schools (remember how many times they didn't close your school when you were a kid and now they close it for at least a month!  Kids these days have it so easy!).  Yep.  - Restricting travel to other countries.  Yep.  - Closing restaurants and bars (drinking away the pain at home just doesn't express my misery enough, I need to be in some piece of shit bar drinking grain alcohol).  Yep.  - America alone spending at least a trillion to address it.  Yeppers.  - Giving everyone equal access to test since it's a ""humanitarian crisis"".  Wait...   The testing facility won't even test me unless I see a doctor and prove that I don't have the flu or strep throat first.  That means I have to go to see a doctor before I can go to the testing facility you're asking me to go to during work hours since I can't go to work because the virus is so serious, I can't even work).  And yet ALL of the Lakers and Nets have been tested and they didn't even have to get out of their car once to do it.  It's almost as if, [cash rules everything around me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwAxmrE194).   .  .  .  Because it does.  And there's a lot less money being spent in a world where I sit on the my couch holding onto my cash to make sure I make my mortgage payment.  They'd much rather I give some money to my weed guy, spend a ton more money buying snacks and then my weed guy buys Jordan's with the money I paid him.  Win-Win-Win.  Giving the Lakers and Nets special access to testing shows the common denominator in life is STILL money.    Come the end of the month people will prioritize money again, everyone will go back to work, and the economy will make money again.    Why 3/31?  Because changing the calendar changes your mentality when it comes to big events.  You'll suddenly feel different in April.  The virus will be so-February by then.  Plus, April means Spring in people's minds.

The vaccine known as BNT162 has shown good performance and once approved by relevant authorities will commerce clinical trial at the end of April. Trial areas will include Europe, China and USA.  Recently mRNA has become a focus for COVID-19 vaccine development. mRNA retains the advantage of DNA vaccine's ability to express intracellular antigen, but also has advantage in being able to avoid nonspecific immune antibody and thus allow stronger and more effective immunity. In addition mRNA therapy is based on the ability to trigger the body to produce specific immunoglobulin, so it has improved safety as well as allow rapid R&amp;D and production when it comes to mRNA based vaccine.  BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin says ""We are working closely with regulatory authorities and other peers such as Pfizer in the infectious disease field to allow more rapid testing, so that the vaccine could be ready for the world as soon as possible. In addition we are also working on a treatment for already infected patients which we will reveal more information about in the following weeks.""  Recently there's been reports by the media that Pfizer and BioNTech signed a cooperation agreement on vaccine development. Previously Pfizer invested 425 million USD in BioNTech for flu vaccine development in 2018.  In another notice published on 16/03/2020. BioNTech announced that it is in cooperation with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Development Co.,Ltd. The agreement includes clinical trial program in China for BNT162 vaccine as well as later commercialisationn  BioNTech indicates that China has agreed to invest 120 million euro, including 44 million Euro in shares for BioNTech and 1.58 million for capital. This would translate to a purchase of 0.7% of the shares of BioNTech by Fosun Pharma.  Fosun Pharma plans to sell the vaccine in China, while BioNTech retains the global distribution rights. Across the globe many pharmaceutical companies are in a race for COVID-19 vaccine. Including CureVac, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna.  Recently there's been signs of nations squabbling over medical supplies and treatments. The US was seen trying to make a move on one of BioNTech's competition CureVac. The main share holder of CureVac, SAP's founder Dietmar Hopp has indicated he does not wish to provide a vaccine exclusively for a naiton or region. For BioNTech they are also in negotiation with their existing partner Pfizer on distribution rights for the vaccine in areas besides China.  BioNTech was established in 2008 with headquartered in Mainz. It mainly works in the field of personalised immunotherapy for patients of cancer, infectious diseases and chronic infections. It is one of the main players in the mRNA treatment field. This company was at one time the largest biotech company in Europe. It was first listed on NASDAQ on October 2019.  BioNTech relies on their own mRNA platform. Messenger RNA vaccine can be developed and produced faster than traditional vaccines. BioNTech plan to work with partner Polymun to produce the vaccine in Europe."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1019864.0|public|confidence|self|BioNTech developing COVID-19 vaccine|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk3juc/biontech_developing_covid19_vaccine/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-03-17|EXPR

Note that many of these factors are applicable the USA and various other European regions.  Nb. This is intended to be informational for people within the UK so please comment if I have missed anything or if you feel any corrections are warranted.  * No social distancing measures.  * Telling the general public that masks are not effective. In Taiwan, HK and Korea the official line is that wearing a simple surgical mask will make you 5 times less likely to become infected from exposure and significantly decrease the likelihood of the wearer infecting others. TVBS, SCMP etc.  * Daily UK TV news spots claiming ""This is just a Flu"" whilst WHO have reported that Covid19 fatality rate is 34 times higher and the hospitalisation rate is 10 times higher for severe cases and 25 times higher for critical cases. BBC News, Sky News etc.  * UK media reporting a 1% CFR even though the WHO has explicitly stated 3.4% CFR numerous times. BBC, Guardian, Sky News, Daily Mail, Telegraph etc.  * Number of positive cases in the UK being portrayed by local media as the ""Total number of infections"" and not qualified as being the ""Total number of known infections"" which is a considerable difference. BBC, Guardian, Sky News, Express, Daily Mail etc.  * UK govt building projections re: hospital demand around a 4% hospitalisation rate whilst the WHO have stated this is a steady 20% (and worse in Italy) with 25% of hospitalised cases requiring ventilators which are already in short supply in UK hospitals.  * UK quarantine guidelines are still based around the 2 week incubation model which we now know to be incorrect as of latest official figures from WHO. UK media still publishing incorrect information with regards to incubation periods. Guardian, BBC etc.  * In the UK, the rate of hospital beds per person is very low compared to China where most epidemiological data has been collected on Covid19/SARS-Cov-2 thus far. Per WHO figures, China has hospital capacity for 0.42% of the population whilst the UK has capacity for only 0.24%, most of which is already in use year round.  * UK media and Govt. are repeatedly leaning on the talking point that ""..many mild cases are being missed"" even though the WHO has stated officially that they do not believe such cases were missed and the majority of ""mild"" cases were still pneumonic to some degree. So much so that chest CT was still effective in identifying mild cases.  * Massive local shortages of masks and hand sanitizer.  * Steady proliferation of disinformation re: the Covid19/SARS-Cov-2 on UK social media. Eg. ""Masks not effective, hand sanitizer only kills bacteria etc.""  * Already high demand for existing hospital beds. Eg. Very sick non-Covd19 patients already unable to get a bed in an appropriate ward much of the time.  * Existing staffing issues in NHS hospitals will likely be compounded as the epidemic progresses.  * Indirect non-Covid19 deaths will likely occur due to lack of hospital beds / risk of contagion prohibiting hospitalisation of the elderly and infirm.  * Higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions in the middle age to elderly risk group compared to China where most of the epidemiological data has been collected with regards to SARS-Cov-2/Covid19.  * Limited capacity to provide chest CT scanning in UK hospitals. Chest x-ray, for which most UK hospitals have some capacity is not effective in detecting signs of Covid19 as shown in Chinese and Italian data.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 9th, 2020.  # **Wall Street braces for more market volatility as wild swings become the ‘new normal’ amid coronavirus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/investors-brace-for-more-volatility-as-wild-swings-become-new-normal.html)** ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 has never behaved like this, but Wall Street strategists say get used to it. ***** &gt; Investors just witnessed the equity benchmark swinging up or down 2% for four days straight in the face of the coronavirus panic. ***** &gt; In the index’s history dating back to 1927, this is the first time the S&amp;P 500 had a week of alternating gains and losses of more than 2% from Monday through Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said. ***** &gt; “The message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It’s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33. ***** &gt; “Uncertainty breeds greater market volatility,” Keith Lerner, SunTrust’s chief market strategist, said in a note. “Much is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.” ***** &gt; # More stimulus? &gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven’t triggered a sustainable rebound. ***** &gt; The Federal Reserve’s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day. ***** &gt; “The market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,” said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. “If the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.” ***** &gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn’t expect the moves to create a huge rebound. ***** &gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting. ***** &gt; # Where is the bottom? &gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds. ***** &gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank’s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak. ***** &gt; “The magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,” Chadha said in a note. “We do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.” ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020. ***** &gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling. ***** &gt; “It is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,” Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**  *****  # A ""Run of the Mill"" Drawdown  &gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.  &gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**  *****  # Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire  &gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**  &gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**  &gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**  &gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**  *****  # It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil  &gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**  &gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**  &gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**  *****  # 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%  &gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. “The decline in yields has been remarkable,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today’s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.”  &gt; As shown in LPL Research’s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?  &gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt &gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase &gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates  &gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?  &gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off &gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income &gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors &gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off  &gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it’s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.  *****  # U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On  &gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.  &gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it’s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)  &gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “February’s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.”  &gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the–year economic rebound.  *****  # Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time  &gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**  *****  # Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut  &gt; Today’s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these “emergency” or “surprise” rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.  &gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only “worked” once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.  &gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$ADBE**  &gt; * **$DKS** &gt; * **$AVGO**  &gt; * **$THO**  &gt; * **$ULTA**  &gt; * **$WORK**  &gt; * **$DG**  &gt; * **$SFIX**  &gt; * **$SOGO**  &gt; * **$DOCU**  &gt; * **$INO**  &gt; * **$CLDR**  &gt; * **$INSG**  &gt; * **$SOHU**  &gt; * **$BTAI**  &gt; * **$ORCL**  &gt; * **$HEAR**  &gt; * **$NVAX**  &gt; * **$ADDYY**  &gt; * **$GPS**  &gt; * **$AKBA**  &gt; * **$PDD**  &gt; * **$CYOU**  &gt; * **$FNV**  &gt; * **$MTNB**  &gt; * **$NERV**  &gt; * **$MTN**  &gt; * **$BEST**  &gt; * **$PRTY**  &gt; * **$NINE**  &gt; * **$AZUL**  &gt; * **$UNFI**  &gt; * **$PRPL**  &gt; * **$VSLR**  &gt; * **$KLZE**  &gt; * **$ZUO**  &gt; * **$DVAX**  &gt; * **$EXPR**  &gt; * **$VRA**  &gt; * **$AXSM**  &gt; * **$CDMO**  &gt; * **$CASY**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))   &gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))   *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Adobe Inc. $336.77 &gt; **Adobe Inc.

No China exposure because their business is based in the USA babyyyy (it’s like Wendy’s but without the shitty breakfast offerings) and it’s trading closeish to a 52 week low and the CEO and other insiders recently bought a fuckton of stock in it.  1) Super cheap when compared to its competitors - it has a 8.3 P/E vs 16.5 P/E competitor American Express, higher ROIC, higher margins, better underlying business but is still cheaper? That’s better than a boiling bowl of bat soup 🦇🥣  2) The stock dipped over 10% last month because they announced that 2020 revenue would be down because of higher operating expenses BUT they are investing in technology which they need to be successful in the long term, so I don’t see this as a negative and will pay off in the next few years  3) Weathered the 2008 financial crisis very well - while the S&amp;P was down 30%, $DFS only dipped 2.8%. Will weather any shortterm downturn easy peasy. You literally can’t go tits up.  4) $DFS makes 60% of revenue off of interest payments, this will continue as Americans (especially brokeass millennials living in their parents basement with $43 in RH) just keep borrowing and borrowing more and get swamped in debt   This is not a short term play or a meme stock, I’m buying 10/16 $82.50 calls, don’t be autistic and load up on 2/28 or anything, but over the long term, $DFS is a tendies printing machine and you can get it at a discount!

She is good looking if unsuccessful. Perfect for my needs. I live in the middle of nineteen different mountain ranges (even though this sounds like I am exaggerating, I'm not) so she lives about 3 hours away. Anyway we get to talking.. things go nice nice and she is going to come over for 4 days through New Years.. she gets time off from her fantastic job, etc. She starts telling me what she is going to do to me on the phone, blow me awake, give me multiple massages, cook for me, pin me to walls, make me fuck her.. but.. but, she says, none of this will happen the first time I see her of course not, cause she is no ho. I would never never think that anyway.. a few days of this beautiful conversation goes on after we set up our New Years clothes on extravaganza and then in a couple of my texts I use exclamation points! Well god fucking Lord Jesus, Allah, El, Tzevaot forbid I scream at this witch. She goes off on this and I'm like what? Chill bitch chill (maybe I didn't say bitch at this point, maybe). So fuck this common bipolar ostrich .. I block her moments later. Then hours pass and my dick is getting even more lonely than he already was. HE starts bitching at me because both he and I are certainly guaranteed 6 foot 28 year old pussy in 4 days.. he threatens to vacate the premises if I do not fix the situation. I agree and call her up.. 'Hi Lauren'(real name).. 'Hi Michael'(not my real name).. 'Did you calm down?'.. 'No'.. 'I used an exclamation mark'.. 'Yeah. I don't like being yelled at'.. 'I don't think that is yelling but okay'.. 'It is yelling!'.. 'That is how I text'.. 'I don't like it'.. 'I guess there is a divide here'.. 'What??! what do you mean? What is a divide!?!?! I won't be yelled at through text!!'.. she is really screaming now and I just click. So blocked.. conversation deleted, records deleted so my small member cannot force another conversation with the camel savant and then last Monday happens. I drove three hours north to this same city.. a city where humans live for a day of training at work. My wonderful company put me up at the Holiday Inn Express the night before. I walk in to check in -sweated out as I just climbed a mountain on the way there.. there is a famous one there I hadn't yet done and I'm retarded so I did it on an iced up cold day- up to the desk and the clerk girl asks me for my ID.. I hand it over and start looking at her.. her face.. those glasses, she looks really REALLY familiar (I either know her or I am desperate for a line here).. I am about to say something when the manager slides in next to her as she girl is having problems since it is a corporate res. She takes over and the girl continues looking at me as the short exchange with the manager happens. I go to my truck, get my bags, go up to the room.. come back down after mindlessly watching TV. Say hi to the manager as I go out and who cares what happens next. That night though I think.. 'was that her?'.. 'No she was too short plus the odds are stupid'.. a couple days later when I am home I think 'was that her? I think that might be her'.. 'No, she was too short'.. then Friday night and yesterday I start thinking 'It was her, are you really checking out her height at the counter?'.. (she is supposedly 5'11) So now I am 95 percent it is she and I am going back there tomorrow night and I'll be staying through Friday. I wonder what will happen. I also wonder what will happen as I am going to try to snatch some pussy off one of the women I am in training with. ..her nametag said Lauren.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|896768.0|public|confidence|self|An autistic love story|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8m77w/an_autistic_love_story/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||||||||||||||2020-02-24|EXPR

This virus unrestrained could remove \~.75% of the 65 year and older [population](https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/world-demographics/).    Currently the Corona virus has a mortality rate of [3.6%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) of those up to 60 years old and north of [8.0%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) for those 70 years and older while having a mortality rate of less than [1%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) for those younger than 50.     Also, it's almost twice as likely (1.7% vs. 2.8%)  to take out Grandpa than Grandma allowing for a gentler future maternal world.     Further, in the US in 2017 [$990B](https://www.ssa.gov/budget/FY19Files/2019BO.pdf) was spent on social security benefits with roughly $118B going to survivors.  Assuming we take out Grandpa and account for disability insurance, Corona has the opportunity to remove 6M of social security's 60M retirement claims in 2018 with an age targeting pandemic.   Taking the average monthly SS payment of [$1,471](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/social-security/articles/what-is-the-maximum-possible-social-security-benefit) against those 6M this represents an annual budgetary savings of  $105.1B.  The budgetary gap between expenses and non-interest income for SS in 2019 was [$81B.](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html)  Corona immediately puts Social Security in a good position if we simply do Chinese Take out.  But wait there's more... 36% of all healthcare spending occurs on those above the age of 55 with an average annual spend of [$10,676](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-expenditures-vary-across-population/) by those age 65 and older.   Or looking at that same 6M people this represents another annual savings of $63.9B.   So really, if you think about it... Corona isn't going to hurt our economy in the long run...  Wuhan Market Panic is going to save our social spending in the US and throughout the world and repatriate that stagnant capital from the Baby boomers back to us Autists.

The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week.

In the first - 2nd years, I was a consistent loser, just one of those that if you were to bet against me, you’ll win 90% of the time, should of had a friend did that.  •When i just started, like everyone, I was in search of the holy grails, Nirvana, tip of tip, market reversals and bank big.  •My  3rd -4.5th year, was near the breakeven line, sometimes up, sometimes down, not losing, not gaining  •over the course of time, I’ve learned many things and improved my trading to the breakeven point.  •Regular trading stuff, stop loss, money management, no trigger happy, patience, etc. it took a while to fix these psychological problems, like holding the urge to jizz.  •But the thing that changed everything was edge. Not any kind of edge, the holy grail edge, why do I say it’s holy grail kind? Because in trading there’s only 3 things that matters, entry, exist, and size. And it’s pretty damn precise. But I’m not gonna get further into this right now.  •Moral of the story, I’m gonna break one of the rules that all professional traders will advise against, and that is over leverage, I am going to take out 100k in credit card loans, and take it as a challenge to turn it into 200k over the course of 2020.

Happy Friday to all! Here are your pre-market mover &amp; news this AM-  *****  #[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/coronavirus-closes-shanghai-disney-tech-layoffs-and-stumpf-ban.html)  * U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open ahead of the Friday session, with the final disposition of the holiday-shortened trading week still to be determined. The Dow is currently on track to post a losing week, its second in four weeks, while the Nasdaq is likely to rise for the seventh week in a row after a record close Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 is just below breakeven for the week, and would post its eighth weekly gain in since weeks if it can erase that deficit. (CNBC) American Express (AXP), a Dow component, releases earnings before today’s opening bell. No major earnings reports are scheduled after today’s closing bell, and no economic reports out today. (CNBC) * Dow stock Intel (INTC) was rising 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and revenue after the bell Thursday. Results were helped by improvement in personal computer and data center demand, and Intel also gave an upbeat current quarter outlook as well as announcing a 5% dividend increase. (CNBC) * A large broadcast satellite, owned by AT&amp;T’s (T) DirecTV, built by Boeing (BA) and operated by Intelsat (I), suffered major damage to its batteries in December and is now at risk of exploding. The satellite is notably several years beyond its intended lifespan. (CNBC) * Boeing reschedules 777X plane’s first test flight for today (Reuters) * China’s National Health Commission said as many as 26 people have died from a fast-spreading coronavirus, as the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 830. Multiple cases of the virus have been confirmed in Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan, while the United States, Taiwan and Singapore have each reported one case. China has extended its travel ban to 13 cities, covering 35 million people. (CNBC &amp; NY Times) * CDC: Level 3 health warning for coronavirus; State Department: Level 2 travel advisory (CNBC) * China to build 1000-bed hospital over weekend (Reuters) * Social controls, SARS experience help China close off cities (AP) * Walt Disney’s (DIS) Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice to help China stop the spread of the flu-like virus, costing the theme park operator revenue during the country’s biggest holiday season. China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, a period when the Shanghai Disney park would be usually packed with tourists. (Reuters) * The World Economic Forum is wrapping up today in Davos, Switzerland. A Hong Kong property developer said the U.S. chose the wrong decade to start a trade conflict with China. “They should have picked the war 10 years ago,” said David Chiu, chairman of Far East Consortium International. (CNBC) * George Soros rips Trump and Xi, says the ‘fate of the world’ is at stake in 2020 (CNBC) * Soros says Xi is the ‘most dangerous’ opponent of those who believe in open society (CNBC) * Soros warns Trump of potential economic doom before election (CNBC) * Soros says Elizabeth Warren ’is the most qualified to be president’ (CNBC) * Democrats will press their final day of arguments today before skeptical Republican senators at President Trump’s impeachment trail, focusing on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress’ investigation. House prosecutors made an expansive case yesterday that he abused power like no other president in history, swept up by a “completely bogus” Ukraine theory pushed by attorney Rudy Giuliani. (AP) * Former VP Joe Biden leads other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, while several others appeared to be gaining momentum in their bid for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll. The online poll showed that 24% of registered Democrats and independents supported Biden, while 20% backed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and 12% said they would vote for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. * The Trump administration is set to release a report today that outlines its short-term and long-term plans for enlisting e-commerce companies to combat counterfeit products on their platforms. The Wall Street Journal reported that law enforcement will begin identifying cases immediately and “seek all available statutory authorities to pursue civil fines and other penalties against these entities.” * J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon got a 1.6% raise to $31.5 million for his work in 2019 after his bank posted record earnings and shares of the company surged. Dimon’s compensation package includes $1.5 million in salary and $30 million in performance-based incentives. (CNBC) * The U.S. government announced that former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has been banned from ever working at a bank again and will pay $17.5 million for scandals in which millions of fake accounts were set up to meet sales quotas. Regulators plans to target other individuals, including former executives, for their role in the scandals. (CNBC) * Home DNA-testing company 23andMe is laying off about 100 people, or 14% of its staff, on Thursday, in the wake of declining sales. The company plans to tighten its focus on the * DTC business and its therapeutics arm while scaling back its clinical studies arm. Additionally, TripAdvisor is planning to cut 200 jobs, or 5% of its total workforce. (CNBC) * Jim Lehrer, co-host and later host of the nightly PBS “NewsHour” that for decades offered a thoughtful take on current events, has died. He was 85. Lehrer died “peacefully in his sleep,” according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983 and more recently, had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008.

With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe. ***** &gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday. ***** &gt; But it’s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market’s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year. ***** &gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388. ***** &gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher. ***** &gt; “2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,” said Golub. “I think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.” ***** &gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. “The first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,” Golub said. “The same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.” ***** &gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story. ***** &gt; “While everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they’re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,” he said. ***** &gt; The hearings on Trump’s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone. ***** &gt; “Will there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,” wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. “Let’s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum — for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/‘the anti-Trump’, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the ‘anti-Trump’ vote — a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.” *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**  *****  # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately  &gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**  *****  # A Closer Look At Election Years  &gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 31% total return.  &gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.  &gt; “If an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “On the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.”  &gt; Note that a “lame duck president” means the sitting president either isn’t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a “lame duck president” both years.  &gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a “lame duck president”.  &gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market’s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can’t always tell you who will win in November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020  &gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.  &gt; We’ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market’s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”  &gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6–7% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.  &gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.  *****  # January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start – But 2nd Half Is Weaker  &gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today’s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.  &gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.  &gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**  *****  # January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks  &gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month’s end.  &gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth “Lame Duck” Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other “Monthly Barometers” using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite  &gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.  &gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.  &gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader’s Almanac) reports at month’s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow’s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**  *****  # Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout  &gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**  *****  # Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline  &gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.  &gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$NFLX**  &gt; * **$FCEL**  &gt; * **$HAL**  &gt; * **$INTC**  &gt; * **$PG**  &gt; * **$UAL**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$AAL**  &gt; * **$ALLY**  &gt; * **$CMA**  &gt; * **$AXP**  &gt; * **$ASML**  &gt; * **$TAL**  &gt; * **$LUV**  &gt; * **$JBLU**  &gt; * **$TEAM**  &gt; * **$KMI**  &gt; * **$PLD**  &gt; * **$SWKS**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$MBWM**  &gt; * **$TXN**  &gt; * **$COF**  &gt; * **$ONB**  &gt; * **$UNP**  &gt; * **$AMTD**  &gt; * **$FNB**  &gt; * **$SBNY**  &gt; * **$RCI**  &gt; * **$KMB**  &gt; * **$STM**  &gt; * **$AUB**  &gt; * **$ERIC**  &gt; * **$BKR**  &gt; * **$KEY**  &gt; * **$NAVI**  &gt; * **$NEE**  &gt; * **$APH**  &gt; * **$NTRS**  &gt; * **$CBU**  &gt; * **$TER**  &gt; * **$ZION**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019.  # **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend. ***** &gt; Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market. ***** &gt; In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.  &gt; President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks. ***** &gt; The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday. ***** &gt; # Best month of year &gt; 2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period. ***** &gt; “December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps. ***** &gt; “The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.” ***** &gt; Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said. ***** &gt; The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted. ***** &gt; # S&amp;P Sub-industry sector performance &gt; Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers. ***** &gt; While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail. ***** &gt; “You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December. ***** &gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November. ***** &gt; Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665. ***** &gt; Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month. ***** &gt; # Trade tensions &gt; The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts. ***** &gt; The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch. ***** &gt; Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending. ***** &gt; Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers. ***** &gt; “For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.” ***** &gt; In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming. ***** &gt; The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram. ***** &gt; October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction. ***** &gt; Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said. ***** &gt; OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/krn4X8s.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0N3eZNQ.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wfpCVKo.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/6hH0LB5.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eJrTsNy.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6GHXuN4.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KNR2UeA.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PPZszVh.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/quoq9I8.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hx18PQx.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dyb9PiQ.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/29/19  &gt; Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week's data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed's index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed's gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco1.png))**  &gt; We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week's main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco3.png))**  *****  # Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For  &gt; Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png))**  &gt; Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple's (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;P 500's 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).  &gt; Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;P's gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;P's move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they're certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-1.png))**  *****  # S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png))**  &gt; So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it's only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What's interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can't hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA.png))**  *****  # Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years  &gt; As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors' valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years' range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years' readings.  &gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**  &gt; As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities' P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.  &gt; For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade's range was back in early 2018.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**  *****  # Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade  &gt; Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.  &gt; Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).  &gt; So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7530bdceacb9ab4ad89d60e1bfa600c6/e574aa1a79d9670c-8e/s1280x1920/68c23f59d4bb7d3db3f2442c93e28fd6b34c1b43.jpg))**  *****  # Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer  &gt; This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.  &gt; Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.  &gt; “Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”  &gt; Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.  &gt; Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.  &gt; Overall, we would need to see more significant deterioration in consumer confidence before we would start to worry about the economic outlook.  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 29th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.1.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKaAO9lBhHI))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$CRM**  &gt; * **$DG**  &gt; * **$ULTA**  &gt; * **$COUP**  &gt; * **$MRVL**  &gt; * **$WDAY**  &gt; * **$ZS**  &gt; * **$RH**  &gt; * **$OKTA**  &gt; * **$TIF**  &gt; * **$CRWD**  &gt; * **$KR**  &gt; * **$CLDR**  &gt; * **$DSX**  &gt; * **$WORK**  &gt; * **$BMO**  &gt; * **$ZM**  &gt; * **$CPB**  &gt; * **$FIVE**  &gt; * **$QTT**  &gt; * **$DOCU**  &gt; * **$MIK**  &gt; * **$TD**  &gt; * **$YJ**  &gt; * **$LE**  &gt; * **$AVAV**  &gt; * **$RY**  &gt; * **$SNPS**  &gt; * **$HQY**  &gt; * **$DC**I  &gt; * **$BIG**  &gt; * **$GSM**  &gt; * **$SIG**  &gt; * **$SMAR**  &gt; * **$GIII**  &gt; * **$HOME**  &gt; * **$HRB**  &gt; * **$DLTH**  &gt; * **$TLYS**  &gt; * **$ZUO**  &gt; * **$GEF**  &gt; * **$JW.A**  &gt; * **$GMS**  &gt; * **$EXPR**  &gt; * **$ZUMZ**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/quoq9I8.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mywSpNl.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zs45439.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 12.2.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KZWGsjz.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 12.2.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ftRuDn9.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.3.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VkgixQd.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.3.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuGkERA.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.4.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d6vK0bH.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.4.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RWKsVGd.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.5.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ACoje91.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.5.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1GYcu89.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.6.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lHfhwMG.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.6.19 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Salesforce $162.89 &gt; **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, December 3, 2019.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.  ## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days) Company|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

The GDP miss weighed on China's Shanghai Composite (-1.3%) on Friday, even though industrial production and retail sales for September did increase more than expected.   Back on the home front, the first big week of earnings season is wrapping up and results continue to come in mostly better than expected. Coca-Cola reported revenue that was just above expectations, and it slightly improved its revenue outlook. American Express beat earnings estimates and reported in-line revenue.   Today's economic data will be limited to the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.   U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.46. WTI crude is up 1.1%, or $0.57, to $54.50/bbl.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Coca-Cola** (KO 54.45, +0.66): +1.2% after reporting in-line results and slightly improving its revenue outlook.  * **American Express** (AXP 120.90, +1.80): +1.5% after beating earnings estimates and reported in-line revenue.  * **Schlumberger** (SLB 32.45, +0.56): +1.8% after beating earnings estimates.  * **Macy's** (M 15.06, -0.72): -4.9% after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock, as well as **Gap** (GPS 16.81, -0.76, -4.3%) and **L Brands** (LB 17.23, -0.87, -4.8%), to Underperform from Neutral.   Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the week on a mostly lower note. Japan's Nikkei +0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite -1.3%, India's Sensex +0.6%, South Korea's Kospi -0.8%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.    * In economic data:       * China's Q3 GDP +1.5% qtr/qtr, as expected (last 1.6%); +6.0% yr/yr (expected 6.1%; last 6.2%).

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 14th, 2019.  # **Profits expected to fall as earnings season kicks off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/profits-expected-to-fall-as-earnings-season-kicks-off-in-the-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; The third-quarter earnings season kicks off in the coming week, and it is likely to expose how much the trade war has cost companies’ bottom lines. ***** &gt; First out of the gate are major banks and financial companies, with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs reporting Tuesday. But by the end of the week, a smattering of industrial, tech, transportation and consumer names will have reported, including Alcoa and Honeywell. Netflix and IBM report Wednesday, and consumer giant Coca-Cola reports Friday. United Airlines reports Tuesday, and CSX reports Wednesday. ***** &gt; Besides earnings, some important economic reports are being released, including retail sales on Wednesday and industrial production Thursday. ***** &gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to decline by 3.1% for the third quarter, after growing by more than 3% in the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. For the second quarter, earnings were also expected to be negative to flat, but results beat lowered expectations. ***** &gt; “The story of are we going to be negative, or are we not going to be negative, is going to be in focus,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ***** &gt; Palfrey said margins are being pinched in several areas, including energy, with the decline in oil prices. Oil has been responding more to worries about global growth and trade wars than to geopolitical developments that normally could drive it higher. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 7.5% in the third quarter. ***** &gt; “We are of the view that companies will likely devote a significant portion of their time talking about the impact of trade tariffs,” Palfrey said. “The goal is to ascertain just how much the decline in earnings is coming from those pressures.” ***** &gt; The decline in oil prices, in fact, are expected to drag down profits in the energy sector. Earnings for the energy sector are expected to be down 32%, while revenues are expected to fall by 9.5%, according to Credit Suisse. Margins for the sector are expected to contract by 22.7%. Without energy estimates included, S&amp;P profits would be down just 1%, according to Refinitiv. ***** &gt; “We think margins are going to subtract 5.9% from EPS growth of the S&amp;P 500,” said Palfrey. He projects earnings overall to decline by 4.2%, and he does not expect the stock market to make much headway during the earnings season. ***** &gt; “I think we’re moving sideways. The real backstop is the environment, while under pressure, it is nonrecessionary, and that will ultimately prevent the market from materially selling off,” said Palfrey. ***** &gt; Palflrey said a group he calls “tech plus,” which include tech and communications companies, have taken some of the biggest margin hits this quarter even though revenue growth remains solid. Six of the top 10 companies whose margins impacted S&amp;P earnings growth the most are from that group, including Alphabet , Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Micron. ***** &gt; As a group, their margins are expected to contract by 14.8%, compared with 3.6% for all other S&amp;P 500 companies combined. ***** &gt; ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum are on the list of companies with the biggest margin hits. Exxon for example saw a decline in margins of 34%, and Credit Suisse estimates that pared 0.6% off overall S&amp;P 500 earnings growth. Credit Suisse says the consensus decline in Amazon margins is expected to be 42.5%, denting S&amp;P earnings growth by 0.3%. ***** &gt; “At least for earnings, it’s a relatively positive backdrop. We should see a little bit of clarity on the whole China trade,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. Hickey said in the past two quarters, stocks did well at the start of the reporting season, but they were then derailed by trade developments in the latter part of the earnings period. ***** &gt; Palfrey said the market is being held back by several factors, including the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. “I think it’s going to be difficult for the market to move meaningfully higher without an improvement in industrial data and without the yield curve becoming uninverted,” he said. ***** &gt; ISM manufacturing data has been weakening and has shown a contraction in activity for the past two months. ***** &gt; The inverted yield curve is a bond market recession warning. When the curve is inverted, shorter duration securities yield more than longer duration securities, meaning investors are demanding a higher yield to hold investments for a much briefer time. In this case, the 3-month Treasury bill was yielding about 11 more basis points than the 10-year note. ***** &gt; Hickey said there could be some positives in the earnings season, like last quarter. Negative revisions of earnings estimates by analysts are outnumbering positive revisions by about 2 to 1. He noted in the last two quarters, stocks responded well to earnings news in the beginning of the reporting period but then faded when negative headlines on trade in the latter part of each earnings season. ***** &gt; “Expectations seem pretty low. We’ve had analysts’ downward revisions remain elevated, as they’ve been heading into prior warning seasons. But we haven’t necessarily seen the number of warnings from companies rising,” he said. “It could be a positive divergence that analysts are lowering earnings estimates at a higher-than-average rate, but companies aren’t warning at a higher-than-average rate.” ***** &gt; Financial companies profits are expected to be up by 1.4%, and real estate is expected to see the best profit growth with a gain of 2.7%, according to Refinitiv. The information technology sector is expected to see a profit decline of 7.6%, and communications is expected to be 1% lower, according to Refinitiv. Materials is expected to see the biggest decline after energy. Sensitive to global growth and manufacturing, the sector’s earnings are expected to fall 11.1%. ***** &gt; Despite the downbeat expectations for third-quarter earnings, companies may issue more positive outlooks after China and the U.S. announced the first phase of a trade deal. ***** &gt; Stocks rallied Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all up more than 1%. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were also up around 1% for the week and snapped a three-week losing streak. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7ALiiKS.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6paUBRf.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZzHQ7gY.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/fMJp9b0.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/M04OsLr.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/njFewAJ.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0T6SRMQ.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AwWDCTj.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aba1Nd2.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kVovSfR.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eoOlkPy.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WaIYNyh.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Rgqt18G.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/EGocLGS.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/11/19  &gt; It was a disappointing week for US economic data as two-thirds of releases came in weaker than expected or than the prior period. Consumer Credit data for the month of August was the only major release on Monday, exceeding expectations, but declining from July’s level. Inflation data took the spotlight this week with the release of PPI, CPI, and export and import prices. Core CPI was inline with the previous month and the import price index’s decline (year over year) was smaller than forecasted, but other readings on inflation were weaker. Likewise, labor data had its share of disappointments as the JOLTS report showed a third consecutive decline in openings, hourly earnings growth slowed, and continuing claims ticked higher. Initial Jobless Claims provided some relief though, coming in at 210K compared to 220K expected and 219K last week. While small business optimism was weaker—NFIB’s index fell to 101.8 from 103.1—consumer sentiment readings from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan both rose with the latter exceeding expectations.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO1.png))**  &gt; Looking ahead to next week, the calendar is slightly busier with 22 releases on the docket in addition to earnings beginning to ramp up as a total of 115 companies report. There are no scheduled economic releases Monday due to Columbus Day, so next week’s data begins on Tuesday with Empire Manufacturing which is forecasted to fall from 2.0 to 0.5. Other manufacturing gauges, including the Philadelphia Fed’s index and industrial production, are also expected to fall. Retail Sales is scheduled for Wednesday and are expected to rise 0.3%. On Thursday, Housing Starts and Permit data are both expected to show moderation. The leading index is scheduled to round out the week on Friday.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO2.png))**  *****  # Fund Flows Favor Fixed Income  &gt; This week’s fund flow numbers from the Investment Company Institute showed that the long, steady rotation from equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds to fixed income funds has continued.  &gt; As shown below, the spread between equity fund flows and fixed income fund flows has reached a net reading of -$165.9bn over the last three months; that’s among the largest net flow out of equities and into bonds since the data starts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-Flows-1.png))**  &gt; Fixed income isn’t the only place that retail has been moving allocations to.

At the start of each earnings season, we publish our list of the most volatile stocks on earnings. Our Earnings Explorer tool contains a huge database that has every single quarterly earnings report for nearly all US-listed stocks going back to 2001. One part of the database tracks the one-day price reaction that stocks experience following their earnings reports, so users are able to easily track how individual stocks typically react to earnings.  &gt; In the table below, we show the stocks expected to report within the next month that have historically been the most volatile in reaction to earnings. To make the list, the company had to have at least 20 quarterly reports (5 years) and also have a current share price of $5 or more.  &gt; At the top of the list is Telecom equipment maker Infinera (INFN), which is scheduled to report on October 28th after the close. INFN just barely makes the cut because it trades at $5.20/share, but it has historically averaged a one-day absolute change of 15.16% on its historical earnings reaction days. You can expect a big move when it reports at the end of this month. Consumer review website YELP ranks as the second most volatile stock on earnings with an average one-day move of +/-14.85%. Enphase Energy (ENPH), LendingTree (TREE), and Applied Opto (AAOI) round out the top five with average one-day moves of more than +/-13% on their earnings reaction days. Other notables towards the top of the list include Wayfair (W), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR), which all typically move either up or down more than 12% on earnings.  &gt; Of the stocks on the list, Enphase (ENPH) is up by far the most in 2019 with a huge gain of 424%. Other stocks like Stamps.com (STMP), ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), and Green Dot (GDOT) are down more than 50% YTD. Twitter (TWTR), Blucora (BCOR), and Benefitfocus (BNFT) have the highest earnings beat rates at more than 90%. While it has a high beat rate, BNFT has been on a wild ride over the past two years, rallying from $24 up to $60 in 2018 before falling all the way back down to $24 as of today. You can bet a big move is in store when it reports on the 31st.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/allvol.png))**  &gt; If you're just interested in large-cap names, below is a list of the most volatile S&amp;P 500 stocks on earnings. These are stocks set to report over the next month, and as shown, Netflix (NFLX) is at the top of the list with an average one-day move of +/-12.78% on earnings. Twitter (TWTR), Align Tech (ALGN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Akamai (AKAM) rank 2nd through 5th in that order, while other notables include Amazon (AMZN), Advanced Micro (AMD), Chipotle (CMG), Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).  &gt; If you own or have interest in owning any of these names, buckle up because they're likely to experience a big move when they report at some point in the next few weeks!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxvol.png))**  *****  # Key Earnings Reports Over the Next Two Weeks  &gt; Our Earnings Calendar is part of our Earnings Explorer tool. The calendar shows the upcoming earnings report dates for US-listed companies over the next month, and investors use it as an easy way to monitor the names they're most interested in. We provide quite a bit of information for each company listed in the calendar, including EPS and sales estimates, its historical beat rates, and its average share price performance on its earnings reaction day. If you ever want to know how a stock typically trades in reaction to its earnings report, this is the place to go.  &gt; The Q3 2019 earnings reporting period finally kicks off next week when most of the big banks are set to report. But the biggest weeks for earnings will come in the back half of October and the first couple weeks of November. As shown in the chart below, the week of October 28th through November 1st is the busiest of them all when we'll see hundreds of companies report each day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/calen.png))**  &gt; Below is a list pulled from our Earnings Calendar of the key earnings reports to watch next week (based on market cap). There are no key reports to speak of on Monday the 14th due to Columbus Day, but on Tuesday we'll hear from Citigroup (C), Goldman (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) all before the open. On Wednesday, we'll get results from Bank of America (BAC) in the morning and then IBM and Netflix (NFLX) after the close, while on Thursday we'll hear from Morgan Stanley (MS), which will be the last of the major banks and brokers to report next week. American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Schlumberger (SLB) will finish off the week with reports on Friday morning.  &gt; Of the key stocks reporting next week, Goldman (GS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) beat EPS estimates the most often at more than 90% of the time. In terms of price reactions, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- which reports on Thursday afternoon -- has historically reacted the most positively to earnings with an average one-day gain of 3.24%. Bank of America (BAC) has the weakest price reaction to earnings with an average one-day drop of 0.95%.  &gt; In terms of earnings volatility, Netflix (NFLX) takes the cake with an average absolute one-day change of 12.78% on its earnings reaction day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key-reports-next-week-use.png))**  &gt; The following week (10/21-10/25) is when we'll really be in the heart of the Q3 reporting period. A large number of Dow 30 stocks will report that week, including big blue chips like McDonald's (MCD), United Tech (UTX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT). The most important report of the week will come on Thursday the 24th when Amazon (AMZN) announces after the close. AMZN is currently expected to announce earnings of $7.19/share and revenues of $68.7 billion for the quarter. AMZN doesn't have an abnormally high EPS beat rate at just 62.5%, but it is typically a very volatile name as its average one-day move on earnings has historically been nearly +/-10%. Just think, a 10% move for AMZN is a $174 swing in either direction based on its current share price.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key10211025.png))**  *****  # Is October Really Scary?  &gt; Just like that, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell more than 1% on the first day of October. The rough start has many investors on edge, as October is known for spectacular crashes—specifically 1929, 1987, and 2008.  &gt; On the flipside, September 2019 was historically calm for equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 didn’t fall 1% on a single day the entire month.  &gt; “The lack of any volatility in September could mean the usually volatile month of October could be due for some big swings,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news, though, is while October has had a bad rap for some big drops, over the past 20 years, it actually has been the third best month of the year for stocks.”  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, October has quietly been one of the strongest months of the year over the past 10 and 20 years. Going back to 1950, it ranks as the seventh strongest month of the year, so right near the middle of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/october-stocks_2019.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Four other things to consider: Since 1950, no month has had more 1% moves (higher or lower) than October. Since 1928, 6 of the 10 worst single-day drops have taken place in October; however, 3 of the 10 best days ever occurred in October as well. This is a pre-election year, and as the chart above shows, October’s average returns in a pre-election year have been muted since 1950. The catch here is that this average return is greatly impacted by the 21.8% drop in 1987. The median return is actually quite respectable. October has been higher during a pre-election year every year since 1999, with an average return of an impressive 6.5%.  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 11th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYXkkUWqnQ))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.13.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFd5cGe31do))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$NFLX**  &gt; * **$JPM**  &gt; * **$UNH**  &gt; * **$C**  &gt; * **$BAC**  &gt; * **$JNJ**  &gt; * **$GS**  &gt; * **$WFC**  &gt; * **$APHA**  &gt; * **$SCHW**  &gt; * **$ALLY**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$BLK**  &gt; * **$KO**  &gt; * **$PLD**  &gt; * **$UAL**  &gt; * **$PM**  &gt; * **$WIT**  &gt; * **$MS**  &gt; * **$IBM**  &gt; * **$AXP**  &gt; * **$FHN**  &gt; * **$FRC**  &gt; * **$URI**  &gt; * **$SLB**  &gt; * **$HON**  &gt; * **$CSX**  &gt; * **$PNC**  &gt; * **$UNP**  &gt; * **$TEAM**  &gt; * **$AA**  &gt; * **$USB**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$ERIC**  &gt; * **$CCI**  &gt; * **$BK**  &gt; * **$ASML**  &gt; * **$JBHT**  &gt; * **$CMA**  &gt; * **$TSM**  &gt; * **$TXT**  &gt; * **$SNBR**  &gt; * **$BBT**  &gt; * **$MBWM**  &gt; * **$GPC**  &gt; * **$KMI**  &gt; * **$KEY**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aba1Nd2.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PuhtXaX.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/YRRM2LU.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 10.14.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  &gt; # ***Monday 10.14.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 10.15.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/MJWa86V.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 10.15.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zu9Ow0t.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 10.16.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/eam8p95.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 10.16.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/KOCx48P.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 10.17.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/R3sTSi2.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 10.17.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/blMe0PL.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 10.18.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8WY2fuA.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 10.18.19 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Netflix, Inc. $282.93 &gt; **Netflix, Inc.

For those of you who listened to the post congrats and for those who didn't, this is your second opportunity.  Banks are going back up so my recommendation is JPM calls or Capital one calls, American Express looks good too. Also, SHOP is trying to recover from the downtrend but this one is like a 50/50.  Remember, this will work if Trump does a partial trade deal or stays neutral so my best recommendation is to wait until the news. If news is positive buy calls, then if negative buy puts on ETF because it has more volume and liquidity which allows you to scape in a any given situation.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|667377.0|public|confidence|self|Next plan after yesterday's SPY CAll reference|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dg0zjr/next_plan_after_yesterdays_spy_call_reference/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||[]|||1570813320.0|||||||||||2019-10-10|EXPR

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.  ## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days) Company|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

Currently, the S&amp;P 500 futures trade ten points, or 0.3%, above fair value after trading as high as 0.9% soon after the news.  Those goods are currently taxed at 25% and will now increase to 30% on Oct. 15 instead of Oct. 1, which would have coincided with the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. President Trump said his decision was a gesture of goodwill at the request of China's Vice Premier Liu He in front of the anniversary. China exempted certain U.S. products from a higher tariff rate yesterday.  Futures have recently ticked higher in the wake of the ECB's policy decision. The central bank lowered its deposit rate by ten basis points to -0.50% as expected. In addition, the ECB said net purchases of EUR 20 bln will be restarted in November and will end shortly before the bank begins to raise key interest rates.   On the data front, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 218,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Treasury Budget for August will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.   U.S. Treasuries are slightly higher following the ECB decision. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.71. WTI crude ($55.22, -0.53, -1.0%) extends its losses from yesterday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ will not consider deeper production cuts until its next meeting in December.   * **Oracle** (ORCL 55.23, -1.06): -1.9% after guiding Q2 EPS slightly below expectations and announcing CEO Mark Hurd will take a leave of absence for health reasons. Oracle also added $15 billion to its share buyback program.  * **Baker Hughes, a GE Company** (BHGE 21.80, -0.49): -2.2% after **General Electric** (GE 9.33, -0.03, -0.3%) said it plans to reduce its stake in the company to 38.4% from 50.4%, raising$2.7 billion in the process, according to *Reuters*.  Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note. Japan's Nikkei +0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.3%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.8%, India's Sensex -0.5%, South Korea's Kospi Closed for Full Moon Festival, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.2%.    * In economic data:       * China's August FDI 6.9% ytd (last 7.3%)       * Japan's July Core Machinery Orders -6.6% m/m (expected -9.0%; last 13.9%); +0.3% yr/yr (expected -4.5%; last 12.5%).

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.  For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.  At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to **Apple's** (**AAPL** 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it is expected to unveil its latest iPhone.   In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.  U.S. Treasuries are slightly lower, nudging yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.45. WTI crude is up 1.0% to $58.42/bbl, which could continue to benefit the oil-sensitive energy stocks that have bounced back this month.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Apple** (AAPL 213.73, -0.44): -0.2% ahead of its annual Special Event at 1:00 p.m. ET.  * **Wendy's** (WEN 20.00, -1.95): -8.9% after lowering its earnings guidance to reflect costs incurred to launch a breakfast menu in 2020.  * **Ford Motor** (F 9.19, -0.35): -3.7% after Moody's downgraded its senior unsecured rating to Ba1, or ""junk rating,"" from Baa3.   Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. Japan's Nikkei +0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng UNCH, China's Shanghai Composite -0.1%, India's Sensex Closed for Moharram, South Korea's Kospi +0.6%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.    * In economic data:       * China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

The S&amp;P 500 futures are up 28 points and trade 1.0% above fair value.   China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng, indicated the U.S. should withdraw plans for new tariffs and said both sides should create conditions for progress in trade negotiations. According to *Reuters*, Mr. Gao did not answer directly if his remarks suggested that Beijing would not retaliate against the latest tariff threat from the U.S.   Evidently, the futures market is liking China's softer stance today while the two sides continue to discuss a timetable for September trade talks.

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value.   The U.S. Treasury market remains a focal point after yesterday saw more flattening and/or inversions within the curve. Low yields are usually a positive consideration for risk assets, but there comes a point when investors begin to fear they are a harbinger for weaker economic and corporate earnings growth.   Currently, the 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.51%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.46%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.13. WTI crude is up 1.5% to $55.73/bbl following some bullish inventory data. Official government data will be released at 10:30 a.m. ET.   Elsewhere, UK Prime Minister Johnson has stirred some attention after he said he would request a suspension of Parliament until mid-October. This move would likely make it harder to block a no-deal Brexit by Oct. 31. The British pound has fallen against the dollar, while UK's FTSE (unch) sees relative strength against its peers.   Separately, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 6.2% following a 0.9% decline in the prior week.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Autodesk** (ADSK 132.25, -17.96): -12.0% after the software company issued downside guidance for next quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance.

Futures are currently trading near their best levels of the morning in what has been a calm pre-market session on Wall Street.   Trade rhetoric continues to come out of China, but it appears to be a rehash of prior comments. China's foreign ministry repeated there were no recent phone calls pertaining to trade, as President Trump remarked yesterday, but hopes the U.S. can set conditions for talks.   **Johnson &amp; Johnson** (**JNJ** 130.40, +2.60, +2.0%) is in the news after it was found liable by an Oklahoma judge for its part in the opioid crisis. Shares are up in pre-market action, though, after JNJ was ordered to pay just $572 million, which was much less than the $17 billion the state was asking. JNJ said it will appeal the ruling.   On the data front, investors will receive the FHFA Housing Price Index for June and the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for June (Briefing.com consensus 2.7%) at 9:00 a.m. ET, followed by the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 129.6) at 10:00 a.m. ET.   U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.50%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 97.91. WTI crude is up 1.3%, or $0.72, to $54.36/bbl after Iran said the U.S. should first lift sanctions if it wants to hold a meeting, according to *Bloomberg*.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Johnson &amp; Johnson** (JNJ 130.40, +2.60): +2.0% after being ordered to pay just $572 million by a judge, significantly less than the $17 billion the state of Oklahoma was asking for JNJ's part in the opioid crisis.  * **J.M.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 26th, 2019.  # **Week ahead: Stocks could be rocky on trade, economy fears, as August breaks low volatility streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/week-ahead-stocks-could-be-rocky-on-trade-economy.html)** ***** &gt; The final week of August — the bittersweet end of summer for many— could be highly volatile, as markets fret over the economy and the latest developments in trade wars. ***** &gt; President Donald Trump joins the G-7 leaders in France over the weekend, and markets will be watching to see if the meeting exposes new fault lines in the shaky relations among a once fairly congenial leadership group that fought the Great Recession together. Trump is expected to discuss the U.S. economy and highlight the U.S. pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda, under his leadership. ***** &gt; The U.S. trade war with China escalated sharply in the past week, with a new round of tariffs from China on U.S. goods announced Friday and new threats from Trump, who “ordered” American companies to find alternatives to China. That immediately triggered speculation that the trade war will be extended and more contentious, and the U.S. economy risks falling into recession. ***** &gt; After the close Friday, Trump retaliated against China’s tariffs by raising existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, as of Oct. 1. In a tweet, he also said he was raising new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods that have not yet gone into effect to 15% from 10%. ***** &gt; Friday’s trading was volatile, and stocks fell by about 2.5%, erasing what would have been a second positive week for the market. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to go lower amid worries about the economy and fears the Fed will not act aggressively enough to head off a recession. ***** &gt; Stocks have been volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 is down about 4.5% in the month of August. ***** &gt; Michael Arone, State Street Advisors chief investment strategist said the first seven months of the year were more certain for investors in terms of their expectations for Fed rate cuts and a possible trade deal. But the trade tensions have worsened, and the trade war could escalate even further. ***** &gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole Friday morning, but while he left the door open for rate cuts, he did not explicitly promise rate cuts. ***** &gt; “The Fed has become a lot less certain. Until we get more clarity, you’re likely to see this volatility, and stocks will trade sideways,” Arone said. Even though corporate earnings weakened, “investors took a big leap of faith in the first seven months of the year, expecting both a trade deal and monetary policy easing.” ***** &gt; The escalation of the trade war makes a deal unlikely anytime soon. This, however, did drive market expectations for rate cuts higher Friday afternoon, and the market was expecting three more cuts this year. ***** &gt; Trump tied his feuds with China and the Fed together Friday, when he tweeted that the Fed is not helping with easier rate policy, along with a question about “who is the bigger enemy” — China President Xi Jinping or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. ***** &gt; “I think the Fed is in uncharted territory, and I continue to have empathy for Chairman Powell. I think markets want faster and more aggressive policy. He’s dealing with challenges the Fed has never had,” said Arone. ***** &gt; ”[Powell] is literally walking a tight rope. He has the president who is daily bashing him,” he said. “Bond markets are demanding a much greater number of rate cuts, and he’s got geopolitical challenges, whether it’s Brexit or trade. He’s also got dissension among Fed voting members. That’s a lot to balance.” ***** &gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including durable goods Monday and personal spending and consumption data Friday, which also includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator. ***** &gt; “The data will give us some indications on business spending. Durable goods has capital expenditure orders. It looks look consumer confidence will come out [Tuesday] as well,” Arone said. Business spending has been taking a hit from the trade wars, and economists are concerned it will continue to weaken, ultimately leading to weakness in the consumer economy. ***** &gt; The week ahead could see some swings ahead of the long Labor Day Holiday weekend. “Given high absentees and low volumes, my guess is it’s going to add to volatility,” said Arone. ***** &gt; Frank Cappelleri, Nomura executive director, said he also expects volatility, and the S&amp;P could test the outer limits of its recent range. ***** &gt; Of the 17 trading days this month, nine of them saw absolute 1% moves in the S&amp;P 500. The last time that occurred was in December, when there were 10 days with 1% moves, according to Cappelleri. The most in one month was February, 2018 when there were 12.

Losses earlier in the month and gains over the past three days (prior to today) have tracked August’s typical trading pattern for over the last 21-years quite closely. The magnitude of the moves this year has been larger than average, but the pattern has been tracked.  Due to the magnitude of this year’s moves, August’s performance over the past 21-years has been plotted on the left vertical axis in the chart above and 2019 is plotted on the right. From right around mid-month or now through the end of August, the historical trend has been weaker. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have all averaged a loss in August from 1998 to 2018 and they are on track to repeat this year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/01a116327b794dfbbf5f60981adf7ef1/f81503f55cdacc93-55/s500x750/41c284d8350eac55b6e9a2b768b07a84cbed9936.jpg))**  *****  # Is a Small-Cap Labor Day Rally Coming Soon  &gt; In the below chart, forty years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e6c3b63cadd687e835cca014192dd72/fcd39e87be04620c-93/s500x750/7e0c19f7fee940a61f9ece5a88f65d53900365f3.jpg))**  &gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of Friday’s close (August 16, 2019), Russell 2000 is up 10.8% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 15.5% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.  *****  # September Almanac: No Respite in Pre-Election Years  &gt; The start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. September gets no respite from positive pre-election year forces.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e73bc3f171da163b1e601cc26081c21/773b35094e2a77db-2e/s400x600/50353a79845a11b2bdb490f6a5ae95d25a672388.jpg))**  &gt; Although the month used to open strong, S&amp;P 500 has declined eight times in the last eleven years on the first trading day. As tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (DJIA: –11.1%), 2002 (DJIA –12.4%), the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (DJIA: –6.0%) and U.S. debt ceiling debacle in 2011 (DJIA –6.0%). However, September is improving with S&amp;P 500 advancing in ten of the last 15 Septembers and DJIA climbing in nine.  *****  # Leading Indicators Signal Growth Ahead  &gt; U.S. leading indicators rebounded in July, a good sign for the durability of the expansion.  &gt; The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) rose 0.5% month over month, the biggest gain since September 2018, and above consensus expectations for a 0.3% increase. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Leading Indicators Slowing But Growing, the LEI climbed 1.6% year over year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DUqIDwl.jpg))**  &gt; The LEI, which we include as one of the “Five Forecasters” of our Recession Watch Dashboard, has yet to turn negative this cycle. The index has fallen negative year over year before all nine recessions since 1955.  &gt; “Some investors have pointed out slowing LEI growth as a reason for caution,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “However, the LEI is signaling moderate U.S. economic growth ahead, with no signs of an imminent recession.”  &gt; The LEI is calculated from 10 individual leading data sets, including weekly jobless claims, building permits, and stock prices. This year, the majority of LEI components have boosted month-over-month growth in the index, but more internationally exposed data sets have turned into net drags.  &gt; In July, 6 of 10 components rose month over month, but four components—average hours worked, manufacturers’ new orders, new orders for nondefense capital spending, and interest rate spreads—fell month over month. Historically, breadth in LEI components has deteriorated further before a recession began. In contrast, at the end of each of the past six economic cycles, more than half of the LEI components were in decline.  &gt; While evidence of slowing growth in leading indicators is disappointing, we are encouraged by what we see outside of manufacturing. Global manufacturing has been the sector hardest hit by prolonged trade tensions and weakened demand, and we don’t expect to see much improvement until a U.S.-China trade resolution is reached. Even then, a recovery in manufacturing may take some time.  *****  # Complexity Behind the Fed Rate Cut  &gt; Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) July meeting, released August 21, show the complexity of policymakers’ discussions leading up to the first rate cut of this economic cycle.  &gt; Policymakers debated what to do amid strong consumer spending, a solid labor market, tepid inflation, sluggish business investment, financial stability, global risks, and the persistent headwind of trade uncertainty. Ultimately, the Fed announced a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate reduction after a vote with two dissents (Fed presidents Esther George from Kansas City and Eric Rosengren from Boston).  &gt; The minutes also reinforced Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s description of the rate cut as a “mid-cycle adjustment,” a characterization that was especially evident from upbeat economic commentary. These rate changes, which we’ve referred to as “course corrections,” have been a feature of many economic cycles and have been more of a risk management tool in response to building risks than a response to an impending recession.  &gt; “The Fed recognized the growing need for looser policy as insurance against heightened global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Lower rates could provide a buffer if uncertainty materially weighs on growth, reducing the chances of a policy mistake or a rush to cut rates before a recession.”  &gt; Participants generally agreed that the U.S. economic outlook was solid, even though inflation had slipped a little this year. In fact, domestic economic strength was the driving force behind the two dissents. George voted against a rate cut because there were few signs of weakness in incoming data or the medium-term economic outlook. Rosengren dissented because he saw no “clear and compelling case” for rate cuts, especially given his concerns for financial stability.  &gt; The minutes, however, gave few clues on the future path of policy, and participants emphasized the importance of maintaining “optionality” with policy and basing rate decisions on incoming information.  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Investors Expect More Rate Cuts Ahead, investors are positioning for multiple 25 basis point rate cuts through the end of 2019.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PPwxsaE.png))**  &gt; We agree that one or two more 25 basis point “insurance” rate cuts could be ahead as the Fed attempts to ease pressure on the Treasury yield curve and global currencies.  *****  # Crude Oil's Descending Triangle  &gt; Earlier this week, crude oil was trading well over 2% higher than last Friday's close. Over the past few sessions, though, oil has given up all of those gains. The catalyst for today's declines are the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on US crude which are expected to dampen demand. This week's negative reversal comes as the commodity ran into multiple points of resistance. For starters, the rally began to stall out mid-week when it met the converging 200 and 50-day moving averages. This also coincided with a downtrend that traces itself all the way back to the highs from late last year. In fact, crude is down around 30% from these previous highs.  &gt; Overall, the technical picture for crude oil is not in a great place as the chart is forming a descending triangle pattern. Despite the big gains at the beginning of 2019, over the past few months, crude has been making consistent lower highs and lower lows. Given this most recent failure to retake the moving averages and break out of the downtrend, the next major support level to watch is around $50 which is a level that has held up at multiple times in the past few months. This support also draws back to late last year prior to the collapse in December.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-CL2.png))**  *****  # Yield Curves: Another Record Streak Bites the Dust  &gt; After the 3-month vs 10-year US Treasury yield curve first inverted earlier this year, the market has shifted its focus to the 2-year vs 10-year part of the curve which had yet to reach inverted levels. That was, until yesterday. While the 10s2s curve flirted with inverted territory for the last few days on an intraday basis, Thursday was the first time in more than a decade that the closing yield on the two-year US Treasury was above the yield on the 10-year. And with another closely watched part of the curve moving into inverted levels, recession fears increased.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Long-Terms.png))**  &gt; As the chart above illustrates, it has been a while since the 10s2s curve was inverted. In fact, the streak that just ended was the longest on record going back to 1977, and it wasn't even close. Going back to 1977, there have only been three prior streaks where the 10s2s curve was inverted for more than 1,000 days, and never before had the curve been positively sloped for more than 2,000 days. The current streak, though? 3,054 days. It was fun while it lasted!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Streaks.png))**  *****  # Adapt or Die  &gt; A common characteristic of most investors and traders is to always be on the lookout for patterns and connections between various asset classes. Whenever one correlated asset confirms the move in another it adds a layer of confidence to an investor's thesis. One long-held example is the Dow Transports as a leading or coincident indicator for the broader market. For decades now, many investors have followed the transports for confirmation of the broader market moves. If the transports — which move all of the physical goods in the economy — rally, it suggests that the broader market will be strong, while periods when the transports start to roll over are read as a signal that there's an underlying weakness in the economy.  &gt; As the US economy has become more service and digital-oriented in nature, there has been a valid argument made that the transports have lost some of their importance as an indicator of the broader economy. Along these lines, we have suggested that rather than transports, semiconductors may represent this century's 'transports' as they are a part of just about everything in this digital age. Whether you agree with this or not isn't important, but the important takeaway is that just because two asset classes have been highly correlated in the past doesn't mean that they will remain that way in the future. It's one thing to recognize a correlation between two asset classes, but it's much more important to understand why they are correlated and be on the lookout for factors that may change the status quo in the future.  &gt; One example of a radical change in a relationship between two asset classes is the interaction between the relative strength of growth and value stocks versus the slope of the yield curve. From 2002 through 2011, the two were closely correlated. As the curve flattened in the early part of this century, growth stocks underperformed value by a wide margin (falling blue line). Then in mid-2007, as the curve steepened and came out from inverted territory, growth stocks started to rip higher relative to value. Beginning in 2009, though, the curve stopped steepening and the relative strength of growth relative to value stalled out. The two series were so closely joined at the hip during this ten-year stretch that the correlation coefficient between the two was +0.82, which is indicative of two series moving in lockstep with each other.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2002-2019.png))**  &gt; If the paths of the yield curve and the relative strength of growth versus value couldn't be separated from 2002 through 2011, the relationship soured in 2012 when the two came down with a case of the ten-year itch. At that point, they couldn't separate fast enough. The chart below shows the same two series from the start of 2012 through the present. Now, when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa, as the paths are nearly exact opposites. In fact, in the nearly eight years since 2012, the correlation between the two is -0.90.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019.png))**  &gt; In the chart below we have shown the two series over the entire time period spanning 2002 through 2019. The non-shaded area represents the period covered in the first chart, while the shaded area covers the second period. Right around the time where the shaded period starts is when the positive correlation turned on a dime, and beginning in 2013 when the curve started to flatten, investors who were still hanging on to the idea that a flatter yield curve was a green light for value stocks, saw what turned out to be an extended period of misery relative to the performance of growth stocks. In the words of Intel Founder Andy Grove, ""Adapt or Die.""  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019-Entire-Period.png))**  *****  # Nasdaq 100 to S&amp;P 500 Ratio  &gt; Below is a chart of the Nasdaq 100 going back to 1990. While it took 15+ years for the index to make a new all-time closing high following its March 2000 peak, the index is currently 65% above those March 2000 highs.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndx100.png))**  &gt; Below is a ratio chart of the Nasdaq 100's price versus the S&amp;P 500's price since 1990. The ratio started well below 1 in early 1990 but quickly overtook the S&amp;P in price by the mid-90s. As you can see, the ratio spiked dramatically above 3 during the peak of the Dot Com bubble in late 1999. The Nasdaq 100 then gave up much of that outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 over a 2-3 year period where the ratio got all the way back down to 1, but since then it has been steadily trending higher to its current level of 2.65. While it went through a bubble and a burst over a 5-year period, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for a long time now.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndxratio.png))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 23rd, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2rknA4-2xY))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 08.25.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJ4AlGZX-E))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$BBY**  &gt; * **$MOMO**  &gt; * **$OKTA**  &gt; * **$DG**  &gt; * **$VEEV**  &gt; * **$ULTA**  &gt; * **$OSIS**  &gt; * **$BILI**  &gt; * **$DLTR**  &gt; * **$TIF**  &gt; * **$NTNX**  &gt; * **$ICLK**  &gt; * **$ADSK**  &gt; * **$SJM**  &gt; * **$PLAN**  &gt; * **$WDAY**  &gt; * **$ANF**  &gt; * **$DELL**  &gt; * **$BURL**  &gt; * **$FIVE**  &gt; * **$BWAY**  &gt; * **$JT**  &gt; * **$MRVL**  &gt; * **$BNS**  &gt; * **$BMO**  &gt; * **$HPE**  &gt; * **$COTY**  &gt; * **$TD**  &gt; * **$ITRN**  &gt; * **$HEI**  &gt; * **$EXPR**  &gt; * **$JILL**  &gt; * **$WMWD**  &gt; * **$MOGU**  &gt; * **$CAL**  &gt; * **$GES**  &gt; * **$CPB**  &gt; * **$BOX**  &gt; * **$PVH**  &gt; * **$BIG**  &gt; * **$CHS**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/REAFEsy.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGKM5Yy.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/fykWlTA.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 8.26.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/upLUSDf.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 8.26.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rWA27c1.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 8.27.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XsN2sKT.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 8.27.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9IGFOzk.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 8.28.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TrocNxW.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 8.28.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/btW54ZZ.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 8.29.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rN4q8iu.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 8.29.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SVcDLmB.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 8.30.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AV8pPua.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 8.30.19 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # DISCUSS!

After doing so, I realized I had no idea why I did that and decided to read the report after spending my money. Here's a summary of the first 7 pages. Everything after the first 7 pages is the data and write-ups on how they found the data and their interpretations of that data that lead them to the conclusions they outline. I have no real financial experience or expertise and didn't understand most of what I read. You're welcome.  \----   **GE Is Hiding $29 Billion ($29B) in Long-Term Care Losses**      (Get used to the acronym LTC) according to this report. He lists off 3 ""Key Risks to GE's survival"".    1. recession (Bear gang)   2. in 2021 GE will cease to have any positive cash flow. while simultaneously taking a $29B reserve hit for it's LTC liabilities. (Specifically Q1 2021)    3. Assuming they survive both listed above, it will then have to repay $107B in debt, cover its $27B in pension liabilities.  (Note: He claims that GE has no cash and only earned $14.9B over last 7-years and these liabilities total over $160B)     He then goes on to state that GE LTC situation is similar to AIG's Financial Products Corporation, which destroyed AIG. Compares AIG enjoying ""earnings"" as GE has reported. GE Capital (GEC) accounted for LTC insurance premiums in their earnings in the 1980's, 90's, and 2000's while also not funding adequate reserves to offset the LTC liabilities.      So far, 14% f LTC claims being filed has lead to a $15B reserve hit, 86.2% remain. ""GE’s LTC losses will   continue rising at an exponential rate until it either files for bankruptcy protection or finds some way to out-earn its   LTC liabilities."" They looked at the accounting by accessing and analyzing the SAP (statutory accounting rules) filings from the LTC insurers who were reinsuring with GE-ERAC showed them how much GE was losing each year. They found exponentially growing losses that they claim will bleed GE of additional cash such that GE is unlikely to become cash positive in 2021 and beyond (buzz lightyear voice).      They analyzed GE's 7 largest reinsurance deals, which account for approx. 95% of GE's total LTC reinsurance liabilities. They also analyzed GE's own reinsurer LifeCare. (You can see details on each reinsurance deal in Appendix I of the report) They provide notes throughout the report on how you can track down the reports/data yourself if you don't believe them.      They calculated GE should have taken a reserve hit as early as 2012, but no later than 2015. Instead GE waited for new management to come in and book what little reserve they could afford in late 2017/early 2018, a $15B commitment which required a special exemption from the Kansas Insurance Department (KID) to spread over a 7-year period because GE isn't liquid right now and likely won't survive long enough to make their last few years of reserve payments anyway.     GE’s $15 Billion LTC reserve hit was a nasty market surprise and it’s about to get $29 Billion worse.     While looking through the analysis, ask yourself 3 questions:    1. Who's being transparent - GE or them   2. Who's showing GE's reinsurance losses by carrier by year, by dollar amount - GE or them   3. Who's accounting do you trust more?     They show a comparison of GE to a responsible insurance carrier such as Prudential (PRU), GE needs $18.5B in additional reserves in order to be able to pay claims. GE also has a $10.5B difference between its $30.4B in statutory reserves and it's $19.9B of GAAP reserves. This difference will lead to a non-cash charge to earnings between now and the new insurance accounting rule change, which goes into effect in 1QTR 2021. This policy will result in a $10.5B hit to GE's shareholder equity cushion and put its credit rating and debt covenants at grave risk.      ""To summarize, GE is hiding $29 Billion in additional   LTC losses from investors and our Whistleblower Report will walk you through the details using figures provided by eight   of GE’s LTC counter-parties. Either those eight companies are lying and reporting false data or GE is.""     They end the LTC section with 2 questions for GE's management of LTC:   1. Make your agreements public   2. provide your LTC actuarial assumptions    (neither of which are questions)   \-----   **GE Is Hiding $9.1 Billion in Baker Hughes Losses**     GE's 2017 investment in Baker Hughes was bad and forced them to exit that investment in November 2018 when they sold 101.2 million BHGE shares in a secondary offering. GE booked a $2.2B pre-tax loss from that sale. GE then continued to account for it's shares in BHGE as a Non-Controlling Interest in 2018, despite the holding now strictly being an investment. If they had treated it as an investment, as accounting rules require, it would have incurred a $9.1B loss.      \------   **Why Didn’t GE Disclose Its Working Capital of Minus $20.3B and Its Current Ratio of .67?**     ""The same $52B of Baker Hughes assets and $22B of revenues are reported on both GE’s 2018 financial statements   and BHGE’s where in reality, only one entity, BHGE actually controls these assets and cash flows. Backing out BHGE’s   cash flow from operating activities (CFOA) reduces GE’s 2018 CFOA from $2.257B to a meager $495M.""     ""GE’s 2018 year-ending working capital was minus $14.3B with BHGE and minus $20.3B without!"" GE then wilfully omitted working capital reports and disclosures in their 10-K and only discusses changes in working capital, but never gives you a true picture of their dire financial position. Provided in the report are working capital schedules for GE both with and without BGGE (Slide 104).     GE's current ratio is a stunningly low .67. The current ratio is not listed in GE's 2018 10-K so this is a number they had to calculate themselves.    Final 3 questions for KPMG, GE's auditors dating back to 1909:   1. What did you know?   2. When did you know it?   3. Where's your ""Going Concern Opinion?""     \-----     The remainder of the report goes into how they analyzed GE and discovered the Fraud and the cues that have been missed by investors and analysts. Concluding remark that I thought was important to humanize the extent of this fraud:   ""I want to express my sympathy to the one million people who count on GE for either salaries, healthcare, or   pensions. Make no mistake, GE’s current and past employees are the victims here as are GE’s lenders, vendors, and   customers all of whom have to deal with the aftermath of an accounting fraud. The only winners are GE’s fat cat   executives who enriched themselves with undeserved bonuses as they drove this once proud beacon of American   business into the ground. I encourage you to hold them accountable.   Thank you very much for taking the time to read our Whistleblower Report, we hope you find it informative.   Harry Markopolos, CFA®, CFE""     After this is over 160 pages of data and reports with notes on how to find those reports yourself if you don't trust them on it.    \----  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR - GE is going to GEt fucked.

Real life ironman - ￼￼￼￼ , has finally announced why he’s stepped back from Tesla and SpaceX, his most beloved companies. His new venture, called￼￼￼ has seen ￼￼ invest over 2 billion dollars in just the past 2 years - to develop and code ￼￼￼ .  Before we go into the details of what ￼￼￼ is, let’s talk about who ￼￼￼￼ is. ￼￼ ￼￼ is a visionary. Some call him the smartest entrepreneur of our century. He believes in renewable energy, living in Mars, and pushing the envelope of what’s possible. Although his ideas often seem too radical and impossible to many people, ￼￼ is proving them wrong year after year. He has made it his agenda to make the world greener and bring humankind to new possibilities. Some of his ventures include PayPal, Tesla, Boring Company and now OpenAI.  But now, ￼￼ has decided to partly withdraw from running Tesla and SpaceX, in order to focus on his new venture in the financial sector. That's why he’s acquired ￼￼￼ .  What exactly is ￼￼￼ ? ￼￼￼is an upgrade from computers as you know them. In fact, ￼￼ beat IBM, Microsoft and few others who have been developing this form of computing for years to the punch. This is not just a super-computer – it’s a hyper-computer on steroids.  ￼  ￼  1/39 ￼￼￼ Computer Being Built - February of 2018  If you were to take ALL of the world's computers and link them, Q￼￼mAIwould still be hundreds of times more powerful. ￼￼ decided to put all of this power to work in a financial technology with the plan of redistributing the world’s wealth.  Basically, to take from the top 0.1% and give back to the 99.9%. ￼￼ believes wealth is not distributed well in our time and the problem is getting worse. Although there will always be someone richer and someone poorer, the current situation is unacceptable – where the top 0.1% controls almost 90% of world's wealth. He believes he can cut that down to around 20% without causing world-wide financial crisis. So, what exactly does that mean to you, just a regular person? This means you’ll become 2 - 3 times wealthier, and no one except the super-wealthy will take a hit. Sounds amazing, doesn't it? Not for the super-wealthy, but for you – yes!  Ok, the theory is there, but how will it work you might ask?  Overall, the idea is easy. The top 0.1% keep their wealth invested in ￼￼s, and Wa￼et bro￼s trade these￼￼s for them. The idea is to beat the Wa￼et traders at their own game - making winning trades so Wa￼etwith their hoard of wealth slowly but surely starts losing. Just like a poker game, where a new player comes along on the high-stakes table and starts winning.  ￼  ￼  ￼￼￼ Fleet of 39 Total Q-Computers  In order to do this normally, you’d need a better ￼￼ movement predictions than what Wa￼et currently has (virtually impossible).  Now, with the help of Q￼￼computing, it can be done, and it's actually being done now as ￼￼￼has shown! This is exactly the reason why ￼￼ jumped on this technology as soon as he heard about it. It's revolutionary.  We interviewed Q￼￼AI CTO Daniel Powers so he can better explain how Q￼￼AI operates.  ￼  Can you tell us how ￼￼￼works?  Q￼￼mAI works like a team of hundreds of cities. We have millions of automated citizens in each city that go in to ￼￼ markets, they spend 12 hours a day gathering information. In the evening, these ‘cities’ come together to exchange and compare what they gathered. Then what we call ‘kings of the cities’ analyze all information and try to find mistakes in the ￼￼ market; by finding a mistake, we can predict the ￼￼ trends. Once we have a certain trending topic related to a big company, we analyze if the trend is positive or negative.  If the trend is positive, we bet on the ￼￼ to rise, if the trend is negative - we bet on the ￼￼ to fall. It’s that simple.  How often does ￼￼￼make a mistake?  Depends how you think about it. Q￼￼ computing is very different to everyday PCs. If a normal computer has one or two CPUs(processor), then Q￼￼AI consists of millions of CPUs. If a mistake is made, the CPUs analyze the outcome and ""VOTE"" which decision is the mistake and which is the real deal.We are still in the Beta stage of our q￼￼m computer and software, but it’s already showing over 91% successful trades. This means that out of 100 trades Q￼￼AI makes automatically, around 91 will be profitable.  How much ￼￼ can a regular user of ￼￼￼make?  It depends a lot on the ￼￼they invest and the ￼￼s they work with. Let’s take the regular user who starts with 400 € and bets 10€ per trade. Over 24 hours, Q￼￼AI will make around 200 trades based(this is limited by user) on information gathered by Q￼￼AI. Around 182 of the trades will be profitable, 18 will not. This means the user will earn approximately 3,000€ and lose around 450€. Evening out to 2,602€ profit in a single day. There are some small commissions added by the bro￼, but it’s usually less than 2%.  Has any user actually lost his investment?  No, we have never had a user who has lost more than he put in. Even the worst cases we have had always been profitable in the end.  What improvements are you working on right now?  There are many we’re currently working on, but ￼￼ insisted I not share them yet. Stay tuned though – it’s going to get even better than it already is now!  How much will it cost to use ￼￼￼ automated system?  We don’t know yet – it fully depends on running costs and where we want to take the technology. But the first 1,000 spots will be free – we want people to help us test it (and make ￼￼ while they do so). After that, for regular users, we’re thinking of charging 8,000€ monthly and more than ten times as much for those trading firms who wish to use Q￼￼AIregularly across their business. We do not want to disrupt the ￼￼market too much so spots will be limited to 500 trading firms and 50,000 regular users.  When will ￼￼￼ be available?  Very soon. We’re just adding finishing touches and the first members will be welcome very soon. First, we’ll open the doors for small traders - regular people, and only later for big trading firms. Again, the first 1,000 people will get a lifetime membership for free.  After the interview Daniel showed us ￼￼￼ in action. It was like seeing a real miracle taking place before our eyes. Daniel’s software was making ￼￼ on autopilot. Daniel was so confident in his software in partnership with Q￼￼AI, that he offered to give us one free membership so we could run our own independent tests, and so we did.  ￼Alex Woods, 44  We took one of our intern students, Alex Woods, and told him to sign up, following each step provided by Daniel.  The first step was easy - he needed to fill in some details like his name, last name, email and phone number. After the form was completed and submitted, he was taken to ￼￼￼ dashboard. Everything seemed pretty easy so far.  The next step was to fund the trading account with a trusted bro￼. Q￼￼AI selected verified bro￼ for Alex. As we were navigating to the deposit page, Alex received a phone call from his personal account manager wanting to assist in the funding and setup process. With the help of his account manager, the funding process didn’t take long, as all major Credit Cards like VISA, MasterCard and American Express were accepted. Alex went ahead and deposited 220€. Once funded, we navigated to the “Auto Trader” section of software, set the trade amount to recommended ”Auto-Optimize-Bidding” for highest profits.  Q￼￼AI started making trades automatically in front of our eyes, winning most of them. We left it active for 23 hours and once we came back, Alex already had 2,278.95€ in his account.

When you hear about those first 1,000 people making ￼￼ without paying massive fees for trading, you’ll regret it. Avoid that, and sign up when it goes live.  UPDATE  It’s happened!

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 27th, 2019.  # **Trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/trade-and-the-economy-have-become-the-new-roller-coaster-for-markets.html)** ***** &gt; Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy. ***** &gt; Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market’s move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year. ***** &gt; “There’s not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,” said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.” ***** &gt; Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others. ***** &gt; As for trade, Chandler said it’s possible that President Donald Trump’s comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment. ***** &gt; “In some ways, it’s a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,” said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. “China thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.” ***** &gt; She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China’s military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature program. ***** &gt; “It’s now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: ‘We’re going against the U.S. and we’ve got to be in it for the long haul.’ I don’t think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don’t have the same nationalistic pride to say ‘we have to fight China at all cost,’” she said. ***** &gt; In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy. ***** &gt; Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday. ***** &gt; J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment. ***** &gt; “The concerns the markets have right now are that we’re moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “If that’s the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.” ***** &gt; The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed’s target of 2% inflation. ***** &gt; Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next. ***** &gt; Solstein Capital’s Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer. ***** &gt; She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates. ***** &gt; “People are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,” Terman said. ***** &gt; Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold. ***** &gt; “What would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,” she said. ***** &gt; There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General. ***** &gt; Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/YB7FVVl.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/tsse5wM.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Jx099zV.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Noafctx.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mDkvHkf.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FLUiLS1.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7bYwEj2.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SiGqWZH.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L2rlfZK.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FNFloqg.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qhHZ79X.png))**  *****  # S&amp;P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day  &gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.  &gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e49bc44dc78f0206988b762ef5ea68ad/tumblr_inline_ps0eqveTDc1spdppr_640.jpg))**  *****  # The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative  &gt; Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say ""All in.""  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/rate-odds.png))**  *****  # Fed Members Side With “Transitory” Inflation  &gt; Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers’ views of inflation.  &gt; Minutes of the Fed’s most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that “many participants” considered slowing consumer inflation as “transitory,” and agreed that the Fed’s current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers’ optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.  &gt; Markets think the grace period for a “transitory” excuse has passed, but data show it’s too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas’s “trimmed mean” PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “It’s tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “If consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate.”  &gt; Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed’s last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.  &gt; Overall, we don’t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it’s becoming more obvious the Fed doesn’t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.  *****  # Another Reason For Bulls To Smile  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.  &gt; Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.  &gt; “Although we wouldn’t be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!”  &gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns—10% versus 4.7%—following four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There’s always a catch though, and in this case we’ve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-Strong-Start-To-A-Year-Has-Bulls-Smiling.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # Earnings Season Takeaways  &gt; We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&amp;P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4–5% drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&amp;P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.  &gt; Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.  &gt; “Escalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,” said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China’s President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.”  &gt; Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3–4% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&amp;P 500 fair value target of 3,000—though it probably won’t get there in a straight line.  *****  # Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best  &gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (–0.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.  &gt; In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57d94e8a408ad305588ab0473f6f28ec/tumblr_inline_prz1z7mpgq1spdppr_400.jpg))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for May 24th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VglIB3aJTjA))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 05.26.19**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0SBMubBDW0))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$NIO**  &gt; * **$MOMO**  &gt; * **$GOOS**  &gt; * **$COST**  &gt; * **$PANW**  &gt; * **$ZS**  &gt; * **$OKTA**  &gt; * **$WDAY**  &gt; * **$NTNX**  &gt; * **$ULTA**  &gt; * **$DKS**  &gt; * **$VEEV**  &gt; * **$ANF**  &gt; * **$BZUN**  &gt; * **$DG**  &gt; * **$DLTR**  &gt; * **$BNS**  &gt; * **$YY**  &gt; * **$MRVL**  &gt; * **$ASND**  &gt; * **$CSIQ**  &gt; * **$CPRI**  &gt; * **$BAH**  &gt; * **$BURL**  &gt; * **$VMW**  &gt; * **$AMWD**  &gt; * **$KEYS**  &gt; * **$ZUO**  &gt; * **$BMO**  &gt; * **$PLAN**  &gt; * **$JT**  &gt; * **$HEI**  &gt; * **$GPS**  &gt; * **$NXGN**  &gt; * **$PVH**  &gt; * **$QTNT**  &gt; * **$NM**  &gt; * **$EXPR**  &gt; * **$SAFM**  &gt; * **$BITA**  &gt; * **$CMCO**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/L2rlfZK.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TW37RkL.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/9gVUm6y.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 5.27.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.

Lost it all. I took out a second personal loan for 20k. Lost it all. I took out a 3rd personal loan for 35k and managed to make back all my money.  Moral of the story, keep borrowing until you get it right.   &amp;#x200B;  Good afternoon my fellow Autists,  &amp;#x200B;  I decided to make a post about the perils of options and stocks. I started options trading last summer while watching MU gains and MU profit porn. I jumped in with about 2.5k (which came from a reimbursement check from work). So rather than pay off my credit cards with it, I'm like, ""Let's see if I can turn this into some big gains!"" Well, I turned it into 5k and was super excited. Queue ""Stormy Weather"" and a substantial loss. Well shit. Here comes another reimbursement check, let's see if I can double down. Queue a shitty earnings report. So I took my losses, transferred what I was supposed to pay my reimbursement checks towards to a 0% interest credit card for 18 months and am currently paying that shit down. I took a break from stocks in general for awhile, until the imfamous December 24th period.  &amp;#x200B;  My dad had just given me 300$ for Christmas, and I transferred that and 100$ into my Robinhood account. Decided to buy calls on SPY on the 26th and instantly got 400% gains and was realized it was super easy. I thought to myself, ""Only if I had more money, this could have been substantial!"" So, I was in calls for a bit, riding the trend upward, but was drinking the bear kool-aid, and kept losing money here and there on puts. And finally, I log into my American Express account and see I pre-qualify for a personal loan of up to 15k. Now, at first I'm like, ""That's a stupid idea."" I've read your warnings, I've seen the loss porn, and all that jazz and thought, ""Nah."" Well, it pops up a few times, and at this point, I'm making some good moves, but my account is still less than $5,000. I've been playing AMZN when it was swinging between 1600 and 1700, making a double amount here and there, but I wanted more. So finally, I dip my toes into it and sign up for 12k personal loan from AMEX. My goal here was to buy AMZN calls when it was around $1600. I did - and made a few thousand, but my total losses from all time was around 23k. I ended up losing the majority of that personal loan trying to time the top. So I did what any autist does, and kept doubling down on some stuff. I took out another personal loan through Lendingclub for about 20k+1600$ origination fee. After that, I did my riskiest play to date (other than gambling) was buying 25k worth of weekly NFLX 370$ calls and selling them for 31K. That was awesome. But that got me banned from Robinhood due to day trading and not finishing above 25k. (Just prior to this, I had 20k with of IWM puts when it was 158, expiring 2 weeks out. If would have held, they would have been worth 90k+ when it dropped to 151 the following week.) So I was mad at myself for that and wanted to make another big play.  &amp;#x200B;  I transfer my money into my etrade account, and while I wait for funds to settle, I'm watching AMZN rise from low 1600s. If I could trade in Robinhood or had my money been settled there, I would have all in'd some weekly AMZN calls. I had to watch it rise to the 1700s and miss out. I wanted revenge. Queue that Monday when SPY rose from 271 to 278 in a single day. I did the autismo thing and bought weekly puts near open when it was 274 and watched 20k turn into 10k in a single day. I wasn't worried - it has to go down eventually right? Nope. So, I sold my puts and my account value turned into about 2k. I now worked on a strategy to earn back my money. After calculating how much I could afford in monthly payments, bills, and what not, I calculated I could take on one more personal loan payment. I wouldn't be as retarded this time, though. I got rejected from a couple of places, but SoFi - bless their retarded souls, decided they would give me a 35k personal loan. Had I not been approved of this personal loan, I would have cut my losses and just accepted my fate of 3 years worth of personal loan payments. A few days later, 35k landed in my account. I paid off some of my other personal loans, through some money into savings, and transferred about 30k in Etrade. I swore off weeklies.   &amp;#x200B;  I purchased about 30k worth of $BB stock and JAN 2020 calls prior to their earnings and made about 20k. I sold some for profit on that day, and lost about 10k the next day when it decided to drop. I pulled out about 5k, made some payments, and then tried to play AMZN and NFLX again, and lost about 5k there, but I didn't gamble the whole farm.  &amp;#x200B;  Three weeks ago, I stumbled on ""I pick stocks and options so you don't have to"", and read through it. I decided to follow u/SoRefreshing on his TWTR play and bought some $36 strike and $41 strike calls for June 21st for a total of 27k. The day before earnings, Monday of this week, my account value sat at 19k and I was down 8k from that play. Earnings came out and I hit a high that day of 52k that day, and ended up around 48k. I sold some for profit, withdrew some money, and let it sit a day. Next day rolled around, I said fuck it, sold  75% of the rest, rolled others out to September, and bought some $FB stock and 5k worth of calls.   &amp;#x200B;  Yesterday, around 2 PM, I decided one more yolo, and through everything (except 15k worth of TWTR Sep calls) into $FB calls. Today, I consider myself lucky. Hope you enjoyed my retardation.   &amp;#x200B;  This morning, I withdrew about 10k from my account, sold some stuff off, repositioned some things, and now I'm sitting at around 73k in my etrade account.   Here is proof.

Obamacare uncertainty, Medicare for All propositions by most democratic candidates, drug price control measures, drug rebates, etc. In fact, it is foolish to even write this post. But there is upside here people maybe overlooking and that is why I am posting this DD in this sub and not a responsible one.   [On Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group reports their earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-unitedhealth-unh-earnings-135701718.html). UNH will be the first healthcare provider to report this quarter and I believe its guidance can potentially reverse the entire sector. UNH and providers like it are in unique positions. They never had the ability to recover from the December dip, only falling lower from December lows when Medicare for All rumors started in January and a [bill was introduced in February](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384/text). On April 10th [Bernie Sanders introduced his own Medicare for All bill](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-bernie-sanders-says-he-would-fund-medicare-for-all-2019-04-10). Predictably, all of these stocks plummeted even more after modest March gains with Friday drops of 5-8% for most stocks. [UNH saw its biggest 2-day selloff in 10 years in wake of Bernie Sanders' health plan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/unitedhealths-stock-suffering-biggest-2-day-selloff-in-10-years-in-wake-of-bernie-sanders-health-plan-2019-04-12). There is a very small chance any of this will ever be law yet here we are. [Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi doesnt even like Medicare for All](https://splinternews.com/healthcare-lobbyist-tells-other-goblins-that-pelosi-won-1834008350).  That said there are only a handful of providers publicly traded and each feed off of each other. That is why UNH’s earnings will have huge implications for the sector.  These stocks have been kept down on fear despite revenue and earnings growth. Any positive assurance by UNH could send the whole sector flying. Most stocks are down 25-30% from 52-week highs set in December (pre-dip) and will have room to run if reversal happens. This is a complete gamble but the upside is there. Will the rumors of medicare for all keep going? Does a bear shit in the woods? 2020 primary debates will be starting soon so I am not saying to hold long but a post-UNH calls are just the right amount upside to lose all your money on.    I like $CI, $MOH, $ANTM calls here. Relatively low p/e’s, decent profit margins for the sector, RSI’s under 40, and earnings late enough in April/May to avoid paying premiums on calls. $CI has a [partnership with Amazon](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/371496/cigna-express-scripts-join-amazon-alexa-for-new-voice-skills) and [acquired Express Scripts in December](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20181220/NEWS/181229999/cigna-and-express-scripts-close-on-67-billion-merger). Again, tremendous risk, and I have no idea why I bother to write this. Its pure negligence but a juicy opportunity amidst panic in the streets. You're essentially gambling that UNH’s earnings and guidance to be good enough to reverse the entire sector’s downtrend. It is a huge task for UNH and they will need to knock it out of the park. You can bet on UNH earnings but the premiums might be too high for the tremendous risk involved.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|537682.0|public|confidence|self|Buying the Healthcare Provider Dip Ahead of Tuesday: An Incredibly Reckless Thought Only a Complete Degenerate Would Consider but Maybe Has Some Potential||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bcufzd/buying_the_healthcare_provider_dip_ahead_of/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||1555271362.0|||||||||||2019-04-13|EXPR

The company’s main business segments include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx freight, and FedEx services. FedEx Express makes up 57.4% of revenue, but only 45.2% of operating income. This segment credits itself as the largest express transportation company in the world, reaching over 220 countries and territories. FedEx Ground is responsible for 29.2% of top line, which converts to 45.7% of operating income. This segment delivers to US and Canadian businesses, and can reach 100% of continental US residents. FedEx freight earns 10.8% of revenue, and includes freight services of any length. FedEx services controls 2.6% of revenue, and includes various business services to support the company’s transportation services. The business currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 10.4x, representing a 29.12% discount to the company’s 1 year average multiple of 14.8x. The main reasons for the selloff is slower integration with the TNT Express acquisition, slowdowns in global economies, and competition from Amazon, which as explained below, is completely overblown.   FDX acquired TNT Express, an air and delivery services company, providing FDX with exposure to a deep European and Asian network. In FY’17, FDX announced a profit improvement goal of TNT of $1.2B to $1.5B between 2017 and 2020. In the company’s 2Q’19 earnings release, management noted this goal would not be reached, but still provided positive news regarding the integration process. At the time of the 2Q’19 call, 70% of the global sales force had been integrated, and the freight products and specialty services segments are growing rapidly. One reason for failing to miss the profit improvement target is a cyber attack the company faced in 2017. The Petya attack cost FDX $300mm in earnings, but since this attack was a one-time event that was not a result of weak business, I don’t think it deserves to damage the market value of FDX. Another reason for investor worries around this integration are high integration program expenses of $1.5B through 2020, which will include $450mm in FY’19. FDX is utilizing productivity-enhancing tools (bots, analytics, AI, etc.) to reduce the number of staff positions needed between the FDX and TNT. These high integration costs will likely be the last FDX has to pay, and they might decrease depending on the amount of positions cut. Finally, the global growth slowdown is a likely reason for the lower confidence in the business, which is explained more below.       Another reason for the extremely discounted P/E multiple is from concerns around the recent global economic slowdown. There is no denying the economic uncertainty economies around the world have been facing. Brexit has created economic uncertainty in the UK, Eurozone growth slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to under 2% in 1H’18, emerging Asian growth has slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2Q’18, world trade grew 3.5% in 2Q’18, compared with 5.3% growth in the same period a year earlier. Italy and Germany are dealing with slowing GDP, and the entire global economy has dealt with the trade tensions between the US and China. International revenue makes up ~33.4% of revenue, so does FXD deserve to trade at a lower multiple? Sure. But does this justify a nearly 30% discount? I don’t think so. The segment most exposed to international revenue is the FedEx Express segment, which is made up of 56.4% international revenue. Even with the global political slowdown, this segment’s revenue grew 5.8% in 2Q’18 compared to the same period a year earlier. This segment has also grown at a 1.4% compounded quarterly growth rate, showing there is still financial strength amid slowing demand. Investors also overlooked the other three segments, which have seen tremendous strength from a strong US economy, and make up over half of the company’s revenue. This growth was fueled from a 4.9% increase in General Rate Increases (GRI) for the Ground and Express segments, and a 5.9% GRI increase in the company's Freight segment. Overall I think the global economic slowdown justifies a declining P/E multiple, but not a decline as large as what FDX experienced.       Another reason for the discounted multiple is competition from Amazon, who has expressed interest to enter the logistics business. AMZN announced a 50 plane expansion to its Amazon Air fleet, and a $1.5B operating hub scheduled to open in Kentucky in 2021 with capacity for 100 planes. The company already handles 26% of its shipment centers and 185 fulfillment centers, and some analysts think its recent growth plans will cut into FDX’s market share. I think it is a ridiculous claim to compare AMZN as a legitimate competitor to FDX, and does not warrant a declined multiple. FDX recently stated AMZN accounted for less than 1.3% of calendar 2018 revenue, and is not a significant threat. Additionally, FDX’s history is made up of a series of purchases and acquisitions to build one of the most intricate global networks. If anyone thinks AMZN becomes a serious competitor when why buy a few planes and open 1 operating hub, they’re simply crazy. AMZN will not be a significant competitor in the short run, and any uncertainty around this news is completely overblown.       FDX is also implementing multiple initiatives to insure its multiple trades back to fair value. FDX announced FedEx Extra Hours, a service that delivers products after regular operating hours for next day delivery and local two day deliveries. Customers already include  AutoZone and Best Buy, with plans to expand to more retailers. The company is growing FedEx OnSite, a service that allows customers and FDX associates to pick up and drop off packages through a retail outlet. This service is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including 8,900 Walgreens stores, helping the company utilize the growing e-commerce market to attract customers. I am also confident FDX’s large market share, increasing efficiency measures, expanding operations, and strong financial history will help it retain its customer base and growing sales.       For 3Q’18, analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $3.14, representing a (15.6%) YoY decline. This value has been revised downward by (1.64%) in the last four weeks. Revenue is expected to come in a $17.7B, accounting for a 6.9% (nice) YoY increase. My overall consensus is that FDX’s multiple was unfairly sold off in 2018, and I would buy calls long term. For earnings after the bell on Tuesday (3/16), this is a literal bet. I think investors will focus on management guidance for the integration with TNT Express, and see how financials have been impacted from the global slowdown. Since the stock is trading at such a discount, I don’t think investors are looking for much, but weak guidance could still have severe impacts. I’m probably going with calls, or I might wait until after earnings to buy calls. Let me know what you guys are thinking.   TDLR: I probably won’t play earnings, but will consider calls depending on the management call.   Sorry there aren’t any links or sources.

I find it offensive. If you were to create a word-cloud visualization of the language used on wsb, I bet “investor” is largely absent or in the very fine print.  And that’s because no one pretends wsb is an investment forum.  Investment forums are fucking boring.  Jack Bogle and all that shit. Diversification and low-fee indexes. Fucking AOL shit.  So when Charlie Munger, the co-godfather of boring-ass value investing says “I would be comfortable putting 100% of my net-worth into one stock”, what the fuck does that mean?  I mean, he’s old as fuck so maybe that’s just ancient crazy talk. I mean, way back in our Magnavox black-and-white vacuum tube history, before algo trading and 401K’s and QE, the market was way easier, right?  Back in those days, you could buy a railroad stock in a booming economy growing 30% a year and throwing off shitloads of free cash flow at a PE of 2.  Well duh, I’d do that too.  But today, with the S&amp;amp;P500 at an all-time high, trading at a PE of 17, with Washington all kinds of fucked up, North Korea and Brexit and all that, no way is that motherfucker putting all his money in one stock.  Except he did. Well, Munger and his business partner, Warren Buffett, did.  And here’s how i think it went down:  Way the fuck back when, in 1846 to be exact, Henry Wells and William Fargo (yeah, the same guys) founded a company focused on transporting goods and valuables between NYC and Buffalo. The civil war made the transporting of valuable shit a good-ass business and so over the years, Wells and Fargo expanded their routes and bought a bunch of other companies, all of which were eventually consolidated under the brand of American Express in 1850.  Over the years, AMEX grew and by 1963, they were doing all kinds of shit but this was pre bitcoin and pre Visa/Mastercard, and the credit card business was new and a very tiny percentage of their revenue. Mostly, AMEX made money selling travelers checks and money orders to businesses.  By 1955, while AMEX was busy hustling money, a con man by the name of Anthony De Angelis started a company called Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Co to take advantage of a US government program to sell excess food to Europe for cheap.  This was shortly after WW2 and the American’s knew pissed off and hungry Europeans started wars, so they were throwing money at shysters like De Angelis to do their part for world peace.   By 1960, De Angelis was balling and he soon realized he can drive up vegetable oil prices by buying up futures, thereby increasing profits on top of his already government subsidized profits, and so by 1963 he comes up with a plan to corner the vegetable oil market and he starts buying up and storing as much of the shit as he could get his greedy little hands on.  About this time, AMEX gets into the business of guaranteeing the value of assets stocked in warehouses, so that shysters like De Angelis could take these guarantees to the banks and borrow more money to buy more inventory to drive up prices and make more money.  It was a very, very small part of AMEX’s business and as fucking crazy as it sounds, the contracts AMEX wrote didn’t require them to cover any losses associated with the inventory they guaranteed.  They just promised.  By 1963, De Angelis figures, fuck buying vegetable oil.  If I can show the world I own all the motherfucking vegetable oil in existence, and if AMEX and others say my shits real, I could be the fucking OPEC of fried chicken.  But why go through the hassle of buying vegetable oil.  Instead, I’ll just pocket most of the money I borrow from the banks, buy a shit ton of oil drums, fill them 95% full of sea water, and then top them off with a little vegetable oil.  And that’s what he did.  Seriously, I could not make this shit up.  But sometime that year, an anonymous tipster known only as “the voice” calls the oil inspectors and tells them to go check out drum number 6006.  And sho ‘nuff, drum number 6006 would not be frying extra crispy anytime soon.   But AMEX was a big, diversified business, and although their stock tanks when the story breaks, dropping from $65 to $35 in 1964, it’s still trading at a multiple of 16X earnings.    Enter Warren Buffett.  You can read up on the dude elsewhere but his greatness is not exaggerated.  There has never been and may never be a value investor like Buffett.  Buffett reads the stories like everyone else and then tells his investors he is going to put 40% of his entire fund into AMEX stock to buy 5% of the company. They were like, ‘the fuck you are.  But he does, and the question is why?  There was a scandal, no doubt, but at 17x earnings, it was no fire sale, the country was still dealing with JFK’s assassination, the shit was still pretty hot with the Russians, and no one was lining up to buy the stock.  This wasn’t anywhere near the kind of give-aways that he bought up after 2008 and yet he basically went all-in, risking his future and almost half of his investors’ money on what didn’t seem anything close to a sure thing.  He was alone on this.  Here’s why: Buffett dug deep into the AMEX’s financials and saw that they were not technically liable for any of the losses on the oil swindle.  At the same time, this whole credit card thing seemed like a promising business and doctors back in Omaha were still charging steaks to their green cards.  Meanwhile, they had cash on hand of about $250m, real assets of around $1B, and total liabilities of around $950m.  Unlike banks, they didn’t have the huge overhead of branches, and with all these money orders and traveler checks trading hands, they had a constant “float” of money to invest or about $78m.  They also had a CEO who got them out of the shittier businesses they were in, invested deep in the brand and the green card, and was on top of his shit. Unless AMEX shut their doors, this was gonna pass and pass fast.  So Buffett goes all-in and the stock increases 10X between 1964 and 1973.   It takes balls to buy cheap when blood is running in the streets.  But to “invest” like this, well that’s it’s own kind of yolo shit and much hespect to gangster Buffett.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|518135.0|public|confidence|self|Urban Trade Breakdowns: Buffett’s 1963 American Express Investment||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b23v0r/urban_trade_breakdowns_buffetts_1963_american/|house_only|1.0||||||||||||1554173752.0|||||||||||2019-03-17|EXPR

I've also heard that the uppers of the board are trying to artificially inflate the stock by cutting employees, not repairing, maintaining, or replacing equipment, (I've seen trains just outright explode while moving), firing staff willy-nilly, removing jobs for certain companies and even giving jobs to the BN --- they're inflating the stock to a certain point, then they're going to dump it and bounce while everyone else drowns.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|516441.0|public|confidence|self|Watch for Union Pacific to go down in the next couple years.||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0vk4h/watch_for_union_pacific_to_go_down_in_the_next/|house_only|1.0||||||||||||1554105715.0|||||||||||2019-03-14|EXPR

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 11th, 2019.  # **Week Ahead: After mysterious lack of new jobs, slew of US data will be a big deal  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/08/week-ahead-after-mysterious-lack-of-new-jobs-slew-of-us-data-will-be-a-big-deal.html)** ***** &gt; Economic data could trump all else in the week ahead, after hiring in February appeared to fall off a cliff, raising new concerns about the economy. ***** &gt; January's delayed retail sales report, durable goods and February's CPI inflation data all take on added significance, particularly since there has been a mixed stream of economic data lately. ***** &gt; The report Friday of just 20,000 nonfarm payrolls created in February was shockingly weak, compared to the expected 180,000 jobs. The data reflected slower growth, but also possible ill effects of bad weather, the government shutdown and other statistical abnormalities. ***** &gt; But economists, while doubting the report, also said they are paying close attention to incoming data for signs the report is either an outlier or the beginning of a broader more negative trend. ***** &gt; ""You go from 310,000 jobs to 20,000. That doesn't seem logical,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. "" I think we look back over the past few months and we had that very disappointing December retail sales number. That seemed a bit of a fluke...But we're quants. You can't just toss out the data that doesn't agree with your existing view."" ***** &gt; The other significant market factor in the week ahead could be any developments on U.S.-China trade negotiations. ***** &gt; But the overriding issue is whether the global economy is slowing, particularly as China's data continues to look weak. ***** &gt; Not all was negative in the U.S. February employment report. Economists said wage growth of 3.4 percent year over year and a lower 3.8 percent unemployment rate were encouraging, as were other data. The report also followed an unusually strong January number of 311,000, after revisions. ***** &gt; The 35-day government shutdown delayed many reports and may have affected the quality of others, economists said. The weakening trend in the first quarter, while expected, is hard to get a handle on, and while it's expected to be temporary, every negative report increases doubts. ***** &gt; ""Anybody who is mentioning the word 'recession' is wrong. The economy invariably slows in Q1. What we don't know is it more than usual, and the poor quality and volatility in the data since the government shutdown has made it impossible to assess,"" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. ***** &gt; First out of the gate Monday will be retail sales, which fell 1.2 percent in December. January's headline number is expected to fall by 0.1 percent but excluding autos and gasoline, sales are expected to rise by 0.7 percent, according to Refinitiv. ***** &gt; Economists say the big drop in retail sales for December makes the comparisons in the first quarter GDP report more difficult. First quarter growth is widely expected to be below 2 percent but the economy is expected to bounce back above 2 percent growth in the second quarter. ***** &gt; ""We are already pretty weak [in the first quarter] because of the retail sales number. The arithmetic that goes into adding up GDP, you're in such a hole to start the quarter because you ended so weak,"" said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets. ***** &gt; Durable goods for January is reported Wednesday, and economists are watching to see what happened to business spending in that report. At the end of the quarter, expenditures slowed down, yet in the fourth quarter GDP report, business spending was surprisingly strong. ***** &gt; CPI on Tuesday is also important. With the Fed now signaling it is pausing in its rate hiking, any surprise pickup in inflation would be significant. ***** &gt; ""Inflation data is important from the Fed's perspective, but I don't think it's going to be something that's going to spook them if we get a stronger report,"" said Cummins. ""We expect 0.3 on headline, core 0.2 percent. Year-over-year core would stay at 2.2 percent for the third month. It doesn't seem like something that's market moving if our forecast is realized."" ***** &gt; The Fed will largely be out of the picture in the coming week, with Fed officials in a quiet period ahead of the next meeting March 19 and 20. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was to appear in an interview on ""60 Minutes"" Sunday. ***** &gt; Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and Dow all down more than 2 percent in their worst week since Dec. 21, right before the Christmas Eve plunge. The market reacted to signs of slowing global growth and concerns the trade talks would not lead to deal. ***** &gt; Keon said the market could be disappointed by a trade deal, unless it is is broad and includes protection for intellectual property and an end of Chinese transfers of U.S. technology. White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Friday that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet later this month but nothing is in ""cement."" ***** &gt; Speaking on CNBC, he pointed to overnight economic data from China that showed exports there plunged 20.7 percent last month from a year ago, missing expectations by a wide margin. ***** &gt; ""We have hurt them,"" Kudlow said on ""Squawk on the Street."" Both sides have indicated they hope to reach a deal. ""We are still negotiating by phone and teleconference."" ***** &gt; Keon said a sweeping deal, with an end to tariffs and a hardline on technology, would drive the market higher. ***** &gt; ""If you get a real deal, you would get a big response. I would not really count on that as a big positive catalyst for stock prices, but it's possible. If the whole thing falls apart, in that case it would be pretty negative for the market, particularly if we increased tariffs,"" said Keon. ***** &gt; Trump has held off another round of tariffs, expected March 1, due to progress in the talks.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/gb8IAy1.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/unuz5GW.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/YHVr95U.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kbGxtjT.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6MSd0js.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2Vz7Y8H.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IFbt3qt.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2s11iDY.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tkMpN2E.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())** NONE.  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/uP4YqLs.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ay7BLjn.png))**  *****  # The Bespoke Report — The KISS Market  &gt; Global equity markets had a rough week, but the US staged a nice intraday rally on Friday after an NFP-driven gap lower.

S&amp;P 500 is up 11.3% and NASDAQ is at 14.2%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all up above average for this point of the year. Pre-election years have historically produced the best average performance out of the four-year cycle.

As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the feat could signal more gains for U.S. stocks: In seven of the last eight 10-week winning streaks, both the Nasdaq and the broader market have climbed over the following 12 months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/10-Week-NASDAQ-winning-streaks-are-historically-bullish.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Technology stocks have rallied 23% since bottoming on December 24, 2018. While equities began the year extremely oversold, solid corporate earnings, a Federal Reserve pause, and progress on trade have helped fuel risk-on sentiment and boost prices.  &gt; “We expect stocks to power through periodic bouts of uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While the road to new market highs could get bumpy, we encourage investors to focus on the fundamentals supporting economic growth and corporate profitability in 2019.”  &gt; The one outlier in Nasdaq’s history of 10-week streaks is the one ending in December 1999, three months before the peak of the “tech bubble.” From the beginning of 1999 to March 2000, the Nasdaq more than doubled to reach record highs, then fell more than 70% through the end of 2002.  &gt; In contrast to that period, we don’t see material signs of excesses in financial markets, and the recent rally has been more broad-based and backed by strong earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average have both climbed 16% over the past 10 weeks, pacing with the Nasdaq’s 20% gain.  *****  # Slow, But Steady  &gt; Slow but steady growth may win the race again as the economic expansion nears the 10-year mark.  &gt; While muted growth in the current economic expansion has been frustrating at times, especially after a swift and painful downturn amid the 2008 financial crisis, it has helped extend the life of this cycle and keep excesses in check.  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has increased an average of 2.3% annually in this cycle, the slowest pace of growth among all expansions since 1970 and a key contributor to this cycle’s near-record age.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Slow-But-Steady-GDP-Growth-Compared-to-Past-Cycles.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Historically, cycles with annual GDP growth higher than 4% lasted about five years on average, while cycles with annual growth lower than 4% lasted about nine years on average.  &gt; “While it’s important to be mindful of where we are in the economic cycle, later-cycle economies can continue to exhibit stable growth for years,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We’re maintaining our positive outlook for 2019, thanks to our conviction in sound fundamentals supporting moderate economic growth.”  &gt; Steady economic growth has been helped in part by a careful and gradual approach to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy efforts have been implemented for several years, but policymakers only started increasing rates in December 2015, more than six years into the expansion. This tightening cycle has persisted for three years now, yet inflation-adjusted interest rates are barely above zero.  &gt; Still, inflation has hovered around the Fed’s 2% target for several months now, and wage growth is healthy, but manageable.

Congressional Democrats are already moving ahead with plans to consider broad changes to federal marijuana laws in 2019.  Whereas the Republican-controlled House for the past several years had blocked votes on most cannabis-related measures, the chamber’s new Democratic majority on Wednesday announced it has scheduled a hearing for next week to examine the difficulties that marijuana businesses face in opening and maintaining bank accounts. Titled, “Challenges and Solutions: Access to Banking Services for Cannabis-Related Businesses,” the hearing will take place on February 13 before a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee. Although a growing number of states are moving to legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use, cannabis remains federally prohibited. As a result, and despite a 2014 guidance memo released on the topic by the Obama administration aimed at clearing up the issue, many financial services providers remain reluctant to work with the industry out of fear of violating money laundering or drug laws. “When we introduced this bill six years ago, we warned that forcing these businesses to deal in cash was threatening public safety. No hearing was given,” Rep. Denny Heck (D-WA) said in an email, referring to marijuana banking legislation he and Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) have filed for the past several Congresses.  He lamented that Republican leadership didn’t schedule a hearing on the proposal even after a security guard at a Colorado dispensary was killed during a robbery. “Chairwoman Waters has made it one of her first priorities to address this urgent and overdue issue, demonstrating that she understands the threat to public safety and the need for Congress to act,” Heck said of the committee’s new leader. “We have a bipartisan proposal to allow well-regulated marijuana businesses to handle their money in a way that is safe and effective for law enforcement to track. I am eager to get to the work of refining it and passing it into law.” That a hearing on the issue was in the works was first noted earlier this week by Politico, and Marijuana Moment reported that the full committee is also actively planning to vote on a marijuana banking bill in the coming months. The newly scheduled marijuana hearing is a signal that Democrats intend to move cannabis legislation this year, and is likely to be the first in a series of committee-level actions across the House on the issue. “The upcoming hearing presents a real opportunity for the Democratic Party to assert their leadership by finally beginning the conversation on how we end the failed policy of marijuana criminalization,” Justin Strekal, political director for NORML, said.  While two limited medical cannabis research bills were able to advance out of House committees last year, they never made it to the floor for votes. Meanwhile, Republican leaders consistently prevented members from offering marijuana-related amendments—including ones on banking issues—to larger legislation. In contrast, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) suggested in a memo to party leaders late last year that they pursue a step-by-step approach to legalize marijuana in 2019. His plan recommends that Financial Services and other committees first begin holding hearings on incremental reforms like banking access, research expansion and medical cannabis for military veterans before passing bills on those issues as part of a lead up to ultimately approving broader legislation to formally end federal marijuana prohibition by the end of the year. A House bill to protect banks from being punished for working with state-legal marijuana businesses that Heck and Perlmutter introduced garnered 95 cosponsors in the last Congress, and 20 senators signed onto a companion bill, but neither were given hearings or brought up for votes. “Depriving state-legal cannabis businesses of basic banking services and forcing them to operate entirely in cash presents a significant safety risk, not just to those businesses and their employees, but to the public,” Don Murphy, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in an email. “Support for addressing the cannabis banking problem is strong and bipartisan, and it appears Congress may be ready to adopt a real, commonsense solution. Members concerned about public safety should be jumping at the chance to express their support for this legislation.”  “This hearing is historic for cannabis policy reform advocates, business owners and the banking sector, and could directly lead to the first in what is hopefully a series of positive changes in the 2019 legislative cycle,”   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, for example, suggested in testimony before a House committee early last year that he supports letting marijuana businesses store their profits in banks. “I assure you that we don’t want bags of cash,” he said. “We do want to find a solution to make sure that businesses that have large access to cash have a way to get them into a depository institution for it to be safe.”  In a separate hearing Mnuchin revealed that addressing the issue is at the “top of the list” of his concerns. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the growing gap between state and federal marijuana laws “puts federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation… It would great if that could be clarified.” And last month, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting called on Congress to “act at the national level to legalize marijuana if they want those entities involved in that business to utilize the U.S. banking system.”  Meanwhile, although many major financial institutions are staying away from the cannabis industry, federal data does show that an inceasing number of banks are beginning to work with marijuana growers, sellers, processors and related businesses.   So in short - Don't sell out of fear just yet.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2019/02/06/the-first-marijuana-hearing-of-the-new-congress-has-been-scheduled/amp/|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|494173.0|public|confidence|self|The First Marijuana Hearing Of The New Congress Has Been Scheduled - 2019 positive outlook.||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ao3jle/the_first_marijuana_hearing_of_the_new_congress/|house_only|1.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'oVyE-i_f8EEKdSBSQopkaZ3v_IDWmDAru9wD_AZPM8k', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YoatM_ZB3pH-f_3aw7v83-d7T4lAjwbb7vX1IpLTiLY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af81d60e42b831ccb3a2d551f2080483d6c120c', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YoatM_ZB3pH-f_3aw7v83-d7T4lAjwbb7vX1IpLTiLY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f87f2ff2b1989211d437a9fc45b7769534b91162', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YoatM_ZB3pH-f_3aw7v83-d7T4lAjwbb7vX1IpLTiLY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8810e1b5eb83a0d359dffb106b8e2ca5f6795346', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 315, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YoatM_ZB3pH-f_3aw7v83-d7T4lAjwbb7vX1IpLTiLY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=579b2ecae1916cf42b4d749211f85c643ffbcfca', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||||||||||2019-02-07|EXPR

Thanks in part to the popularity of A-List, the overall AMC Stubs program has surpassed 17 million member households, up from about 2.5 million member households only 2 1/2 years ago.  With the surging popularity of A-List which is also propelling more and more people to book their tickets online, AMC is taking further steps to make the movie-going experience more convenient than ever before.  Beginning immediately, households can use a common credit card as the payment method for separate, individual A-List accounts. Also effective immediately, AMC has extended the minimum age for AMC Stubs A-List from 18 years old currently to 16 years old with a valid photo ID. AMC plans to roll out reserved seating in all AMC-branded theatres and AMC DINE-IN theatres by June of 2019. This increase in reserved seating locations will not apply to AMC CLASSIC branded theatres. Also by the end of June 2019, all guests going to all the AMC-branded theatres in the metropolitan areas of Boston, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco will have access to AMC “Mobile Ordering,” which lets guests purchase their food and drinks online at the same time as they reserve their tickets, easily and conveniently picking them up when they arrive at the theatre. Mobile Ordering already exists and is functioning well at 52 locations in 24 markets around the country. In addition to these added benefits for AMC guests around the country, AMC is holding the line on A-List pricing for 2019, still unchanged at $19.95 plus tax per month in 35 states. AMC is making modest pricing adjustments in states where the program is most popular. Beginning January 9, 2019, the monthly price of AMC Stubs A-List will move to $21.95 plus tax for guests in Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington state and The District of Columbia. The program moves to $23.95 plus tax for guests in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.  Even so, all current A-List members as well as any new members who sign up before January 9, 2019, will continue to enjoy their 12-month $19.95 price guarantee from the start of their membership. So, to pick two illustrative examples, A-List members in Los Angeles who signed up in September of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their September 2019 billing cycle, or those in New York who will sign up as new A-List members in December of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their December 2019 billing cycle.  AMC will continue to operate its A-List program with transparency and clarity. So that A-List members can always know what they can expect with reliability and predictability, AMC hereby warrants that for all guests who join on or after January 9, 2019, the Company will provide at least 90-days advance notice before making any changes to their A-List program’s pricing or benefits. Additionally, reflecting commitments already made, for those A-List members who have joined or will join before January 9, 2019, they are assured not only of 90-days advance notice of any future change in pricing or benefits, but also that no such change would apply to them until 12 months after their initial enrollment date. As a reputable operator, AMC has no desire to whipsaw its guests with frequent change, nor would it do so without providing guests reasonable advance notice.  All other aspects of the AMC Stubs A-List program remain unchanged, including:  Up to three movies per week, in every available AMC showtime and format, including IMAX at AMC, Dolby Cinema at AMC, RealD 3D and Prime at AMC AMC Stubs A-List can be used at the spur of the moment or also can make planning ahead days or weeks in advance possible, as securing tickets is made easy via reservations capabilities on the AMCTheatres.com web site, or on the AMC Theatres mobile app. AMC Stubs A-List members also enjoy all the discounts and benefits of AMC Stubs Premiere, including free upgrades on popcorn and soda, free refills on large popcorn, express service at the box office and concession stand, no online ticketing fees and 100 points for every $1 spent for the AMC Stubs A-List monthly fee, tickets purchased for friends and family, and food &amp; beverage spending at AMC. AMC Stubs Premiere and A-List members receive a $5 reward for every 5,000 points earned, which translates to a 10% credit toward future AMC purchases. Adam Aron, AMC CEO and President, said, “In our minds, increasing enrollments to 17 million AMC Stubs member households over the past 2 1/2 years, or achieving initial enrollments of a half million members in AMC Stubs A-List in just 4 1/2 months, are astounding numbers. We have immensely successful programs here, and there should be no doubt, AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List are here to stay with these programs’ structures and valuable benefits remaining fully intact. Our objective for these programs is that they continue to be both popular and profitable. Our decision to keep the AMC Stubs A-List monthly price unchanged in 35 states, along with only a modest price adjustment in some key markets going in place in early 2019, will keep us in that sweet spot of successfully balancing profits and popularity. We encourage current A-List members to tell their friends and families that our 12-month price and benefit guarantee remains fully in place for A-List members who have already joined or who do so prior to January 9, 2019. So, the program pricing of $19.95 will remain at that level for everyone and will be unchanged anywhere for a full 12 months after initial enrollment if moviegoers act now to become A-Listers.”  For information about AMC Stubs A-List and to sign up, guests can inquire at their local AMC Theatre, or at AMC’s web site amctheatres.com/alist or on AMC’s iOS and Android mobile apps after downloading or updating them with the latest app release.

Italy was reportedly said to provide a response to the EU letter on Monday as the EU has requested; on the matter Commissioner Moscovici stressed it will be important how Italy responds; he is willing to reduce tensions with the country and maintain a constructive dialog despite disagreements and reassured that it was clear from everyone he spoke to during the Italy visit that Italy wants to remain within the heart of Europe. He also clarified the EU will not interfere with the economic policies and reported no decision has been made on Italy's budget. Moreover a dispute within the coalition government is adding pressure on the country political situation in the country after the budget plan was highly criticised by the EU Commission. On Thursday Deputy PM Di-Maio urged a solution with the League on a tax amnesty, a common policy in Italy where parties can avoid taxes by paying a fee favoured by the League. Italy's Deputy PM Salvini said he will return to Rome on Saturday to solve the dispute, adding that coalition tensions must stop. Also, in a live Facebook video, he announced to be ready to remove the parts of the tax plan that the Five-Star objects; he reiterated he is willing to govern with the party for a full five-year term and noted that the EU warning letter shows that Italy is in the right.    * BREXIT: UK is said to drop Brexit demand on a time-limited backstop to try and reach a Brexit deal, sources reported; a move which could leave the UK in the EU customs regime indefinitely, it is being seen as a potential gamble to move Brexit talks along, though will infuriate Brexiteers. EU Chief Negotiator Barnier said the Brexit accord is possible but difficult and warned that problems regarding Ireland could result in a failure of Brexit talks; he reiterated that they are 90% there in reaching an agreement with UK and added that he is still not certain a deal will be reached. UK PM May spokeswoman noted we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves on the idea of extending the transition period adding that PM May will brief around 120 business leaders on the latest developments in Brexit later today. In later news flow, sources reported that UK PM May told business leaders that EU leaders are committed to a Brexit deal this autumn.    * TRADE: The US requested the WTO adjudication in disputes regarding China's IP policies as well as against Canada, China, EU and Mexico over retaliatory tariffs. Additionally, China Vice Premier Liu He said China and the US are ""in touch"". Note, Chinese President Xi and US President Trump have tentatively agreed to talks at the G20 Summit on November 29th. Alongside this, US exporters have cancelled the sale of 180K tons of soybeans to China.    * GEOPOLITCS: The Washington Post US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin still plans to attend Saudi anti-terror financing meeting in wake of journalist Khashoggi’s disappearance. Note however that this is a separate summit from the financial summit Mnuchin said he would not attend earlier in the week.    * FED: Fed's Bostic (Voter, Dovish) said there is no sign of dark clouds on the horizon that could trip an economy is 'chugging along'; he reiterated trade policy remains a risk to outlook. Fed’s Kaplan (non-voter) sees neutral at between 3.00-3.50%, and said two or three more rate hikes would take the Fed to neutral; says he is not committed on the need to raise above neutral levels, it will depend on productivity. Elsewhere, Kaplan said current market gyrations are not a concerns, says corrections can be 'healthy' in addressing imbalances.    * BOE: BoE's Carney said the BoE is focusing on the possible consequences of a cliff-edge Brexit, and ahead of a Brexit outcome, the Central Bank is preparing for the worst case scenarios rather than hoping for the best.    * EXISTING HOME SALES fell by 3.4%, more than the expected 0.7% posting at 5.15mln (Exp.  5.3mln), the lowest level since November 2015 and marking the 6th consecutive monthly drop. Analysts at Pantheon point out ‘higher mortgage rates, slightly tighter lending standards and the limiting of state/local tax deductions’, included in December’s tax reforms, are hurting the headline; they believe October’s reading will not be any better. They however do not  see a sustained decline in sales and expect a temporary rebound will occur by the end of the year.    * CANADIAN CPI &amp; RETAIL SALES: CPI softened in September posting at -0.4% below the previous -0.1% sending the yy headline lower to 2.2% from 2.8%, significantly below the 2.7% consensus. The Core measure also weakened falling to 1.5% from 1.7%. Retail sales (August) also missed expectations and were down 0.4% expectations were for a 0.2% increase. Scotiabank argues that although growth edged a little higher, data ‘continues to reverse the Canadian out-performance seen in the summer’ noting that these are not the sort of prints that would push the BoC away from gradual policy. Analysts at the bank further note that although a 25bps hike at the meeting next week is almost certain, this reduces the likelihood of a ‘hawkish hike’.    * SPX -0.04% at 2768, NDX -0.12% at 7107, DJI +0.25% at 25442. SECTORS: Energy -0.8%, Materials -0.7%, Industrials -0.4%, Cons Discretionary -0.9%, Cons Staples +2.3%, Healthcare -0.95%, Financials +0.3%, Tech +0.01%, Telecoms +0.17%, Utilities +1.6%.    * STOCKS SPECIFICS: PayPal (PYPL), American Express (AXP) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) gained following earnings reports, where they all beat on EPS estimates. Apple (AAPL) also a top mover following a reiteration at Wedbush, while Disney (DIS) traded higher after an upgrade at Barclays. Disappointments in earnings included VF Corp (VFC), after missing its EPS estimates, and State Street (STT) which reported less than expected Q3 revenue. Broker moves caused eBay (EBAY) and Valero (VLO) to nosedive on the day following downgrades at Stifel and Goldman respectively. DowDuPont (DWDP) was also a bottom mover on the back of it announcing a USD 4.6bln goodwill impairment charge.    * WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.47 HIGHER AT USD 69.12/BBL; BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.49 HIGHER AT USD 79.79/BBL. Oil ends Friday higher on the day, but posts the second consecutive red week, with inventory builds and trade tensions being used to explain the losses. On Friday, data showed oil drillers adding rigs for the second week, taking the oil rig count to the highest since March 2015, Baker Hughes said. Elsewhere, Chinese refinery throughput hit a record high in September, with analysts suggesting that higher China demand is providing another supporting factor to crude markets. On the OPEC+ front, data on Friday showed compliance with the supply-cut deal is running at a 111% clip in September, falling form 129% in August. Equity price strength also provided bullish support on Friday. Some desks are focussing on the front-month contango in WTI, with the widening gap being attributed to anticipation of further inventory builds at Cushing as new pipelines come online.    * US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 6 TICKS LOWER AT 117-30+. Yields were higher by 2-4bps across the curve by settlement, with the Treasury complex taking cues from the situation in Italy, which injected choppy trade into Bunds and BTPs. However, as EU Commissioner Moscovici struck a positive, constructive tone, flows moved back into risk, allowing the T-Note to move lower and settle into a range. Despite the higher yields, major curve spreads flattened by 0.5-1.5bps.    #WEEKLY FX WRAP   DXY: The broad Dollar and index look set to end the week near best levels, and supported by a combination of elevated US Treasury yields in wake of upbeat hawkish FOMC minutes, ongoing US-global trade issues and diplomatic sanctions and relative weakness in counterpart currencies for similar reasons plus more specific factors. The DXY is keeping tabs on 96.000 within 96.098-94.789 trading parameters and a starting price of 95.349.    * NZD, AUD: The Kiwi is soaring into the weekend and just hit fresh wtd peaks vs its US and Aud peers just above  0.6600 and close to 1.0800 respectively. However, the Nzd’s ascent from earlier lows circa 0.6500, or a little under, and 1.0950, is largely indirect rather than due to independent NZ positive impulses/factors as hedging ahead of Sydney’s by-election prompted sharp cross-winds and risk-related positioning.    * EUR/GBP: Both ending Friday’s EU session on the rebound, as the single currency benefits from the general Greenback retracement and a recovery in overall risk sentiment partly on seemingly less EU angst over Italy’s budget, although the official response is due next Monday when Rome has been asked (requested) to reply to a letter detailing reservations about the 2019 fiscal plan in particular. Eur/Usd also derived a degree of technical support and recovery momentum amidst buying interest ahead of a key Fib, but failed to reach 1.3 bn option expiries at the 1.1500 strike by a whisker and remains well off the highs around 1.1620. A similar story for the Pound although UK data also impacted as benign CPI and a hefty retail sales miss overshadowed better than expected average earnings. However, Brexit grabbed the bulk of the headlines yet again after weekend talks ahead of this week’s EU summit broke down on the Irish border and customs union issues that remain unresolved, with talks turning towards a transition extension and PM looking increasingly isolated/under threat. Nevertheless, Cable escaped further losses from 1.3235 at one stage through 1.3000, albeit only just as EU’s Barnier allayed some fears that the bloc are set on imposing hard withdrawal terms.    * CAD: The Loonie tracked volatility in oil prices to an extent within a 1.2910-1.3120 range before hitting multi-week lows vs its US counterpart and clearing supposedly decent bids at 1.3100 on the back of significantly weaker than forecast Canadian data in the shape of CPI and retail sales. However, expectations are still sky-high for a 25 bp BoC hike next week given other more upbeat macro indicators and a major uncertainty removed (though not all by any means) following the USMCA deal in principle to replace NAFTA.    * JPY: A net loser vs the Usd, like the CHF, but more strictly along risk-off/on lines, as Usd/Jpy only just pulled up short of a key tech resistance point around 112.75 vs 111.61 at the other extreme and also close to a chart support and not far from the middle of that band at the beginning of the week. Aside from an unwind of safe-haven premium/demand, the Jpy was undermined by sub-consensus Japanese data (trade, and exports especially, plus inflation) and dovish commentary from BoJ Governor Kuroda.    * SEK, NOK: In stark contrast, hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank policy vibes continued to propel the Scandi crowns, with technical momentum also building in the Eur crosses sub-10.3000 and below 9.4500, ahead of next week’s meetings that are not seen coming with any actual key rate moves, but underlining tightening guidance "|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|350983.0|public|confidence|self|Late Night Snack||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9pql21/late_night_snack/|house_only|1.0|||||||28d11680-b4b7-11e8-8326-0e59e57bcd3e||||||||||||||||2018-10-20|EXPR

October 12, 2018 Investor focus turns to rates, trade, valuations, and growth.  # Key Points  * Concerns about rising interest rates, trade, elevated valuations, and slowing growth have driven major global stock indexes downward. * Expectations have grown that the U.S. Fed will continue raising short-term rates, while ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China are causing considerable unrest. * Despite the downturn and the pickup in volatility, the backdrop for world equity markets remains generally favorable.  It is not yet clear how long or deep the sell‑off will prove to be—indeed, markets are currently staging something of a recovery. Yet, investors are wondering what’s driving the volatility and if it portends a more challenging period ahead.  “Some of the tailwinds that have thrust U.S. equity markets to record highs in 2018 could become headwinds over the next year or so,” recently commented Jeff Rottinghaus, a U.S. large‑cap portfolio manager. “While the environment should remain supportive for investing, it could become more challenging.”  Despite the downturn and the pickup in volatility, the backdrop for world equity markets remains generally favorable. U.S. economic and corporate profit growth have been very strong in 2018, but some valuations are elevated, and slower growth is likely as interest rates rise and the impact of recent tax cuts fades.  Interest rates and inflation are still very low in Japan and many developed European countries, where equity valuations are attractive and corporate earnings growth is likely to continue. Although emerging markets have significantly under-performed this year, their fundamental valuations are attractive relative to the U.S. and most developed markets.  #### RATE HIKES, INFLATION CONCERNS  A key driver of the recent declines is that expectations have been growing that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue raising short‑term interest rates, which has led to a spike in bond yields. The fact that the Fed is also in the process of reducing its balance sheet as it winds down its quantitative easing program is also pushing yields higher, as is the U.S. government’s ongoing large‑scale issuance of Treasury securities to finance its budget deficit.  Expectations of continued Fed rate hikes have been growing because of the strong performance of the U.S. economy, jobs growth, and accelerating wages, which are fueling concerns about inflation, even as current inflation signals remain tame. Higher import prices due to U.S. tariffs could also put upward pressure on prices.  Rising inflation increases the likelihood that the Fed will increase short‑term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. Higher short‑term rates translate into higher borrowing costs, which can dissuade consumers and businesses from making purchases and investments, weighing on companies’ profit margins and potentially slowing the economy.  At present, the Fed is projecting that it will raise rates once more in 2018 and three times in 2019. T. Rowe Price Chief U.S. Economist Alan Levenson currently believes that the Fed will be a bit more aggressive, raising rates again in December and once per quarter through next year.  “I think market psychology is important now—the expectation over the last decade has been that the Fed will come to help, but the risk is that it cannot and will not help stabilize the markets anytime soon,” says Quentin Fitzsimmons, portfolio manager and member of the fixed income global investment team. “In this sense, the markets will be very sensitive to short‑term data developments.”  #### TRADE TENSIONS NOT ABATING  The ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China over trade are causing considerable unrest in markets. The two countries have been implementing—and threatening to broaden—tariffs on a wide variety of imports from each other, and there is no indication that tensions will soon ease.  Over decades, large U.S. companies, particularly manufacturers, have developed extensive global supply chains, relying on worldwide sources of lower‑cost production. Higher component costs due to tariffs could bring higher inflation over the long term, says Peter Bates, manager of a global industrials strategy. “But companies would eventually learn how to maximize their returns under the new rules.”  Larry Puglia, U.S. large‑cap core growth portfolio manager, is encouraged by the agreements in progress with the European Union and Mexico and Canada. “Pursuing fairer trade terms is desirable but entails certain risks,” he says. “It would be premature to make investment decisions that assume successful resolution of these issues. We’re doing the math to determine what’s at stake.”  #### INFLATED VALUATIONS MAKE COMPANIES VULNERABLE  U.S. stocks, particularly large‑cap and growth stocks, have been trading at elevated levels. Given that equity markets have been rising for almost 10 years (after bottoming in March 2009) and that economic and corporate earnings growth have also been strong for a long period, these high valuations may reflect a view that current favorable fundamentals will remain for the foreseeable future. If this is the case, markets could be vulnerable to any developments that imply a weaker economic outlook.  Recent declines in the so‑called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), which have led the U.S. stock market for some time, may have contributed to the wider sell off. Other high performers, such as car‑maker Tesla and Chinese companies Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, have also seen their shares retreat from their best levels. While many of these stocks seem to have favorable fundamentals, it would not be unusual for them to experience a period of weaker performance.  “The market’s pullback is being generally driven by the technology sector and Internet companies,” explains Don Peters, Diversified Mid‑Cap Growth and Tax‑Efficient Equity portfolio manager. “Frankly, I’m surprised that it has taken so long for the highest‑growth, highest‑momentum names that have led the market for quite some time to experience a correction.”  European equity valuations are modestly attractive compared with the U.S., while UK equities are trading at a discount to most global equity markets, probably due to ongoing uncertainty over Brexit. In Asian and Pacific developed markets, valuations are generally attractive compared with the U.S., but earnings remain vulnerable to any slowdown in global trade. Japanese equities, in particular, are supported by strong relative valuations, positive earnings growth, and gradually improving corporate governance.  Equity valuations in emerging markets are more attractive than those of developed markets as equities have sold off on the back of trade concerns and currency weakness and have significantly underperformed as a result. In the six‑month period ended September 30, 2018, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trailed the S&amp;P 500 Index by about 20 percentage points in dollar terms (‑8.73% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index versus 11.41% for the S&amp;P 500 Index).  #### GLOBAL GROWTH FIRM—FOR NOW  Recent U.S. economic growth has been strong. Fiscal spending, tax reform, and deregulation are driving the current period of accelerating growth, but late‑cycle stimulus, such as from last year’s tax cuts, may result in the economy “overheating,” or growing at an unsustainably fast pace.  “The U.S. economy, buoyed by tax reform and deregulation policies, is strong,” says Rottinghaus. “Manufacturing has reached new highs, leading indicators are positive, consumer confidence is favorable, and small business optimism is at an all‑time high. However, we are in the later stages of this economic cycle with less accommodative monetary policies, higher interest rates, and inflation and labor costs rising amid tighter labor markets.”  Growth in developed Europe is slowing but remains relatively stable. However, sentiment indicators are at their lowest levels in about nine months. In the UK, economic growth appears healthy, with low unemployment, reasonable wage growth, and limited degrees of slack.  Trade‑driven economies in theAsia‑Pacific region are healthy but slowing as global growth continues to moderate. Japanese economic activity has surprised to the upside but may face a soft patch due to recent natural disasters. Australia’s economic activity continues to soften, with the housing market a particular concern.  In emerging markets, economic momentum in China is fading, but policymakers will likely continue to respond with accommodative measures. Growth is expected to slow in other emerging countries, where interest rates are trending upward and central banks are tightening monetary policies. Countries that are major importers of oil, such as Turkey and India, are also being hurt by higher oil prices—the price of a barrel of global benchmark Brent crude recently above USD $80, a four‑year high.  #### WHAT HAPPENS NOW?  Although downturns are always disconcerting, occasional periods of turbulence are to be expected. It should be noted that despite the sell‑off and the pickup in volatility, the backdrop for world equity markets remains generally favorable.  It is impossible to predict with certainty whether the sell‑off will prove to be a temporary dip or something more serious. What’s more, timing the market is notoriously difficult, even for investment professionals. A failed attempt to time the market can hurt long‑term investment performance in two different ways: first, by selling assets when they have lost some value and going to cash, effectively locking in those losses; and second, by missing out on at least some of the gains when the market bottoms and starts to rebound.  “While the economic and capital market environment is more favorable than it’s been for some time, investors should not reasonably expect the market’s robust returns to continue indefinitely,” Peters says. “Given the strong performance we’ve had in the last few years, it would not be surprising to see lower stock market returns in the years ahead. That said, equities are still the best choice for investors seeking long‑term capital growth.”  **Important Information**  This material is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice or a recommendation to take any particular investment action.

Their focus lies on the oncology sector, having engineered technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T Cells to fight cancer.  Their belief is that their two main drug candidates will address what other therapies are currently lacking while having the potential to treat a broad patient population through either individual therapies or in conjunction with other mechanisms of action.  Although their main focus is the immuno-oncology, they believe that their candidates also have potential to serve in therapeutic realms such as infectious and allergic diseases as they have a few different collaboration and partnerships underway leveraging their GLAAS platforms.    Immune Design’s management team, board of directors, and scientific advisory board boast a diverse group of individuals who don’t lack experience in the industry.  The CEO, Carlos Paya, has served as Vice President at Eli Lilly, President of Elan Corporation, and was also a professor of Medicine, Immunology, and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The company also has an extensive list of Doctors and PhD researchers backing the company’s advisory board and management team.     #**Pipeline:**  The company currently has 6 different products in their pipeline ranging from Preclinical to Phase II.  Still in the early stages of development, the company is actively seeking growth and partnerships to solidify their financial and developmental future.  Each of their GLAAS products, 3 of them, have partnerships lined up for the development and licensing of the candidates.  These partnerships include Sanofi, MedImmune, and Sanofi Pasteur.   To match their product collaborations, they are also working in conjunction with Merck and Genetech in clinical collaborations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of their immuno-oncology products.  Their immuno-oncology pipeline also has 3 candidates targeting different forms of cancer.  Their entire pipeline is as follows:     #**Specific Drug:**  While the company has several different products filling their pipeline, we are concerned with CMB305.  Immune Design has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Genetech, a member of Roche, to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMB305 cancer immunotherapy when combined with the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.    CMB305 is a prime-boost product designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, specifically soft tissue sarcoma.  NY-ES0-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid state tumors in varying degrees.  CMB305 is comprised of two parts, a “prime” and a “boost”, which are designed to work synergistically to induce anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the NY-ES0-1-expressing tumors.  It is also hypothesized that CMB305 will also generate memory CTLs, providing for long-term immune response systems while enhancing other immune anti-tumor mechanisms along the way.    Currently, CMB305 is in different stages of clinical development, which include monotherapy Phase I as well as a fully-enrolled Phase II trial comprised of individuals with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma).  This combination study is utilizing either CMB305 with Genetech’s cancer immunotherapy TECENTRIQ, or atezolizumab alone.   Last year, the company reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 as a monotherapy.  In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate of 64% was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in &gt;50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, the presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks.   Immune Design has received Orphan Drug Designation in soft tissue sarcoma for both components of CMB305 in the EU and US, and depending upon further trial results soft tissue sarcoma will be the first indication in which CMB305 will be filed for regulatory approval.  There is a significant unmet need in this market, and the company holds the stance that the potential benefit of CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates.    #**Current and Forecasted Market:**  Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events.  Soft tissue sarcoma is rapidly growing, expected to reach a global CAGR of over 8% over the next 6 years.  With over 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma, it is a rare and diverse group of cancers that can develop from nearly any tissue.  There are approximately 13,000 individuals who suffer from soft tissue sarcoma each year, and with a high incidence rate and increased awareness about the condition, the market is expected to continue to expand.   The current soft tissue sarcoma market size is valued around $700 million as of 2017, and with an expected CAGR of more than 8%, In 2017, 12,715 new diagnosis and 5,070 deaths due to STS were reported in the U.S. Bone sarcomas accounted for 3,373 new cases and 1,649 deaths in 2017. The lifetime risk of developing a sarcoma is 0.4%. Approximately 45.0% of bone sarcomas and 21.0% of STS are diagnosed in people in the age group of 0-35 years.  Currently, chemotherapy and targeted therapy are the only approved treatments for sarcoma.  Several immuno-oncology agents are also under investigation, with Immune Design leading the forefront to fill this unmet market need.    #**Competition:**  The largest market competition are companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Celgene and others.  However, not all of these companies are focusing on developments in immuno-oncology and developing long term body resistance to tumors.   There is a large market for immuno-oncology that is unmet and waiting to be filled.  Novartis holds roughly 30% of the market share for sarcoma treatment, which Immune Design seeks to start to take if the product becomes approved.     Financials:  MDZ reported loss of 29 cents per share in second-quarter 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents and the year-ago loss of 54 cents.  Immune Design’s shares have lost 8.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2%.  However their revenues are up this quarter YOY to $0.76 million mainly due to the collaboration with Sanofi for G103 and product sales to collaboration partners.  R&amp;D expenses are increasing as they are moving along their extensive pipeline through the clinical phases.     Biggest note on their finances, Immune Design expects cash on hand to be enough to fund operations through the second half of 2020.  Due to their strategic partnerships and financing, the company is able to limit diluting investors or taking on greater debt.  The company has enough cash and cash equivalents, $73 million, to finance all operations for more than a year, which is a very rare occurrence in these small cap biotech companies.    #**Review:**  My sort of concerns, the low rate of success that oncology drug candidates have with the FDA.  Cancer is a tough market.  Data shows that cancer drugs have the lowest success rate of making it from Phase I to FDA approval, a mere 3.4%.  Although, cancer trials that used biomarkers had higher success rates, though, and the overall oncology drug approval rate for 2015 was 8.3%, which was due to the booming immuno-oncology field.  So, although oncology drugs lag, immuno-oncology pulls does not.  The past few years, especially under the Trump administration, drug approval rates have been higher than ever in recent history.    For this product, Phase II studies patients and provides researchers with additional safety data to refine research questions and develop further methodologies to study the candidate and efficacy.  They utilize this data to formulate Phase III protocols.  Will not really reveal any benefits of the drug or therapeutic effects, rather simply show the safety of the product with some minor data.  As stated earlier, the company believes that CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates.  Along with Orphan Designation and the need to get effective drugs approved in the Oncology market, I believe the FDA will try to push a product such as this through. I have no fear of dilution due to the cash on hand to hold them for another two years.   Looking at their chart, the stock price has held a $3.30 support zone for the past year, consistently bouncing off of these low levels producing 10% plus gains and even going as far up as $5.00 just a few months ago.  The volatility of this stock is fairly high, and I would personally use this to my advantage.  They diluted with a $80 million offering in October 2017 causing a massive drop in share price.  I doubt the company will seek to ruin their shareholder base further any time soon.  I feel a purchase at under $3.40 is a great move and holding for $4.00 minimum.     #**TLDR**:  Shit looks like a solid buy at this cheap support level.  They are showing safety in their studies or hinting at it, Phase II is all about safety, and with the Orphan Drug designation they have potential to meet a dire need.  Plenty of cash on hand, already screwed their investors with a dilution a year ago, dont have to worry about a dilution for another year or so as they have cash on hand to operate for two years.  I can see a 20-30% increase in the next month or two going from $3.30 to $4.00 as my minimum price target.  |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|325544.0|public|confidence|self|$IMDZ - Immune Design, done for now Im drunk||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9fzjnc/imdz_immune_design_done_for_now_im_drunk/|house_only|1.0||||||||0.0|||||||||||||||2018-09-15|EXPR

Saudi’s Public Investment Fund built the undisclosed stake of between 3 and 5 per cent of the electric vehicle maker’s shares this year, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.   At Tesla’s current share price, the position is worth between $1.7bn and $2.9bn. The stake, which is below the 5 per cent threshold that requires public disclosure, makes the PIF one of Tesla’s eight biggest shareholders, according to Bloomberg data.   The PIF, which has more than $250bn in assets, initially approached Tesla and chief executive Elon Musk to express interest in purchasing newly issued shares in the company.   However, Tesla did not act on the interest, one person informed on the matter said. Instead, the Saudi state fund acquired the position in secondary markets with the help of JPMorgan. Mr Musk and Tesla are aware of the PIF shareholding, this person said.   The exact timing of the purchase is not known, though it is believed to have taken place after the crown prince’s tour of the US in March.   Another person said the PIF and Mr Musk had been in touch since the Saudi fund bought a $3.5bn stake in ride-hailing group Uber in June 2016.   £2.2bn   Tesla’s cash reserves at the end of June   Mr Musk has resisted selling new shares this year, even though rating agency Moody’s and many Wall Street analysts have argued he should build a bigger financial cushion.   Tesla burnt through $1.8bn in the first half of the year, leaving it with cash reserves of $2.2bn at the end of June. Mr Musk maintains that the electric carmaker will be cashflow positive in the final two quarters of this year.   Saudi Arabia’s investment appeared to confirm Mr Musk’s claim last week that “we certainly could raise money”. However, the Tesla boss also said it would be “better discipline” not to sell more shares. He is trying to prove to Wall Street that Tesla finally, after 15 years, has a financially sustainable business.   Chinese internet company Tencent took a 5 per cent stake in Tesla through stock market purchases early last year, paying out about $1.7bn to amass the position.   Tesla’s stock is a battleground for short-sellers and those who believe in Mr Musk’s vision for the company. According to Markit data, 27 per cent of the company’s free float is out on loan to investors betting that its share price will decline, making it one of the most heavily shorted companies on the US market.     The PIF is driving the economic diversification efforts of Prince Mohammed, who is looking to wean his country’s economy off a reliance on income generated from oil. Its operations are managed by the crown prince’s trusted lieutenant Yasir al-Rumayyan.   In addition to the bet on Uber, the PIF has made several big-ticket investments, including a $45bn investment in the SoftBank Vision Fund and an up-to-$20bn commitment in an infrastructure fund managed by Blackstone. It also made a $400m investment in March in Florida-based Magic Leap, which makes “mixed reality” headsets.   Recommended   Analysis Automobiles Tesla seeks to convince it has turned the corner The fund continues to look for other investment opportunities in companies linked to alternative energy. During his visit to the US Prince Mohammed and SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son unveiled an initiative to create the world’s largest solar power generation project in the kingdom, aiming to spend $200bn by 2030.   More recently, the PIF has been in talks with global banks to borrow between $6bn and $8bn, marking the first time that the vehicle entrusted with driving the kingdom’s economic transformation will directly tap banks to fund its mission.   Tesla and JPMorgan declined to comment. The PIF could not be reached for comment.  |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|300616.0|public|confidence|self|Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund builds $2bn Tesla stake||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95d48l/saudi_arabias_sovereign_wealth_fund_builds_2bn/|house_only|1.0||||||||0.0||||||markdown|||||||||2018-08-07|EXPR

American Express Plans to Increase Quarterly Dividend by 11 Percent and        Buy Back up to $3.4 Billion of Common Shares Through Q2        2019 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS        WIRE)--June 28, 2018--       American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) said today that the Board of        Governors of the Federal Reserve System did not object to its adjusted        capital plan submitted as part of the 2018 Comprehensive Capital        Analysis and Review (CCAR). The plan included:         \-- Increasing the Company's quarterly dividend to 39 cents per share       beginning with the third quarter 2018 dividend declaration, subject to       approval by the Company's board of directors;     -- Repurchasing up to $3.4 billion of common shares during the CCAR approval       period of Q3'18 to Q2'19. This new authorization enables the Company to       repurchase up to $1.6 billion of common shares in calendar year 2018, and       up to an additional $1.9 billion in the first half of 2019.   The plan supports the Company's objectives to restore capital to target        levels while supporting asset growth and distributing capital to        shareholders. As previously announced, the Company plans to resume share        repurchases in the second half of the year.       The timing and amount of common shares purchased under the Company's        authorized capital plans will depend on various factors, including the        Company's business plans, financial performance and market conditions.        Repurchase of common shares will be pursuant to the share repurchase        program previously authorized by the Company's board of directors on September        26, 2017.       As required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer        Protection Act, the Company has also published on June 21, 2018        a summary of the results of the Company-run stress tests performed under        the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. These disclosures do        not reflect the capital plan described above, but reflect certain        assumptions and capital actions as required under the Federal Reserve's        rules.

Why? Because his decision will show how regulators view “vertical mergers”—aka combining firms that operate in different parts of the same supply chain.

It’s come to my attention recently that some of you don’t know jack shit about options. If I wasn’t already terminally autistic, some of the comments I’ve read in the sub might have made me go full retard.  With that said, my friend Jack Daniels and I have taken it upon ourselves to get you motherfuckers #LEARNT on some god damn options. While I have little faith that most of you will truly understand the intimate innerworkings and dynamics of derivatives, I have no doubt that a large majority of you will take one or two small pieces of information away from this. The goal here is to get you to the point where you can start overestimating your abilities again, like a good boy should, instead of blind dick swinging, like most of you are currently doing.  *Disclaimer: I’m going to skip all the boring, possibly foundationally necessary academics behind where the Greeks come from (inb4 Greece), Black, Scholes, and Merton’s research, Ito’s Lemma, and all that jazz. If you want to look it up on your own time, read a fucking book. Hull’s book on derivatives is basically like the bible for this shit.*  *Credibility: I’m a financial analyst in the risk department of a large insurance company, and work with our hedging portfolio on a daily basis. I also have a Bloomberg terminal that I like to aggressively use so that everyone thinks I know what I’m doing.*   ---   #Background There are only 4 Greeks that you really need to know to trade equity options:  1.	Delta 2.	Gamma 3.	Theta 4.	Vega  If you have at least a modest understanding of these, you’ll be on your way to sweet, sweet tendies in no time. Now onto the gREEEE^EEEEEE^EEks   ---   ##Delta  Delta is the grand-daddy of them all. The Hugh Heffner of the Greeks. Most of you probably are familiar with delta, because it’s the easiest one. Easier than your sister, which is really saying something. **Delta represents the relative increase in the price of an option, given an increase in the price of the underlying.** When you buy or sell an option, the price change doesn’t exactly mirror the stock 1:1. Options expire at some point in the future. Stocks don’t expire.  The implication here is that an option is only valuable if you can exercise it for a profit. Logically, this means that deep ITM options will have a delta pretty close to +/-1 (depending on whether it’s a call or a put), while deep OTM options will have a delta pretty close to 0 (or 100/0, whatever convention you use, the only difference is where the decimal is). **Note:** Option deltas range from -1 to 1 (or -100 to 100 deltas). Calls have positive delta (0 to 1) while Puts have negative delta (-1 to 0).  If you’re seeing deltas on your trading platform that are not in this range, you’re probably seeing Dollar Delta, which is just:  Delta x Notional Shares (usually 100 per lot) x Price of Underlying  **Autist’s interpretation:** The easiest way to wrap your autistic brains around this is to think of delta as *roughly* the probability of the underlying stock price going beyond your strike at expiration. For example, an ATM call has around 50 deltas. That means you can intuitively view it as having a 50/50 chance of expiring in the money. An increase in the stock price would give you even greater chances, hence the delta of a slightly ITM call is a little over 50, and deep ITM calls are close to 100 deltas. An ATM Put has roughly -50 deltas. This doesn’t mean a -50% chance of expiring ITM you fucking idiot, it just means that your option value is negatively correlated to price increases.   ---    ##Gamma  Gamma is the least-hyped Greek out of all of them, but definitely one that could cause your portfolio to turn into a shitshow while you’re not paying attention. **Gamma represents the change in Delta, given a change in the underlying price.**  Gamma is the 2nd order mathematical derivative of price. It tells you how fast your delta will change when price moves happen. Just like speed and acceleration. The second one tells you the rate of change of the first. It can also be interpreted as a measure of convexity, telling you how flat or round something is. Like your flat-chested girlfriend has almost no titty gamma, while Kate Upton titties got gamma for days. Gamma is always positive, and is always largest ATM.  **Autist’s interpretation:** Think of gamma as the big swing when options go from being OTM to ITM or vice versa. So the next time you see that piece of shit stock hitting all time highs, think to yourself “Holy shit, this dumpster fire might actually moon, better YOLO on some calls real quick”, then it drops by $0.05 and your calls drop 50%, blame it on the gamma.   ---    ##Theta  Theta is the turtle of the greeks. Doesn’t move too fast, doesn’t do too much when you poke it with a stick, boring as fuck. But this is where the time value of options comes from, so it’s important that you know what it is. **Theta is the change in option price, given a 1 day change in time**.  Short option positions have positive theta. Long options positions have negative theta. This means that the marketable value of the  option decays each day it comes closer to the expiration date. Less time to expiry = less time to moon, which means people will pay less for it. This is essentially how options selling strategies make their profits. They bet that the price won’t move that much, and most of the time, they’re actually right, because dumb cucks like you are willing to pay those prices.  Like gamma, theta is also the largest when an option is ATM. As time passes, theta becomes larger and larger. The implication here being that the last week of an option’s life, theta will be exponentially larger.  **Autist’s interpretation:** Think of theta as the shot clock. It keeps ticking away, no matter if the game is exciting or boring. If it’s a really close game (i.e. the option is ATM), then the shot clock is pretty much the make or break thing for you. If the game is a blowout (option is OTM) then it doesn’t really matter that much. When it comes down to the final minute, and it’s make-it-or-break-it for your shitty, shitty, poorly thought out March Madness bracket selections, you’re literally ripping your hair out because you’re on the emotions express, screaming “WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT, REF? ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND?” and then cry and piss yourself in the corner. That’s the only time theta really matters.   ---   ##Vega  Possibly one of the most misunderstood Greeks, and 105% of the reason behind why RH faggots try to get their trades reversed. **Vega is the change in price of an option for a 1pt increase in the implied volatility of the underlying**.  Now, some of you faggots may know what implied volatility (IV) is, others think you do. No one actually does, because it’s a fucking made up concept in order to get the math to work. The short bus explanation is that implied volatility tells you how much people buying and selling options think that the underlying price has the potential to move in either direction before expiration.  I’m not going to go into how it’s backed out of the Black-Scholes pricing model, or how implied volatility actually represents an estimated annualized 1 standard deviation (68.27%) interval assuming a gaussian distribution of continuous time price movements (specifically addressed to all of you elitist NERDS out there, cash me in the comments, howbow dah?).  Implied volatility is the only unobservable and incalculable input to an option’s price. It’s literally made up. Historically, it hangs out somewhere between 5-10% above historical realized volatility, but when or why it jumps or drops is purely based on the dumb cucks who are trading the options.  The important distinction here is that **Implied Volatility tells you whether an option is relatively expensive or relatively cheap. Vega does not.** Vega just tells you how sensitive an option’s price is to changes in the will of the people.  Both calls and puts have positive vega. Intuitively, this means that when people think the market will move sharply in either direction, options increase in value, because people want protection (or phat gainz).  **Autist’s interpretation:** Vega tells you how much you’re fucked when people lose interest in a hot meme stock after it doesn’t moon, or when people unwad their fucking panties after some good ‘ol Thursday action.  ---   #In Conclusion  Hopefully you retards made it this far without wandering off to try and hump a doorknob. If so, congratulations, I hereby award you 10 good boy points. If there’s enough interest, and I can find more whiskey, I might do a part 2 on basic options strategies and how to completely misapply them.

You would end up paying a high APR, possibly go bankrupt and have failed to utilized credit card sign up bonuses adequately. As someone who frequents /r/churning I was thinking **IF** someone were to trade stocks by funding through credit cards what would be the best and *smartest* way to do that? So this is a short guide outlining a slight possibly to minimizing interest paid, transaction fees and having a slight return on your sign up bonuses.   **Credit Cards to Sign up For**  I would sign up for chase cards first because they tend to have a hard rejection rule for people with more than 5 cards within 24 months    *Chase Freedom [Sign-up Bonus: $150 on $500 | 0% APR for 15 months]   *Chase Freedom Unlimited [Sign-up Bonus: $150 on $500 | 0% APR for 15 months]   *Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards [Sign-up Bonus: $150 on $500 | 0% APR for 9 months]   *Wells Fargo Cashwise Visa Card [Sign-up Bonus: $200 on $1000 | 0% APR for 12 months]    *Bank of America Cash Rewards Credit Card [Sign-up: $150 on $500 | 0% APR on 12 months]   *American Express BlueCash Everyday Card [Sign-up: $150 on $1000 | 0% APR on 12 months]   *HSBC Cash Rewards MasterCard Card [Sign-up: $150 on $500 | 0% APR on 15 months]    Total Sign Up Bonuses : $1,100 on $4,500 spending (24% return to start off)   After applying to all of these credit cards, you would most likely be approved for only a handful. But you can utilize these cards by a couple of ways.   **Visa Gift Card (3% fee)**  **Venmo (3% fee)**  I would recommended doing Venmo, you can fund your transaction and send money to a friend or significant other from your phone and the sign up bonuses will off set the transaction costs. Venmo lets you send money by credit card for a fee of 3%.    Now ask your friend/family/S.O to send the money back either through venmo, Chase quickpay or cold hard cash.   Now, fund your account and trade.   Not only have you funded your account with a credit card without paying initial transaction costs, but you have 0% Interest for the next year or more.   *If you use the cash back earned to pay off your credit card debt you would owe about $3,400 while having spent $4,500 in funding towards your account*      "||False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||public||self|How to really trade stocks with credit card funding||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7i34e4/how_to_really_trade_stocks_with_credit_card/|promo_specified|||||||1512614271.0||||||||||False|||||||2017-12-07|EXPR

It was another slow evening of news other than the German Aug factory order numbers (which were very strong although the euro and Eurozone stocks are both in the red), a few US earnings reports (COST and YUMC), andsome M&amp;A (GIMO, HON, JWN, PENN/PNK, SNCR, and more). The overall macro narrativeremains the same as it was at the Thurs close (see below for an update on the macro narrative as well as potential upcoming risks). The major Asian indices generally saw gains – TPX +0.28%, NKY +0.3%, Hang Seng +0.28%, HSCEI +0.54%, Taiwan +0.14%, Australia +1.04%, and India +0.5-7% (mainland China and Korea were both closed). There weren’t any huge themes in Asia although Macau casino stocks were weak in HK on back of underwhelming Golden Week visitor numbers (autos and financials led HK on the upside). Australia’s 1% rally was led by banks, miners, and telecoms. The major Eurozone indices are trading off small (~10-20bp); autos are outperforming while banks, retail, energy, and utilities lag. The GBP is extending its losses from Thurs amid more uncertainty around UK PM May (the DXY spiked ~50bp Thurs and is up small so far Fri morning). US S&amp;P futures are trading down 1-2 points. * Calendar for Fri 10/6 – the focus will be on the US jobs report for Sept (8:30amET), US wholesale inventories/trade sales for Aug (10amET), US consumer credit for Aug (3pmET), and Fed speakers (Kaplan 8:30amET on CNBC, Bostic 9:15amET, Dudley 12:15pmET, Kaplan 12:45pmET, and Bullard 1pmET). o US jobs preview – there is very little anticipation or focus on the Sept jobs report (Fri morning 8/6 8:30amET) as 1) most are anticipating large storm-related distortions and 2) at this point in the cycle it only requires ~75K monthly adds to keep the UR steady (as was discussed in this JPMorgan report http://bit.ly/2fbT6cE). The St is in print at +80K for adds (vs. ADP for Sept at +135K and Aug BLS +156K) w/a 4.4% UR (unchanged w/Aug) and wages +0.3% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y (vs. Aug +0.1% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y). It’s very difficult to see the Sept BLS report changing the near-term US monetary policy trajectory (w/ongoing normalization and a FF hike on 12/13). The potential for a hike on 11/1 is very low and if anything the Sept CPI on Fri 10/13 may be a more important data point than jobs on Fri 10/6. Instead, the bigger Fed uncertainty has nothing to do w/data or policy but instead concerns staffing (i.e. who will be the next chair? A Trump announcement could come as soon as next week – Powell and Warsh are the frontrunners according to media reports w/the former appearing to have a slight edge).  #Top Headlines for Friday  * Eco data recap for Fri morning 10/6 – the big data came out of Germany where factory orders for Aug beat expectations by a wide margin (orders +3.6% M/M vs. the St +0.7% and +7.8% Y/Y vs. the St +4.7%). See JPMorgan’s comments on the German data (http://bit.ly/2y42sh4). Japan’s wage inflation figures for Aug were soft, as expected (http://bit.ly/2kuygr0). o Fed chair – markets would be comfortable w/any of the main candidates (including Powell, Warsh, Cohn, Yellen, etc.) w/the exception of one person: John Taylor. Bloomberg. o Fed update – Kansas City Fed President George spoke Thurs night and said the US economy needed further rates hikes (http://cnb.cx/2kqTiqj). JPMorgan’s Mike Feroli published an updated FOMC hawk/dove chart following the confirmation of Quarles (http://bit.ly/2z1jSti). o Japan’s “Party of Hope” unveils an economic agenda that pledges to rely less on aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ghahXu o AUD hit as RBA’s Harper doesn’t rule out a rate cut in a WSJ article. http://on.wsj.com/2xW3nkD * UK PM May the subject of more speculation amid disclosure of plot to topple her; former party chairman, Grant Shapps, said May’s leadership should now be challenged. Reuters http://reut.rs/2yMrmzB * Spain/Catalonia – Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of the Catalan parliament’s regional session scheduled for Mon; Catalonia had planned on declaring independence at the session. Reuters http://reut.rs/2xlDfjC o Spain’s gov’t will change rules and make it easier for firms to move their legal base out of Catalonia – Reuters http://reut.rs/2z1WQCF * Tax update - there is a lot of focus on taxes in the US as the Senate Budget Committee (right at the Thurs close) and the full House (at ~1pmET Thurs afternoon) advance budget resolutions (the full Senate will presumably vote within the next two weeks). This is a necessary step in the tax process (as these resolutions contain the reconciliation instructions allowing tax to pass via a simple majority in the Senate) but also a relatively minor one. Far more complicated will be agreeing on rates, deduction schedules, deficits, etc., and if anything all the press in the last few days and weeks point to divisions within the GOP on these matters being larger than anticipated. o Schumer warns that the proposal to eliminate the SALT deduction will kill the GOP tax plan – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xXX8KL o GOP desire to repeal the estate tax runs into resistance - from Republicans. As a result this piece of the 9/27 tax blueprint (among others) may wind up being scrapped - WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2gf9G8E o Fed officials express concern over tax plans – Fed officials warned the tax plan may only provide a temporary boost to growth while fueling inflation and driving debt to unsustainable levels – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xWMrdG * Republican headaches keep growing as donors withhold money, a tax consensus fails to materialize, and “establishment” figures depart the scene (Strange losing to Moore, Corker retiring, etc.). Republican leaders are increasingly concerned about the party’s grip on the House and Senate should it fail to pass a tax bill. Leaders “fear that the inchoate populism that Mr. Trump personifies, and which Mr. Bannon is attempting to weaponize against incumbents, is on the march” – NYT http://nyti.ms/2y3lUKT * Trump looks to jolt NAFTA – the White House is considering a proposal that would represent a radical shift to the principles underlying NAFTA. According to rule changes being considered, automobiles would need to have a specific level of US-made content in order to qualify for tariff breaks (right now autos only need to have a specific level of content from within the NAFTA region). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2y4LXlo * Trump makes cryptic comment ahead of a dinner with US military leaders. Trump said the dinner might represent “the calm before the storm”. Asked repeatedly by reporters to clarify his comments, Trump said, “You’ll find out” – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2xXI2r6 * Trump was “furious” over NBC’s Tillerson “moron” article; John Kelly was forced to rearrange his schedule and stayed in Washington in order to try and calm tensions – NBC. http://nbcnews.to/2fOGx3B * Iran/Trump – Trump will “decertify” the Iran nuclear accord next week (speech on 10/12) and declare the agreement as not being in the US national interest according to the Washington Post (article out at ~2:40pmET Thurs afternoon). This is consistent w/what the AP and Politico reported earlier in the week. Note that Trump’s 10/12 declarations won’t end the Iranian nuclear pact as it will be up to Congress whether re-impose sanctions on Tehran (and Trump will hold off on recommending such a step). Washington Post http://wapo.st/2z1zeOw o Decertifying the Iran Deal Wouldn’t Have to Kill It – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2y40dKY * North Korea – US lawmakers are pressuring the Trump White House to toughen sanctions against North Korea – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xlKdVQ * The Economist's lead article this week speaks to sentiment at the moment and this is one of the big reasons why stocks are proving to be so resilient. ""Asset prices are high across the board. Is it time to worry?"" (http://econ.st/2xVXOjv). o The WSJ notes that a key European junk-bond index is now yielding less than 10yr US TSYs although it offers a reasonable explanation for this ostensibly irrational price level – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xkwYVb * Company-specific news update from Thurs night. There were a few earnings reports out Thurs AMC but for the most part it was another slow evening. COST EPS beats thanks to better SG&amp;A and favorable tax while GMs were light; Sept same-store-sales beat w/upside in the US (the stock ended down 3% during the Thurs after-hours trading session). YUMC’s results came in ahead of expectations (EPS/same-store-sales) and it increased capital return. SNCR reentered M&amp;A talks w/Siris Capital (Siris is looking to buy SNCR’s Intralinks and may take a ~20% equity stake in SNCR); SNCR ended up ~27% during the Thurs after-hours trading session. According to the WSJ, HON is pursuing an acquisition of Evoqua Water Tech in a deal that could be worth $3B (http://on.wsj.com/2yseCSp). The WSJ reported (during trading on Thurs http://on.wsj.com/2xjE24p) on merger talks between PENN and PNK (the firms have been unable to agree to terms but PENN is still interested in buying PNK). * JWN buyout not completely dead – the Nordstrom family is exploring a new deal structure w/Leonard Green that would involve less debt. The family is trying to raise more equity (although it isn’t clear where the money will come from). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ggTvbh * GIMO – Elliot’s takeover talks w/the company have ground to a halt according to Reuters over price disagreements – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fNCepo * SUM, ASHG – SUM has made a rival bid for ASHG as it looks to scuttle the existing Ash Grove-CRH PLC transaction. Ash Grove’s board said the offer could result in a superior proposal and that it would engage in talks with the third party. Bloomberg. * AMZN: the one market where Amazon is failing to dominate: Hollywood. The WSJ discusses AMZN’s failure to become a force in content. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xZcJtr * Macau casino stocks slump during Fri trading as Golden Week visitor numbers disappoint expectations – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2fOuGmd  #Identifying risks – what could go wrong?  * Reflation enthusiasm is undercut by less aggressive CB normalization, dramatic curve flattening, and/or a softening in nominal growth. Of all the reflation pieces (monetary policy normalization, expansionary fiscal policy, firming inflation, and ongoing real growth strength), the last piece (real growth) is increasingly being taken for granted. * Bank investors wind up focusing too much on reflation/yields (which are tailwinds) but miss weakening credit (higher provisions) and tepid loan growth. * The first speech by the next Fed chair unsettles sentiment (assuming the chair isn’t Yellen). * The tax process slows in Washington as Republicans prove incapable of reaching a consensus on rates, deductions, and deficits. * Paul Ryan decides to “pull a Boehner”, stepping down as Speaker out of frustration with his inability to pass legislation. * The final tax bill results in materially higher rates for upper-income Americans. * May winds up stepping down as UK PM, sowing ongoing Brexit uncertainty. * Abe does much worse than anticipated during the upcoming Japan election (10/22). * North Korea conducts an above-ground nuclear bomb test (or even worse, an atmospheric test). * Iran decides to resume its nuclear weapons program, sparking an immediate escalation of Middle East geopolitical tensions (Trump’s Iran speech is coming up on 10/12). * Washington introduces (or threatens to introduce) tough new regulations aimed at internet/social media companies following the Russia election investigations (note that US internet giants will be testifying before Congress on 11/1). * Prominent members of the Trump team decide to leave the gov’t (the market would be particularly sensitive to Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and/or Cohn departing; recent media reports suggest the Tillerson-Trump relationship is particularly strained).  #Macro Update  * The pro-reflation bias commenced back on 9/11 and has been propelled ever since by ongoing real growth strength, firming inflation, normalizing monetary policy/rhetoric, and expansionary fiscal policy (in particular in the US w/the 9/27 tax blueprint but also in Germany following that country’s election outcome and fin min change). * This enthusiasm can extend for a few more weeks but the ECB/BOE decisions (on 10/26 and 11/2, respectively) will mark the culmination of a series of pro-reflation catalysts/developments and thus the trade may enter a period of extended consolidation around those central bank events. * Meanwhile the nuances of this present reflation process aren’t being appreciated – growth and corporate earnings are late-cycle (not early), multiples are already rich (although not necessarily ridiculous), inflation is only very gradually firming to target, the economy faces enormous structural headwinds in the form of labor supply and productivity growth, and while central banks are normalizing policy will stay extremely accommodative for years to come (the structural headwinds and slow tightening pace will prevent yields from materially rising and curves from significantly steepening). * The tenor of sentiment is beginning to evolve and there is definitely greater frustration w/people being forced to participate in a tape many don’t particularly love at present levels – this helps fuel runs such has occurred over the last few weeks (the SPX hasn’t closed in the red since Mon 9/25) but it also makes for a precarious setup w/a lot of weak “renters” who will be quick to sell the minute momentum pauses. * Bottom Line: the lack of major catalysts is helping the rally propagate and the calendar is relatively clear until earnings (which kick off w/banks on Thurs 10/12). The reflation impetus will likely stay in place into the ECB/BOE (10/26 and 11/2, respectively) after which a consolidation (at least) is likely (note that a lot of the “easy” tax steps are occurring now – the blueprint on 9/27, the budget resolutions, etc. However, reaching a consensus on rates, deductions, and deficits will be extremely difficult and this will become more apparent later in Oct and into Nov, around the same time as the ECB/BOE decisions).  #Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Oct 9  * Calendar for the week of 10/9 – overall it should be a relatively slow week although a few items are in focus. The current reflation emphasis makes the US CPI on Fri 10/13 prob. the single most important eco data point of the week but there are other numbers in focus (German trade/IP for Aug and China imports/exports for Sept). The CQ3 earnings season kicks off in earnest with the banks on Thurs and Friday. Away from scheduled events, media reports suggest Catalonia could formally declare independence on Mon (although this could easily be delayed following court challenges and as the region’s leaders seek a settlement w/Madrid) while the White House may unveil its infrastructure spending blueprint during the week of 10/9 (http://bit.ly/2wwiop9). South Korean security officials have warned that North Korea may fire additional missiles between 10/10 and 10/18 while Trump’s Fed chair selection could come soon (media reports suggest Powell and Warsh are the two frontrunners). Trump is expected to deliver an Iranian policy speech on/around Thurs 10/12 during which he will declare the nuclear deal as no longer being in the US national interest. HON has said it will announce its formal portfolio review decision prior to earnings (media reports, including on CNBC, suggest it will retain its aerospace unit). * Calendar for Mon 10/9 – the day should be pretty quiet owing to the US Columbus Day holiday (equities will be open but fixed income is closed). The focus will be on the China FX reserve numbers for Sept (Fri night/Sat morning 10/7), the China Caixin services PMI for Sept (Sun night/Mon morning), Germany’s industrial production for Aug (2amET), and earnings (LVMH reports results after the European close). * Calendar for Tues 10/10 – the focus will be on the German trade figures for Aug (2amET), a bunch of analyst meetings (including TECD, Santander, WDAY, and WMT), the PG shareholder meeting (at which the Trian/Peltz board seat request will be voted on), and earnings (CUDA after the close). * Calendar for Wed 10/11 – the focus will be on the US JOLTs report for Aug (10amET), Fed minutes from the 9/20 meeting (2pmET), analyst meetings (KR), and earnings (DAL, BLK, FAST, and OZRK before the open).   * Calendar for Thurs 10/12 – the focus will be on Eurozone IP for Aug (5amET), the US PPI for Sept (8:30amET), Trump’s Iran speech, analyst meetings (BOX, HPQ, LSCC, and WDC), and earnings (C, DPZ, JPM, LNN, Sky PLC, and Tata Consultancy pre-open). * Calendar for Fri 10/13 – the focus will be on China’s imports/exports for Sept (Thurs night/Fri morning), the US CPI for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Sept (8:30amET), the Michigan Confidence numbers for Oct (10amET), US business inventories for Aug (10amET), analyst meetings (SAFM), and earnings (BAC, DRFG, FHN, FRC, JBHT, Man Group, PNC, and WFC pre-open).  #Catalysts – big events to watch over the coming months  * China mainland markets closed Mon 10/2-Fri 10/6 for the National Day holiday. * US jobs report for Sept – Fri 10/6. * US infrastructure spending - the Trump White House may unveil its long-anticipated infrastructure plan during the week of 10/9 according to House Transport chairman Rep. Bill Shuster. * North Korea - South Korea’s national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said he expected Pyongyang to act around Oct. 10 and 18 (Reuters). * WMT analyst meeting – Tues 10/10 (note that KR has an analyst meeting the next day, Wed 10/11). * PG shareholder meeting – Tues 10/10 (decision to be made on Peltz’s board seat request). * Fed minutes – minutes from the 9/20 meeting will be released Wed 10/11. 2pmET. * HON – the co will announce its portfolio review decision before earnings in Oct. * Iran - Trump is planning to deliver an Iran policy speech on 10/12 and he is expected to say that the landmark 2015 nuclear deal is no longer in the U.S. national security interest (AP) * Bank earnings – the CQ3 earnings season kicks off w/Citigroup and JPM Thurs morning 10/12 while BAC, PNC, and WFC all report Fri 10/13. * US inflation – the Sept CPI will hit Fri 10/13. * IMF/World Bank - 2017 Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund. Oct 13-15 in Washington. * CQ3 earnings – the week of Mon 10/16 is the first busy week of the CQ3 reporting season. * Fed chair decision during the week of 10/16? Based on Trump’s “two to three” weeks comment (on Fri 9/29), his decision on a Fed chair could come as soon as the week of 10/16 (this week is also the first busy period of the CQ3 earnings season, the deadline for Trump to rule on the Iran nuclear deal, and the beginning of the China National Congress on 10/18). Media reports suggest the Fed chair frontrunners are Warsh and Powell followed by Yellen and Cohn. * China - the National Congress of the Communist Party of China starts Oct 18. * China Q3 GDP and Sept retail sales, IP, and FAI (Wed night/Thurs morning) – Thurs morning 10/19. * EU leaders hold summit in Brussels. Oct 19-20. Brussels. * Japan – the country will hold snap elections on Sun 10/22. * Flash PMIs for Oct – Tues 10/24 * ECB meeting/press conf. Thurs Oct 26.

Mon 10/30. * US wage inflation – Q3 ECI (Employment Cost Index) Tues 10/31. * Fed meeting – decision Wed 11/1 (no press conf. or supplemental). * FB/TWTR testifying before Senate on Russia and the election – Wed 11/1. * BOE decision – Thurs 11/2.

Fri 11/24. * OPEC meeting – the next formal OPEC leaders meeting is Nov 30 (a decision on extending the production agreement beyond Mar ’18 could be reached at this gathering). * US gov’t funding/debt ceiling – current legislation funds the gov’t and suspends the debt ceiling until 12/8 (the debt ceiling is unlikely to become binding again until “well into” 2018). * Alabama special Senate election – Tues 12/12. * Fed meeting – decision Wed Dec 13. There will be a press conf. and supplemental. The Fed is expected to hike rates at this meeting. * ECB meeting/press conf.

Not forgetting to mention the continued YoY strength in revenue with Paypal and Shopify, this could hurt Square's market share, or be a glimpse into the continued growth.   **Subscription and Services-based Revenue**  Square Capital has been a new tool that's provided great leverage to their revenue growth and customer longevity, [""Square Capital has provided loans to 40,000 businesses totaling $251 million, up 64 percent annually""](https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2017/Square-2017-Q1-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) ***I think this where SQ will continue to wow***, already having a such as loyal following, having a quick and easy way to borrow at a fair rate is such a great arm to add for continuing to borrow and attract new borrowers who otherwise don't want to or can't qualify through a bank. NOTE: This is the best alternative to something like, say, a credit card b/c it offers greater flexibility through the SQ ecosystem but, so they can continue to service on both ends, ie, charge fees to the seller and borrower of these loans.   Caviar, Square's on demand food delivery service, is still scaling, orders more than doubled YoY, partnered with 3000 restaurants already, could be more of a thorn if it continues to burn more than it earns and is like facilitating a startup within a startup, but, could always be a good sale or just get them into more merchants.  **Hardware**  This is really just a small part of their revenue, but, has been either flat or considerably down due to being backlogged from orders of their new readers, etc. last year. Could pick back up and surprise, but how much value will this add? I don't think very much.    I don't see why they can't continue to drive at a 31% YoY growth rate, but, I think the biggest hurting AND biggest helping factor is internally, ie, minimizing their operating expenses and net losses. Tons of upside, but, are they biting off more they can chew with their guidance??   I think so.

Uses for these loan products include home remodels, durable good purchases, travel and continuing education. Its online marketplace provides investors with various investing tools, such as automated investing tool and self-directed investing tool. It maintains a secondary loan market on its marketplace where investors can transfer the loans they hold prior to maturity at the fair value of the remaining loans.""  Sounds good and what not, but here is the crazy part: According to Nasdaq.com, they had a growth rate of ~100% last year, 12% this year, and projected growth of 60% next year. All that with a P/E of 8.43 and a forward P/E for 2018 of 5.27 (A FUCKING ONLINE BUSINESS WITH A P/E OF 5....). This gives them an amazing PEG ratio.   The stock is trading ~30% below its 52 week high. All I need to figure out is what the default rate on the loans is (if someone finds it, let me know).  As the Chinese economy and its middle class grows, demand for loans should grow a lot as more and more people will be able to afford the interest and to pay back the loans over time.

Sound familiar?    The deal went through, and then Dollar Tree (allegedly) staffed the 330 locations with terrible employees, opened locations nearby the 330 stores and cut into their profits forcing them to sell themselves to Dollar General this spring after not being able to compete.    Having this as a precedent there is no way the FTC in good conscience can approve the exact same deal for fear WBA will do the same to Fred's and open locations near them.    Personally I would allow the merger because competition is fierce and heating up with AMZN entering the space, but Dollar Tree has put a bad taste in the mouths of the FTC sorority, and this deal SHALL.

I then clearly recall selling it a few minutes later because it was not moving at all and I felt it was a bit risky to take on when I had no idea what the company actually did except from something about vending machines. Well, I looked back at it later only to see that was was 10% down from where I bought at. I was excited for spotting the deathtrap in the making and patted myself on the back for selling before it was a loss. Except that I didn't sell it.  Thursday I didn't log into my account at all and it wasn't until 5 minutes ago that I decided to log in and buy something only to see that I still had my entire CVNA position, and that I was up $2,000 on it. Just sold it all at market this time to lock on those gains. Thank the investing gods.

Bowel movements can be a sensitive topic for people who live with CIC to discuss, often leaving them feeling a lack of validation from those with whom they may interact.  The Poop Troop is part of a broader disease education initiative launched by Synergy, called Confront Constipation, designed to raise the understanding and increase dialogue on managing CIC. The Poop Troop emoji keyboard app is available for iOS and Android and can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store and Google Play store. Once installed, the Poop Troop can be accessed directly from the standard keyboard page on a user’s smartphone.  CIC is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 33 million Americans and an estimated 14 percent of the global population. In addition to causing infrequent, hard stools and other physical symptoms such as straining, abdominal bloating and discomfort, CIC can adversely affect an individual’s quality of life, including increasing stress levels and anxiety.  As the use of smartphones becomes nearly universal, recent research has shown that more than 90 percent of people use emojis in their day-to-day digital conversations. The Poop Troop is inspired by the highly popular poop emoji, but reimagined for people living with CIC. Each character in the free keyboard app represents a type of bowel movement—from constipation, to normal, to diarrhea—and an emotion that people with CIC often associate with each, including “stressed,” “depressed,” “angry,” “relieved,” “cool,” “euphoric,” “surprised,” “concerned” and “embarrassed.”  “Many people with CIC feel embarrassed or uncomfortable talking about their symptoms with those closest to them, so they often suffer in silence,” said Julie Holcombe, Senior Director, Marketing, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. “Our hope is that the Poop Troop can help make difficult conversations easier for people with CIC, while raising awareness around the impact of CIC beyond those living with this complex disorder.”  “Maintaining an open dialogue with your healthcare provider is one of the first steps to developing an appropriate treatment plan for CIC,” said Kimberly D. Orleck, MPH, RD, PA-C, Physician Assistant at Atlanta Gastroenterology Associates. “These emojis are not intended to serve as a diagnostic or a medical tool, however the Poop Troop may provide patients with a more comfortable, visual way to communicate their physical symptoms and related state of mind to their healthcare provider, which then may lead to more productive conversation around their health and CIC treatment goals.”||False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|Time to go all in SGYP||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/63t4l3/time_to_go_all_in_sgyp/|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'JVa1WU9VsT7DyxltV0YJtNvuOK2EugwCU0q9LHudgic', 'resolutions': [{'height': 43, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/-qlewvMv8-fbQYR2bVXj3fqfsYrJquwlP2wny2Zzwcg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=8698bcbf5b7c8256e8ddca9040639b8b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 86, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/-qlewvMv8-fbQYR2bVXj3fqfsYrJquwlP2wny2Zzwcg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=4bc529b0bcab0e146486631a42f35947', 'width': 216}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/-qlewvMv8-fbQYR2bVXj3fqfsYrJquwlP2wny2Zzwcg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=40d315232fb4fa27b6d20f781d54b25c', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 192, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/-qlewvMv8-fbQYR2bVXj3fqfsYrJquwlP2wny2Zzwcg.jpg?s=b73a424b0c4fb8503a7b8a780e6d4a19', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||0.0||||||||False||||1421281048.0|{}|{}|2017-04-06|EXPR

So far the only publicly traded company that I know of that makes suppressors and firearms that will take said suppressors is $RGR.  Who else does, specifically is there a publicly traded AR-15 suppressor manufacturer?  Why?  Why ask why, you should already know how this is going to go.  Every mother fucker and their dog is going to buy suppressors and firearms that can use them once this law passes with the express knowledge the that Democrats will repeal the law as soon as they are in office (approx 3.5 years from now).  Obviously not everyone has the $1k+ that it will take to buy said guns now, but still I'd expect heavy sales over the course of the year and maybe another kick towards the next election.  ||False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|Hearing Protection Act, or Suppressors For All||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/63i8ot/hearing_protection_act_or_suppressors_for_all/||||||||||0.0||||||||False||||1453663689.0|{}|{}|2017-04-05|EXPR

I know DD has been done on this before, however I feel like I expressed the cons and pros better than others. Stock ticker 2.9 at time of writing. Note I am a Liberal.   NAK is a stock ticker you may of heard of before, it stands for Northern Dynasty Minerals. Northern Dynasty Minerals is a company that is attempting to gain permission to mine the Pebble Project in southwest Alaska. The Pebble Project is noteworthy for having the second largest deposit of minerals in human history. What is preventing NAK from mining this wealth of minerals is the EPA, various Alaskan activist groups, and the local salman industry. What is driving the stock’s price of 3 dollars per share from its previous low of .1 cents per share is the new president of America, Donald Trump.    “The Pebble deposit is one of the greatest stores of mineral wealth ever discovered. The current resource estimate includes 6.44 billion tonnes in the measured and indicated categories containing 57 billion lb copper, 70 million oz gold, 3.4 billion lb molybdenum and 344 million oz silver; and 4.46 billion tonnes in the inferred category, containing 24.5 billion lb copper, 37 million oz gold, 2.2 billion lb molybdenum and 170 million oz silver(1). Quantities of palladium and rhenium also occur in the deposit.”    http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/Pebble.asp     Let me start with what is preventing the Pebble Project from becoming a reality. The biggest hurdle for the Pebble Project has been the EPA. The EPA has been rightfully wary that the Pebble Project could permanently damage the environment, in 2014 the EPA released a report that the construction of the Pebble Project could permanently ruin Bristol Bay’s 480 million dollar salman industry, as well as the unmeasurable worth of the environment of Bristol Bay. Besides the EPA, numerous Alaskan activist groups fight Northern Dynasty Minerals. The governor of Alaska has been said to be against the Pebble Project, as well as the Speaker of the House.    https://www.epa.gov/bristolbay/bristol-bay-assessment-final-report-2014     Alongside the growing stock ticker, there has been a growing optimism for the Pebble Project with the election of Donald Trump. Trump is noted to be heavily support the return of blue collar jobs regardless of the situations around them. Trump has recently utilized his executive orders to brute force the pipelines in reality regardless of the environmental impacts, and legal implications of the matter at hand. Trump has also given his approval to the Pebble Project, showing that Trump is at least aware of the Project. Northern Dynasty’s main hurdle, the EPA, is being neutered by the Trump Administration, with Trump taking direct actions to destroy the EPA, and nominating a corporate owned climate change denier to the head of the EPA.    http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/trump-keystone-xl-dakota-access-pipelines-executive-actions/index.html  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-23/northern-dynasty-says-it-has-trump-backing-seeking-new-partner   http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-administration-orders-epa-media-blackout-contract-freeze/    The real question is, will democrats choose this as rock to die for, or will they choose to fight another day. As with a Republican president, a Republican Congress, and a Republican Senate, the Democrats have little power to stop Trump. With a normal Republican president, I would put little hopes on this project to succeed. Trump has shown that with his inauguration speech, that he does not seek to unify this country, but to please his voter base. Sadly for the environment, Trump’s drive to fulfill the expectations of his voters, even if it will cost our country in the long run. Even if the project does not come into fruition, I have full certainty that Trump will eventually at least vocally express support, driving the stock price to the moon. If I have not convinced you, then think. What sounds better to Trump, being able to tweet that he has created 100,000 jobs, and added 5 billion dollars to our GDP, or that he prevented a possibility of immeasurable amounts of permanent damage to the Alaskan environment.  ||False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|A more In-Depth DD on NAK||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5qcakh/a_more_indepth_dd_on_nak/||||||||1485471293.0||0.0||||||||False||||1376538675.0|{}|{}|2017-01-26|EXPR

I know, I know, it's hard to believe a man as suave as myself could have problems with women, but at the time, I was struggling to express myself, outleash my sexual creativity and fully express my repressed emotions. I lusted for a bodalicious and voluptuous women with whom I could start a family. I would treat our children exactly like I treat my stocks: with love, care, attention and a complete and absolute devotion.  Barring that, I would have settled for finally losing my virginity. Up until that point, the closest I had been to losing it was after investing into Valeant and going to the annual meeting.  Anyway, to make a short story, one critical topic in the PUA scene is the ""alpha"" concept. If you spend years and years studying seminars, training videos and encyclopedias, you will learn that being an alpha is all about the image you project.  And this brings us to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). At its core, Alphabet is made from two words:  Alpha, which means a leader, an innovator, a winner, the top dog etc.  Bet, which means yolo, but less hardcore (aka pointless).  This brings the obvious question: does a true alpha really need to label itself an alpha? Winners win, they don't spend their day going around telling others that they are alpha. Imagine if I called myself ""Alphacomeu"" or something silly like that. You would call it silly and stop investing in what I'm investing. At its core, Google is simply trying too hard. What exactly are they trying to prove by calling themselves Alpha?  And this brings me to my next point. Back when I was young and still had hope left in my life (I was a very naive child), there was a pizzeria near my house that served some of the worst pizza in the world. Every two weeks or so, it closed due to health code violations. Eventually, people caught on what was going on and stopped going there. So what did the pizzeria do? They changed their name, of course! Hoping people would forget! ""Oh they have a different name, I guess it's a different place now!""  And then again, they didn't change their name to ""Alphapizzeria."" Even a shitty pizzeria store had less to prove than Google, apparently.  So anyway, why exactly did Google did that? Generally speaking, companies try to develop some kind of brand appeal. It makes no sense to get a product out, spend billions marketing it for years and then change your name. Imagine if Apple started calling itself ""Persimmon"" or ""Durian"" or something like that. Imagine if they no longer the iPhone the iPhone, but the AlphaPhone. People who laugh, rightfully so.  All in all, you have to wonder just what exactly Google is trying to hide by changing its name.  Perhaps they are simply trying to distract investors from failing revenues, lack of business vision and dying businesses. The truth is that Google is getting ripped to shreds in every facet of its business, from its search engine that is quickly dying to a browser than is being used less and less and a video sharing website that has never been profitable and will never be. And speaking on Youtube, another advantage of changing the company's name was avoiding all the lawsuits. All those people suing Google for copyright infringement/whatever? Well, they're gone; Google doesn't exist anymore.  I believe Google was doomed the minute it announced that change and have been shorting it every since. Companies do not make that kind of change except as a last resort. Every company I know of that changed its name failed afterwards. Because if you have a wining business, you keep your winning business. If you don't believe me, check out what happened to Research in motion after they changed their name to Blackberry.  Back to Google - it is announcing earnings tomorrow, January 26th, 2017, after market closes, and they are going to be terrible. In simple words: Google is dying and its earnings will show exactly that. But even barring that, Alphabet is way too expensive. At $800 per share, it is literally worth AAPL ($120), TSLA($244), NFLX ($138.60) and MSFT ($62) together! Do you really think this company is worth that much? Yeah, I don’t think so.  In every field, Google is getting destroyed. Android has been relegated to the status of “garbage” ever since the Galaxy Note fiasco. FACT: Nobody uses an Android phone by choice. Let’s face it guys, if you could afford something other than an Android, you wouldn’t have an Android. It’s like people who drive Subarus: if you could afford something other than a Subaru, you wouldn’t drive a Subaru. Youtube has never been profitable and never will be, at this point it’s a liability to Google and nobody uses Gmail since Podesta got hacked and people learned how unsecure Gmail is. The only thing Google has left is the most annoying part of it: ads.  Let’s face it, Adwords is 99% of Google’s revenues. Is it fair that a company worth over a trillion dollars now depends entirely on ONE product that can easily be copied by anyone in an afternoon? ""Oh, advertising, how innovative!"" Furthermore, ad blockers are so commonplace now (and getting more prevalent) that you stand better chance to make money by betting on Hillary Clinton winning the next elections.  The biggest problem with Adwords is that ads are nothing new. I was reading a book on gladiators and even back then, there were ads. So what exactly did Google invent? Furthermore, ecommerce is getting more and more segmented and soon ads will become obsolete. People are starting to learn where to buy what they want and no longer buy from random online website. If you want books, you type Amazon.com. If you want computer parts, you type Newegg.com. Etc. ""Googling"" or ""Alphabetting"" stuff has been obsolete.  Soon, nobody will need to Google things anymore because of artificial intelligence. If you want something, you can just ask Siri if you have an iPhone. Or you ask people on Facebook, an actually good company (see: earnings later next month).  All in all, Google's biggest mistake was failing to purchase Groupon a couple of years ago. By offering just $6B for a company that is worth far more than that, it failed to secure a critical business segment. This was the beginning of the end, only exacerbated by their lack of innovativeness. Seriously, name me one thing Google invented in the last 5 years. Google Buzz? Google Wave? Google +1? Yeah, I thought so.  No wonder they tried to hide all that by changing their name! By calling itself ""Alphabet,"" Google believe it is the ""absolute bet."" In a way, it kind of is: if you bet on it going down! The only thing ""alpha"" about ""Alphabet"" is how bad they are going to crash post-earnings when investors really the pile of cards that Google is is about to crumble!  VERDICT: Massively short Google through earnings for some easy money. Also, uninstall Chrome and stop using Google.com to put further pressure on their earnings.

Eco data was solid out of Germany and Taiwan but none of those numbers are altering the domestic narrative (the China Dec FX reserve figures were about inline). On the political front GOP support for the “repeal-without-replace” ACA strategy appears to be waning (which is likely neutral for the S&amp;P although could be an indirect positive to the extent it preserves political capital for Trump to expend elsewhere such as on tax reform).  • Calendar – the focus for Mon 1/9 will be on US consumer credit for Nov (3pmET), a few Fed speakers (Rosengren and Lockhart), some earnings (AYI, CMC, GPN pre-open and APOL, CUDA, and WDFC after the close), and conferences (ICR and JPM Healthcare).  • Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are off ~40-50bp. Chemicals, banks, insurance, media, real estate, healthcare, telecoms, and energy are all lagging while autos, basic resources, and tech are outperforming.  • FX – the DXY rebounded Fri and that strength is persisting into Mon (the DXY is up ~20bp). The USD is up a lot vs. the GBP (the GBP is down ~100bp) following remarks from PM May over the weekend. The CNY/CNH both saw weakness Mon following the China FX data out over the weekend.  • Treasuries – 2yr yields are flattish while 10 and 30yr yields are down ~2 and 3bp.  • Asia – trading was relatively quiet in Asia w/Japan closed for a holiday. The other markets were mixed: Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.25%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.54%, Shenzhen +0.3%, CSI 300 +0.48%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.32%), Korea (KOSPI -0.02%), Australia (ASX 200 +0.9%), and India (down ~10bp for the major indices). There wasn’t a lot of major Asia-specific news other than the China Dec FX reserve figures (about inline) and the Taiwan trade figures (which hit after the close and were solid).  • Hong Kong - Macau was the clear outperformer +2.9% while Cement -0.55% and Coal -0.4% lagged. COLI +1.4% moved higher after its project Kai Tak No.1 (II) received ~1,500 reservations for 125 units available, 11x oversubscribed. HK property names remained well bid despite the recent 6-7% rally on demand recovery, technical breakout and improving funding, CKP +0.71% SHK +0.6%. Large dispersion amongst Energy names with Petrochina making new high +2.3% while CNOOC declined 0.9%. China gas names were well bid after media reported Air Products has placed a bid to acquire Yindge Gases, all large caps reacted positively ENN Energy +4.15% China Res Gas +6.2% China Gas Holdings +5.26%. Macau names put on strong performances driven by external broker comments and ahead of positive seasonality (Chinese New Year), Sands +2.67% Wynn +3% Galaxy +4.26%. In the financials, we saw some risk-off with all Chinese Insurers offered China Life -0.5% CPIC - 0.54%; at the same time AIA +1.23% outperformed mainly driven by its defensive feature. Autos were very active with Geely +3.8% announcing a profit warning (more than double the earnings in FY17) and GWM +1.24% announcing a target of 1.25m units for FY17.  • South Korea – Samsung Electronics extended its gains from last week following the Thurs night upside earnings report (up another 2.82%) while Hynix did very well too (up 3.23%). This was offset by weakness elsewhere – NAVER -2.5%, KEP -2.27%, POSCO -2.4%, AMOREPACIFIC -4%, etc.  • Taiwan – the TAIEX ended down 0.32%. A lot of the large-cap tech names finished in the red (Largan -3.26%, Hon Hai -0.36%, MediaTek -1.36%, Novatek -2.73%, etc) although there were some pockets of green (Quanta +1.99%, Inventec +4.46%, AUO +2.39%, Foxconn +0.71%). TSMC ended flat ahead of its earnings later this week.  #Top Headlines for Monday  • German eco numbers come in solid – Nov IP came in +2.2% Y/Y (vs. the St +1.9%), exports +3.9% (vs. the St +0.5%), and imports +3.5% (vs. the St +1.1%). See JPMorgan takeaways: http://bit.ly/2i7MJm7  • German politics – the SPD, Linke, and Green parties in Germany have outlined the conditions by which they would form a coalition. The parties in aggregate have more seats than Merkel’s coalition and thus their alignment could result in a new chancellor for the country. However, the SPD and Linke have in the past differed materially on certain policies (which could complicate any attempt to combine in a coalition). Reuters. http://reut.rs/2jshXJC  • Brexit negotiations – PM May said the UK would make a definitive break w/the EU but wants to negotiate the best possible trade deal w/the bloc – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iTQOfE   • Taiwan – trade numbers for Dec come in strong (exports +14% vs. the St +10.4% and imports +13.2% vs. the St +10%). Bloomberg.  • Trump/cabinet – Trump’s management policy in the WH will represent a sharp break from the Obama era. According to Politico, Trump plans on giving his cabinet secretaries and top aids sig. latitude to run their agencies. Trump also is encouraging his secretaries to “make a splash” within the first six months of his presidency – Politico http://politi.co/2iUOOWE  • Trump/Sessions/immigration – the Washington Post discusses how the Trump team could wind up imposing significant restrictions on the H-1B visa program. Trump and Sessions want to materially overhaul the program and could even scrap it all together. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2i9sCXY  • Corporate tax reform – Larry Summers criticizes the Ryan/Trump corporate tax proposal in a Washington Post editorial; while tax reform is crucial, Summers thinks there is a better way (Summers sees four problems w/the Ryan/Trump blueprint – it increases inequality, harms certain American business sectors, could spark protectionist measures from other countries, and would threaten entitlements by eroding the tax base) – Washington Post http://wapo.st/2i5pv53  • Fiat Chrysler – the co said it would invest an extra $1B in the US, creating 2K new jobs in the process – FT http://on.ft.com/2iSKwie (the WSJ discusses how auto makers are increasingly in the “hot seat” as Trump pressures the industry over production plans http://on.wsj.com/2iYRkLZ).  • Dialog Semi has pre-announced preliminary 4Q16 sales of $365m (+5.6% QoQ, -8% YoY), broadly in line with Bloomberg consensus. The underlying cash generation was modestly higher than our estimate. Company hasn't given any commentary on 1Q17 and FY17 – Udeshi http://bit.ly/2iUyF3x  #Top Headlines from the Weekend  • Trump facing economic headwinds and tax doubts – Politico discusses that while US growth remains decent, trends are quietly slowing and in contrast to Obama in ’09 Trump today is inheriting an economy resting on relatively solid foundations and at/near fullemployment (thus while Obama’s record benefited from easy economic comparisons, Trump’s will suffer from the opposite set of conditions). Meanwhile, further Fed tightening will act as a headwind while investors are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout from the GOP tax reform proposal. Politico. http://politi.co/2j2a0aM  • Growth/inflation risks skewed to the upside – the latest JPMorgan Global Data Watch (from Bruce Kasman) discusses how upside risks are building to the growth and inflation forecasts. The clearest case for a positive GDP growth surprise is in the manufacturing sector. The improvement in manufacturing aligns with better news on global consumption and our global services activity PMI, building the case for stronger global GDP growth. A surge in animal spirits could turn the tide in the direction of sustained stronger growth. Upside risks to inflation complement upside growth risks. The global economy isn’t without obstacles – we are mindful of headwinds to EM growth and remain skeptical that US fiscal policy will turn materially stimulative. http://bit.ly/2irBCVX  • Tax reforms – the NYT looks at the House GOP corporate tax reform plan. Over time the proposal could have virtuous effects on the US economy by encouraging more domestic production and employment while reducing the reliance on debt. However, those benefits would only accrue over the long-term while implementation of the GOP blueprint (which the NYT calls the most revolutionary overhaul in the history of the corporate tax code) could create enormous disruptions almost immediately (harming sectors particularly dependent on imports like retail while strengthening the dollar to such an extent it impacts EMs and others). NYT http://nyti.ms/2jhceCx  • Retailers face multibillion dollar tax hit under GOP plan – the WSJ discusses how the border tax adjustments in the GOP plan threatens to cost the retail industry billions – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k  • Border taxes – the WSJ notes that the border tax proposal has the support of House Republican leadership but Senators and Trump have yet to definitively weigh in on the subject – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k  • Taxes - Larry Kudlow on CNBC (Fri afternoon at ~3:40pmET) says he is ""worried"" that markets are too upbeat around tax reform; tax reform details won't be known until the end of this year at the earliest and Kudlow thinks there is the risk that companies defer economic activity in anticipation of this legislation.  • Healthcare – ACA repeal at risk as four Republicans in the Senate express doubt – the Washington Post notes that four GOP senators have expressed doubt over the ACA repeal strategy which means the party may not have enough votes even for the reconciliation process. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2jmX8zi (the WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2inrRIv, The Hill http://bit.ly/2jeSdfA, and Politico http://politi.co/2jmYudr also highlight rising GOP opposition both in the House and Senate to the ACA repeal-without-replace strategy).  • Healthcare – Republicans grapple w/ACA taxes. The GOP is trying to figure out whether to scrap the ACA taxes during the repeal process or leave them in place. Removing the taxes would add to the deficit and make it harder to pay for a replacement – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2i1B9J0  • Obama thinks ObamaCare will survive – Obama thinks his signature healthcare law will remain intact (although it could get a new name). ""It may be called something else. And as I said, I don't mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn't cooperate because they didn't want to -- make the system work, and relabel it as Trumpcare, I'm fine with that” – ABC http://abcn.ws/2i3b1CH  • Entitlement reform – Trump doesn’t want to “meddle” with Medicare or Social Security according to The Hill. Reince Priebus spoke over the weekend and said Trump intends on honoring his campaign pledge when it comes to entitlements (he won’t pursue entitlement reform). Priebus said Trump plans to “shore up” Medicare and Social Security for future generations by achieving 3-6% economic growth – The Hill http://bit.ly/2iRJCTr  • China Dec FX reserve data (numbers out Sat morning 1/7) – takeaways from JPMorgan’s Grace Ng - China’s FX reserves fell by $41.1 billion in December and registered $3.01 trillion (J.P. Morgan: 3.025 trillion; consensus: $3.01 trillion). This is the lowest level since March 2011, and compared to the peak of $3.993 trillion in June 2014. We estimate that capital outflows in December were around $55 billion. http://bit.ly/2irrqwK  • China – the country’s Vice Finance Minister said he was confident China’s economy grew 6.7% last year. Growth expanded at a 6.7% pace in Q1-3 and Q4 is expected to have been at or above that level – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i2v8AQ  • EU breakup risk – German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned that political support for the EU is at its lowest point ever and a break-up of the union is no longer inconceivable. ""I once asked the chancellor, what would be more costly for Germany: for France to be allowed to have half a percentage point more deficit, or for Marine Le Pen to become president?” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2iRs1sP  • Russia/US – Reince Priebus said Trump accepts the findings of the US intelligence community regarding Russia’s involvement in the US election and the President Elect may take actions in response once he enters office – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jhEc0P  • US/NATO – the US military has vowed to conduct additional training exercises in Europe and bolster NATO further in a bit to deter Russian aggression. ""Let me be clear: This is one part of our efforts to deter Russian aggression, ensure the territorial integrity of our allies and maintain a Europe that is whole, free, prosperous, and at peace” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2iWF26E  • Fund flows – update from JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou - inflows to favor equities in ’17 - Q4 equity funds flows increased to close to $90bn worldwide on our estimates, while bond fund flows decreased to $40bn. Extrapolating these Q4 flows into this year mechanically implies equity fund flows of close to $400bn for 2017 and bond fund flows of less than $200bn. http://bit.ly/2iRoVqz  • Semiconductor M&amp;A – the White House reiterated its desire to protect American semiconductor IP from foreign buyers amid Chinese goals of dominating the industry; restrictions around investments by Chinese entities in the US semi industry are likely to rise– WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iMsxIB  • North Korea – NK on Sun said it could test an ICBM at any time and from any location. ""The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2irDT3D  • North Korea – US Def. Sec threatens to shoot down NK ICBM test - Defense Secretary Ash Carter called NK’s nuclear and missile programs a “serious threat” and threatened to shoot down any North Korean ICBM test ""if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i5zdj2  • Nigeria – the Niger Delta Avengers are preparing to resume attacks against facilities as peace talks w/the gov’t begin to break down – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j22koL  #Macro Update • US macro update - sentiment remains quite effusive looking out over the course of the year although there is nervousness about a near-term digestion pullback (that could coincide w/the inauguration on Fri 1/20). The large gap between political expectations and reality is the single biggest cloud hanging over equities but the problem with allowing that chasm to inform an overly negative view is: 1) growth (the nominal growth improvement predates 11/8 by several months and remains in place) and 2) timing (markets appreciate that any Trump-linked change won’t be immediate and thus appear willing to give him the benefit of the doubt potentially into the end of the summer).  #Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 9 • US speakers – the week of Mon 1/9 has a big lineup of speakers w/Obama’s farewell address on Tues 1/10, Trump’s press conf. on Wed 1/11 (11amET), and a Yellen speech Thurs night 1/12 7pmET). Trump on Wed will be the most important assuming he holds a true Q&amp;A-format press conf. and fields questions from a variety of reporters (he hasn’t done this in several months) – this would help shed light on a variety of topics including ACA repeal/replace, deregulation, tax reform, etc. Yellen’s speech Wed night (7pmET) isn’t likely to be a major catalyst.  • Trump catalysts for the week of 1/9 – a lot of events coming up w/a slew of confirmation hearings and Trump’s press conf. Sessions (AG) confirmation hearing Jan 10-11, Tillerson (State) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Pompeo (CIA) confirmation hearing Jan 11, DeVos (Education) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Kelly (Homeland Sec) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Chao (Transportation) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Ross (Commerce) confirmation hearing Jan 12, Carson (HUD) confirmation hearing Jan 12, and Puzder (Labor) confirmation hearing Jan 12. More confirmation hearings will be added to the calendar (Price at HHS and Mnuchin at Treasury will be important). In terms of market-moving news, the ones to watch are Tillerson, Ross, and Puzder; Carson could be interesting but only for FNMA/FMCC (technically he will be in charge of both companies). These articles provide some more details (Washington Post http://wapo.st/2hYBgKd and Politico http://politi.co/2ikW4rx). In addition to all these hearings, Trump’s press conf. is scheduled for Wed 1/11 at 11amET.  • China economic numbers – Dec CPI/PPI (Tues morning 1/10), Dec imports/exports (Fri morning 1/13), and Dec IP/retail sales/FAI and Q4 GDP (Fri morning 1/20).  • US eco data – the eco calendar is relatively sparse in the US during the week of 1/9 although a few figures on Fri 1/13 will be in focus (Dec PPI, Dec retail sales, and Jan Michigan Confidence).  • Bank earnings – the CQ4 bank earnings season kicks off Fri morning 1/13 (BAC, BLK, FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC will all post results that morning). The Q4 numbers will prob. be somewhat of an afterthought with investors much more focused on mgmt.’s guidance commentary (impact from higher rates, deregulation, etc.). Also, any deleterious effects of higher rates will be watched closely too (including any softening in loan demand, esp. mortgages, credit deterioration, etc.).  #Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be added)   • ICR consumer conf.
