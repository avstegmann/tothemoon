I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.  # **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead. ***** &gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report. ***** &gt; Walmart‚Äôs earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government‚Äôs retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday. ***** &gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank‚Äôs view on inflation. ***** &gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects &gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It‚Äôs going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ***** &gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans. ***** &gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThere is less pushback to President Biden‚Äôs proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,‚Äù noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts. ***** &gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress. ***** &gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels. ***** &gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation. ***** &gt; # Inflation and rising yields In the past week, the 10-year yield ‚Äî a key benchmark ‚Äî touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday. ***** &gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf you think about the big drivers, they‚Äôre related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.‚Äù ***** &gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy. ***** &gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target. ***** &gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we‚Äôll see if that has eased,‚Äù she said. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúObviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,‚Äù said Krosby. ***** &gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January. ***** &gt; # Housing statistics Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week. ***** &gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales. ***** &gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday. ***** &gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934. ***** &gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains. ***** &gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names. ***** &gt; Robinhood‚Äôs CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel. ***** &gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market‚Äôs advance is intact. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúOverall, it‚Äôs a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,‚Äù Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there‚Äôs cyclical leadership. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,‚Äù said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week. ***** &gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/L9zmpOB.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cZgpsNC.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/BvmjknF.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AfQYO3V.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GNiq0fE.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v4lTpw4.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/83YL2qB.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0AZF7RF.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png))**  *****  &gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality  &gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**  &gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day.png))**  *****  &gt; # Trading After Presidents‚Äô Day Weekend Continues to be Weak  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**  &gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents‚Äô Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents‚Äô Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of ‚Äì0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of ‚Äì0.49% and a median loss of ‚Äì0.11%.  &gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents‚Äô Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of ‚Äì0.07% and a median decline of ‚Äì0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average ‚Äì0.02%, median ‚Äì0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average ‚Äì0.01%, median ‚Äì0.09%.  *****  &gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox  &gt; ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù Old Wall Street saying.  &gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs‚Äîit is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!  &gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; ‚ÄúThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.  &gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here‚Äôs hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!  *****  &gt; # Short Interest Update  &gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**  &gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.  &gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**  &gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three‚ÄînCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)‚Äînow have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**  &gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**  &gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Agg-Industry.png))**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QgDa3h7.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE TUESDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/JRy8Aaj.jpg))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 2.15.21 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.

you all don't understand synthetic CDO's please watch this first. Selena Gomez is a babe and you retards will actually learn something for once in your miserable lives.  Now, why should this scare you? Imagine a financial system full of Chads. These Chads got greedy, just like they did before, and let's be real, Chad's don't learn their lessons. These same Chads didn't just short one stonk, i.e GameStop, these factory reject dildos shorted pretty much everything. Refer to the list of stocks with short percents above 60%. That's why it's not just GME that's being squeezed, it's BB, it's NOK, it's FIZZ, it's MAC, it's every single highly shorted stock because these Chads just realized that they have to cover their pasty asses from being completely obliterated.  The thing about these Chads though is they convinced Brett, Cody, Kevin &amp; Pauly, the yacht owning, sperry and plaid short wearing dude bros that their shorts were smart. So what did these upside down Greek Symbols do? They bet on the outcome of the Chads being right.  Taking a short position that was initially a few billion dollars and sending into val-fucking-halla. Am I saying that this will cause the financial system to collapse? Absolutely no because Jerome Powell hallowed be his name will make the money printer go brrrr.

today's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we‚Äôll be going over over the details about what happened this week with GME, the drama around Robinhood and other brokers, and take a close look at some data to determine whether or not GME and other various meme / high SI stocks such as AMC, BBBY, FIZZ, LGND, and ~~BB~~ will continue üöÄüöÄüöÄin its short squeeze this week, and how this all could lead to widespread stock market crash and financial crisis. But first, something to cover my ass for the SEC investigators combing through this Subreddit  Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.  ## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?  There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I‚Äôll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reason given by Robinhood.  [**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)  This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn‚Äôt believe the Sequoia part since I don‚Äôt really know what they would gain from it - they‚Äôre a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I‚Äôd be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop‚Äôs short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I‚Äôll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it‚Äôs actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn‚Äôt happen in the first month in office.  **Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**  This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don‚Äôt know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood‚Äôs sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).  Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There‚Äôs also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn‚Äôt invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.  **The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**  Let‚Äôs get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren‚Äôt able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren‚Äôt able to trade through them. Let‚Äôs dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.  Let‚Äôs talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There‚Äôs a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don‚Äôt want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that‚Äôs where the clearing house comes in. Let‚Äôs call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.  Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller‚Äôs side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.  ## What‚Äôs Robinhood Going To Do About GME?  Robinhood‚Äôs decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here‚Äôs a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood‚Äôs decision, for fun  * [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905) * [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades) * [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html) * [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood‚Äôs office saying ‚ÄúSuck my nuts Robinhood‚Äù * [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/) * [Congressional investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1) * [SEC investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)  Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It‚Äôs especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally ‚Äúdemocratize finance‚Äù, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood‚Äôs image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.  The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we‚Äôve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** üöÄüåù\*\*.\*\*  ## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash  Let‚Äôs go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I‚Äôll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.  &gt;*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*   &gt;   &gt;*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*   &gt;   &gt;*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*   &gt;   &gt;*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*   &gt;   &gt;*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*   &gt;   &gt;*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*   &gt;   &gt;*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*   &gt;   &gt;*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*   &gt;   &gt;*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*   &gt;   &gt;*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*   &gt;   &gt;*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*   &gt;   &gt;*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*   &gt;   &gt;*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*   &gt;   &gt;*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*  [Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)  In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable ‚ÄúNet Exposure‚Äù, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.  A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN‚Äôs stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would‚Äôve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It‚Äôs very likely that if Robinhood hadn‚Äôt stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we‚Äôve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn‚Äôt look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).  **TLDR**  In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,  1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME üöÄüåù 2. Much of the stock market‚Äôs value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) üöÄüåù the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**  *Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it‚Äôs probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it‚Äôll fall below $100.*  Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).  EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=announcement&amp;utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.  EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

This means a decrease in stock price for other institutions aswell. Those institutions need to hedge that risk, but are restricted from buying puts. The only way for them to hedge is by buying stocks with a high short ratio, especially GME. Some of you might have noticed that GME is running the whole highly shorted market by now. Well thats your reason.   Therefore the argument that retail will run out of money or Robinhood will stop the GME run is not true. **What we are witnessing right now is the downfall of the Long/Short Portfolio**. Those shills at CNBC just don¬¥t understand *why* GME is going up. It¬¥s not a bubble and it¬¥s not a mania.   I saw some posts about buying puts on SPY. First of all, that's pretty gay. Second, those smooth-brains don¬¥t understand that **GME is the hedge against a possible downturn**.   Not financial advice.

Stocks move based on supply and demand, so when the majority of the outstanding shares are borrowed and sold short, there is not much supply left to buy.  Then a surge in demand (I.e. everyone starts buying) happens and the stock soars since everyone is bidding on a limited number of shares.  But there is one more element to the puzzle...  FLOAT.  The float is the number of shares available for trading. It represents the total shares outstanding minus restricted shares and those held by long-term investors.  In the same way that a high short interest shrinks the supply, a small float is the same thing.  The rule of thumb is that anything under 15 million shares is considered a small float.  So... what happens when you have a high short interest AND a small float?  The perfect storm for a surge in the share price.  The same domino effect of forced buying to cover shorts adds fuel to the fire of the buying frenzy.  But on top of that, there were even LESS shares to start with.  GME was the most heavily shorted stock out there. Its float was around 29 million shares.  The next 3 most heavily shorted stocks have a short interest of between 62% and 67%.  But one go them, FIZZ (National Beverage Corp), also has a tiny float - just 11 million shares, or roughly a third the size of GME's.  If the mighty force of WSB degenerates decided to target this stock, it could potentially dwarf the move we saw in GME.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4667286.0|public|confidence|self|FIZZ: Short Squeeze + Small Float = MAGIC FORUMLA|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l70ifi/fizz_short_squeeze_small_float_magic_forumla/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||||2021-01-28|FIZZ

Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.‚Äù  **Why It's Important**: Again, it remains to be seen what comes of this, but if the WSB crowd can affect the price of silver, various exchange-traded funds stand to benefit, namely the **iShares Silver Trust** (NYSE:[SLV](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-slv)) and the **Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF** (NYSE:[SIVR](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-sivr)).

This epic rally is quite a thing to behold.  I've been seeing some very erroneous numbers being thrown around and wanted to clear the air.  Melvin is not getting crushed single handedly by this GME squeeze. They are certainly not losing a billion for every $12 that GME goes up. Assuming you see this more as a comedy than a tragedy, it's a lot funnier than that.  As of Melvin's last 13F filing, they are actually short 16 different names, GME being a relatively medium size short (at the time), in dollar terms. Of those 16 names they're short, they are down an astounding 14 of them. Not even kidding. That means they would have a nearly 88% success rate if they just Costanza'd it and did the opposite of what they thought was right.  This is the list, I omitted one name from 13F filing because I couldn't find it's chart on Google, feel free to look for yourselves.  GSX  MLM  LGND  GME  FIZZ  BBBY  ELAN  IRBT  OLLI  IRM  TRN  VIAC  HASI  DDS  SKT  MNKKQ  &amp;#x200B;  I had no idea some of these names were even public, but its definitely hilarious to me than they're being crushed by the likes of Tanger Factory Outlets, iRobot, and fucking Dillard's.  &amp;#x200B;  Full disclosure: I would not recommend buying any of the other names they're short.

FIZZ is only up 4x and 7b market cap, GME is up 100x from earlier.  2. Much strong temptation for insider and at the market offering sales, because GME  is doing badly while FIZZ is doing great. 3. FIZZ is 2nd most shorted stock next to GME by some measures, but EVEN MORE SHORTED by others, especially looking at volume. 4. GME short positions are being recycled from weak hands to rich hands aware of the extreme risk. This process probably is only beginning with FIZZ. 5. Up only 30% today and 15% yesterday, enough to scare shorts and start the squeezing process, but still PLENTY of squeeze left to go. 6. GME has shown the model, but at 25B it just takes a ton more buying to double than FIZZ. 7.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)  There's about 20b of positions here, which matches their NAV prior to all of this. And the positions they picked are for the most part good picks on the long side. This is current as of end of sept. Of course, they don't disclose shorts.  For them to be underwater 30% this quarter means that they were EXTREMELY short in the first place alongside those puts across the portfolio, or that they doubled down hard on a big loser like GME (as an example). In particular, here are their put positions they listed as having end of Sept 2020:  Tanger (up 40% this month, 3.9% today)  Trinity Inds (up 10% this month, 1.28% today)  Viacom (up 25% this month, 5% toda)  Ollies Bargain Outlets  (up about 10%, 2% today)  National Beverage (up 20% ytd, 11% today)  Mylan (down 5% ytd, down 1.35% today)  Martin Marietta (up 10% ytd, down 1% today)   Mallinckrodt Pub Ltd (had trouble getting, excluding, I think it's bankrupt so let's call this a -100%)  Ligand Pharma (up 50% ytd, 10% today)  Iron Mtn (up 2% ytd, 6% today)  Irobot (up 25% YTD, 16.9% today)  Hannon  Armstromg (up 3% ytd, down 1% today)  GSX Techedu (duh) (up 60% ytd, 9% today. This is a very sketchy stock, I'm surprised they are trying it)  Elanco Animal Health (Down a few % ytd, down 2% today)  Dillards (up 35% ytd,  up 7% today)  Bed Bath and Beyond (up 50% ytd, Up 5% today)  and of course..  Gamestop (up \~400% ytd, up 12% as of this writing)  That's an average of  38%. That suggests with the tweet that they were running a complete long/short market neutral into a bull market, and happened to pick extreme losers on the short side.   What I find really remarkable about this is they didn't risk manage on the way up - this suggests they either were doubling down on some, or just were not risk managing at all - since their bull picks should be up on average.   Previously, we only KNEW they were short with puts, that expired jan 15th. But it apperas they pair their puts with naked shorts, since those numbers kind of match up.  **Crazy theory: Most of their shorts are way up today. I know a lot of people are bidding Most-shorted-names, but I wonder if this citadel deal comes wit ""Get the hell out of all shorts now"", and this is them making a hasty exit. Some of these aren't moving - perhaps they already exited them. Most of these positions are moving up a lot today. A bit suspicious. I wonder if they bought in to GME at $140 today?**  *Disclaimer: I'm actively trading GME. Currently short at this price level after the collapse this AM with drastic OOM puts in case we get gamma unwind. I'm actively trading BBBY, mostly on the long side.*"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2177082.0|public|confidence|self|Melvin Losses Discussion and Analysis|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wmkl/melvin_losses_discussion_and_analysis/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'uFHlePAmb_JvhSvYa2--OtbvpWWv4YvT-SvRJlnrQbQ', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_fWCxqvWmWNMQpv4qVtakjLV5drScJ9-cT4T8DRCTkE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b8cece0b3ee2e0594e10af0a0072fece7320404', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 140, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_fWCxqvWmWNMQpv4qVtakjLV5drScJ9-cT4T8DRCTkE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d7e93eb95327c636881a022d2bf94a98e672f1c6', 'width': 140}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||2021-01-25|FIZZ

I'm not aware of any catalyst ie. no Ryan Cohen, will need to rely on retard strength alone. Squeeze Rating: Medium/High  DDS - With a $1.8B market cap and trading close to $80, this is a department store.

Not only did we prove that our Asperger army can move mountains and topple empires, but more importantly we realized the true collective power of this sub when we all get behind a play and hammer it home. Endless potential.   I‚Äôm riding the GME lightning to the tune of 1,000 shares, and will add calls on the open,   It's time for us to tee up the next massive fuck you to the shorts, and DDS is looking sexy.  To lead off, latest rumor has it that Melvin Capital not only bag holding a large short position in GME, but also DDS and BBBY. I caught wind of this via Harry Kupperson, the CIO of Pratoriean Capital - aka one of the OG‚Äôs of event driven trading - aka one of us. For validation, take a look at his twitter feed and his grade A trolling of Melvin Capital.   When you take a look at the price movement for DDS and line it up with GME over the last month or so this makes sense. When GME pumps, DDS pumps. So we have a potential scenario here where the unwinding of shorts in GME could result in near identical moves in not only DDS but also BBBY. Essentially our one sided bet on GME could turn into a parlay with some pretty fucking favorable odds for the boys.  DDS takes the number two spot for heaviest short interest with a whopping 92% of the float short, yet since Jan. 12th she's run from $55/share right up to $79.80 at Friday's close, but the move back up to ATH ($130) and beyond is in the early innings.  Short interest isn't the only thing we have working in our favor here, but also buybacks. Over the past two quarters, execs have bought back 5% of outstanding shares for $132mm, or roughly 9% of the Mkt cap.  This puts the insider ownership at 26% of outstanding shares. From a competitive landscape Dillards appears to be in a strong position, benefitting from significant store closures of competitors, such as Macys, as well as posting strong sales numbers for this past quarter.  Last but not least, fundamentals are solid af. I won‚Äôt dive into them here, but if you‚Äôre not sold at this point then by all means.   I played this one week before last and hopped out on a quick +100% gain, and I'm currently sitting on some calls that are up over 200%, but I'm planning on entering into some more 2/19 $90 calls at the open along with some BBBY calls.

I did some more DD, and am aggregating it here. $FIZZ is the LaCroix sparkling water company, with plenty of other lesser known brands  -short interest of 7.3M shares on a float of 8.8M shares (83%, which is the second highest to $GME among all stocks, as far as I can tell) -given average volume around 300,000/day, it would take shorts 27 trading days to cover (this is the highest I‚Äôve found, about 5 times what it was for GME before the squeeze [fizz short interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fizz/short-interest) -1 person (founder and CEO) owns over 33M shares, and he‚Äôs an old Italian guy who hates short sellers (so he‚Äôll never sell, which is the definition ofüíéüôå) -late last year they announced a $6/share dividend which is payable in February (remember, shorts have to pay the dividend for any borrowed share because the company only pays the didvidend once per share, while a short share is borrowed and sold, meaning 2 people ‚Äúown‚Äù the same 1 share.) -recent uptrend in price and volume coincides with the epic $GME squeeze, likely indicating an attempt  by shorts to begin covering. But the total volume of &lt;1.8M the last 3 days wouldn‚Äôt even put a dent in the short interest, and we all know that only a fraction of that was shorts covering. -Company still has over $100M in cash and is hugely profitable      ‚Ä¢33% ROE      ‚Ä¢20% operating margin      ‚Ä¢&gt;$200M operating cash flow      ‚Ä¢44% earnings growth [fizz financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIZZ/key-statistics?p=FIZZ) ‚Ä¢CEO will get $200M CASH from the dividend. I could see him buying another million shares to lock away, further reducing the float and making short covering even harder   So a profitable, growing business with an old Italian CEO who is angry at short sellers, paying huge dividends, and a potentially even further reduced float. Think about shorts trying to buy back 7M shares from üíéüôå WSB traders when the days to cover ratio is 27.  Even $GME was ‚Äúonly‚Äù about 5-6 (which is a very big number!)  As an added bonus, some chart guys can add to this, but the 3 month MACD Golden cross happened Friday, it is now above 20 and 50 day averages, and probably some other stuff I don‚Äôt understand.  üòÇ  I think $GME was the king due to the short interest being higher than the float, but this isn‚Äôt far behind, especially given its ability to move large amounts on low volume. The stock is up about 20% the last 3 days on almost no ‚Äúextra‚Äù volume, and given the volume increase the shorts would need to create to cover shares while fighting retail and institutions who see this coming too, this could definitely double, triple, quadruple, who knows. That‚Äôs a lot of shares the shorts need to pry from people. And being honest, current holders of stocks like this may not even be the kinds of people that check their portfolio religiously, so you may even see market makers having to sell shares they don‚Äôt have to keep an orderly market since there‚Äôs not enough liquidity to cover that many short shares, which just adds fuel to the fire. Plus, the dividend and threat of another special dividend has to scare the crap out of them as a double whammy of buying back at a big loss and then paying out CASH to the people you sold to.  I definitely look forward to the smell of burning shorts on this one.

In this post I'll explore why BBBY is worth your attention, and shed light on another company by the ticker of FIZZ which some people think should follow a similar track to BBBY soon.  **BBBY, what do we know?**  &gt; Digital sales soared 77% from a year ago, fueled by online growth of 94% at Bed Bath‚Äôs namesake banner.  The company has great finanicals as covered by this post: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxn8it/the_bbby_short_squeeze_little_sister_of_all_short/  However the post failed to explore BBBY's ace of spades: the new management which came just before the Corona. Imagine what a great timing, the new CEO Mark Tritton didn't have time to learn the ""old ways"" of the company and grow complacent and fat unlike CEOs which have been 20 years in other retailers. They're old news, they can't innovate, they're stuck thinking like a dinosaur, you can't change a person's thinking after all he's known for 20 years is the company's brick and mortar old ways. In contrast, Mark Tritton was thrown into the fray right into Coronavirus crisis, into this new way of thinking of how to maintain business in this brave new world.  Our boy Cramer interviewed Mark and you should hear what he has to say about his business: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfYF1M7A4ys  Mark is leading an overhaul of the company, and we're already seeing the fruits bearing from his moves.  *What about FIZZ?* This is in fact a dinosaur company, there's been no interviews with the CEO and I couldn't find one mention of the Coronavirus in their quarterlies. Still, the company is expected to weather out this crisis, and their net assets have been growing in this period so they'll manage. Make no mistake however, their CEO is #299 in Forbes richest people (having been higher in the past), you don't get there by chance. This is a good stock for the playing the Coronavirus ending, and could be used as a hedge so you don't get fucked by Techs falling as we saw earlier with the vaccine announcements. But honestly, this is more interesting because of the short squeeze potential.  **So what unites these two companies? ** 1. [High short interest!](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) FIZZ is ranked #5 while BBBY #6. Of course our king GME is #1, that's the real show. 2. Melvin Capital PUTs! You can see it here: https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp  You can count on Melvin to exploit the Coronavirus to have people fired and investors lose money during this crisis. BBBY is already edging towards a short squeeze (GME and SPWR is already hurting their puts).  I would advise people to go hard on BBBY, it's a great turnaround story, and buy some spare calls on FIZZ - it has low IV. Both these stocks will be fueled by short interest, so expect volatility and if they go high enough, a proper short squeeze.  **TLDR** positions: **BBBY 2/19 $42c + stocks** **FIZZ 2/19 $90-100c (low IV!)** **GME 2/19 $42c**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1848972.0|public|confidence|self|BBBY &amp; FIZZ - Hurting Melvin with Fundamentals|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxsbtr/bbby_fizz_hurting_melvin_with_fundamentals/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'iZTy4RC5UuQ60BQ8_IebKy3s4iUAwkna3T8ZWoy4NxM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vH82TI4sq7u1mEe6oC3BYlGYz_k2aa0wNifge2bBhkw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5afd6f66885b96c75e187eeb99ff992c277af01', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vH82TI4sq7u1mEe6oC3BYlGYz_k2aa0wNifge2bBhkw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aaf3a17d20af97b8f5edf6b751b8873c45a5753', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vH82TI4sq7u1mEe6oC3BYlGYz_k2aa0wNifge2bBhkw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61736d691f1cd054d1e27e0d0bded381f0dba39f', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vH82TI4sq7u1mEe6oC3BYlGYz_k2aa0wNifge2bBhkw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e52f4266cb16889515c4ff14e5f9893c23e1566d', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||2021-01-15|FIZZ

See screen grabs below from Marketbeat.com. (I had to update FIZZ with data from Nasdaq.com because marketbeat.com was outdated.) It will take the shorts 24 days to cover their shorts on average volume vs just 6 on GME.   Like GME, FIZZ is a small cap at just $3.8bn. It's prime short squeeze material. It's up 127% from the lows in March, up 5% yesterday and another 2% today so far. I don't know how much more the shorts can take.    GME rallied 70% yesterday on a short squeeze. FIZZ can do much more. There is a critical build-up of snow on the mountain and the avalanche could trigger at any moment.  If you're short - be warned. If you're long good luck. If you're on the side lines - you know what to do.

The S&amp;P 500 set an intraday record high but declined 0.2% amid relative weakness in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.0%. * There was an absence of new macro developments, so the same tech-related stocks continued to set the winning pace at the expense of the cyclical stocks within the energy (-2.2%), materials (-1.5%), financials (-1.2%), and industrials (-1.2%) sectors. Declining issues outpaced advancing issues by more than a 2:1 margin at the NYSE.  * Apple (AAPL 129.04, +4.23, +3.4%) and Tesla (TSLA 498.32, +55.64, +12.6%) rose 3% and 12%, respectively, as investors continued to bid shares higher following their stock splits today. Amazon (AMZN 3450.96, +49.16, +1.5%) gained 1.5% after its drone delivery unit received FAA certification. * AAPL and AMZN carried the S&amp;P 500 information technology (+0.4%) and consumer discretionary (+0.2%) sectors into the green, but the health care (+0.3%) and utilities (+0.3%) sectors also put in a positive performance. * Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index climbed 15.0% to 26.41, as investors assumed some protection against a possible downturn in equities. The popular view is that a modest correction could come in September after a strong two-month performance in the S&amp;P 500. The benchmark index ended August with an impressive 7.0% gain.  * Separately, CNBC reported that a TikTok deal could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Front-runners Microsoft (MSFT 225.53, -3.38, -1.5%), Walmart (WMT 138.85, -1.45, -1.0%), and Oracle (ORCL 57.22, -0.66, -1.1%) declined at least 1.0% today.  * U.S. Treasuries saw modest gains amid the underlying weakness in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined four basis points to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 92.19. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.35, to $42.62/bbl. * Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for August and Construction Spending for July on Tuesday.  ## Index Summary  **S&amp;P 500 :** (-0.36%);**NasDaq :** (+0.86%);   **Russell 2000 :**(-1.08%);**Dow :**(-0.84%);   **Vix :**26.41 3.45 (+15.03%)  ## Sector Summary -  *Three highest sectors for today were :*   Information Technology(+0.32%); Utilities(+0.3%); Health Care(+0.24%)   *Three lowest sectors for today were :*   Energy(-2.17%); Materials(-1.53%); Industrials(-1.24%)     ## Commodities/Futures  (1-day %), \[5-day %\], {10-day %}  *Currency -*   USDIndex : 92.379(-0.17%); \[-0.85%\]; {-0.6%}; {-0.6%}; BC : 11630(+1.68%); \[+4.55%\]; {-0.59%}  *Precious Metals -*   Gold : 1974.9(+0.06%); \[+3.36%\]; {+2.18%}; Silver : 27.79(+1.69%); \[+7.66%\]; {+4.2%}  *Farming -*   *Soybeans : 950.5 (+1.63%); \[+5.06%\]; {+6.98%}; Corn : 359.25(+1.39%); \[+2.68%\]; {+7.37%};*   *Coffee : 126.35(+1.54%); \[+4.48%\]; {+8.22%}*  *Industrials -*   Crude : 42.97(+1.16%); \[+0.28%\]; {+2.09%}    Copper : 3.0195(+1.14%); \[+4.2%\]; {+2.83%}; Nat Gas : 2.657(-1.51%); \[+5.14%\]; {+11.27%}  ## Options Fast Facts  *CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.42*   *Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -* AIMT with 1390x the ADV of 77746.
