The clinical trials was event driven meaning they needed 298 deaths, as prefaced by the FDA, to have a conclusive data set to determine whether the drug works or not. The trial went on for nine years since 2011 and finally reached its 298th event in April of 2020. Phase 2 had great results showing 33% improvement in overall survivability, and in some cases reduction in the tumor! Safe to say I am pretty stoked about Phase 3 results. Since the last event CVM has been compiling and verifying data, and they recently announced Data Lock in December. This means that they verified and ""locked"" the data, and it is ready for the final step -- Data Analysis. This final step typically takes 2-3 months before the data is released. I have a really good feeling about this! There has not been a development in Head&amp;Neck cancer in 50 years. If the data shows improvement of 10% over SOC (standard of care), then the stock will absolutely moon! Think about it, if proven successful this drug could be the NEW standard of care. CVM is currently valued at 570M and with a buy-out it could be easily worth 3-5 billion. That is 500-900% we're talking here! However, if the drug is a bust, then you should expect to see this stock tank to $1. There is a huge risk to this play, but the potential payout is just too good to ignore. I am willing to lose $10,000 with the potential to gain $100,000! Below is a photo of the CEO, Geert Kersten, who has been relentlessly calling out lying shorts on Twitter. He has a lot of stocks that he hasn't sold since 2000, so I believe with his confidence and investment that this drug is in fact a winner.

It's main product (and the one it will live or die by) is Multikine, an injection meant to treat newly diagnosed advanced head and neck cancer with the goal of extending their life.  In layman's terms Multikine is a combination of small proteins that signal an immune system response. It's goal is to boost the body's immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells before the immune system is degraded by chemotherapy and radiation.  The event-driven Phase 3 study was fully enrolled with 928 patients, and the last patient was treated in September 2016. As of May 4, 2020 the company has announced that the final event (death) needed to perform final analysis has occurred meaning we should expect results to be announced within the next 2 months (End of July at the latest imo).   &amp;#x200B;  # Why Indicators Point To Success   &amp;#x200B;  * Trial has gone on significantly longer than expected (why does this matter? It means people are dying less than predicted which is a good thing! (can be from a number of reasons, the most likely being that Multikine is doing what this Phase 3 trial is set to look for - extending patient's lives)  &amp;#x200B;  * IDMC (independent data monitoring committee) responsible for reviewing study data for safety and efficacy reviewed unblinded data on April 23 and gave go ahead to allow trial to proceed.     * Typically, IDMC would stop trials for futility if drugs really didn’t work (seen as recently as March 2020 with the [javelin-head-and-neck-100-trial](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/javelin-head-and-neck-100-trial-discontinued-due-to-efficacy-doubts) where the trial was stopped for efficacy doubts, and Multikine's trial has gone on for 9 years)  &amp;#x200B;  * Their CRO, Ergomed (company in charge of running the trial) has put a large stake in this trial succeeding.   &amp;#x200B;  * The CEO's net worth is tied up in CVM stock and stock options that would expire worthless if the trial fails (and stock goes to sub 1 dollar subsequently) aka hes putting his money where his mouth is  &amp;#x200B;  # Why this shit could bomb   We know Multikine is doing something since just as recently as a month ago the IDMC allowed the trial to continue with seemingly almost all the data, but we don't know if it will be statistically significant (for example the control arm could be living longer for whatever reason, both experimental and control arms could be living longer for whatever reason, dropout rate could be high and alter results). All of these are unlikely but not completely zero.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **ELI5**: Almost 9 year Phase 3 clinical trial ended Monday and we are now anticipating data readout. Reading the tea leaves appear to suggest the trial will be successful, and if so potential payout could be huge ( \~460M to 4B-6B market-cap depending on how you value it, 7-10x gain). Waiting for buyout could be even bigger (10-12B)  &amp;#x200B;  Proof of position:  [https://imgur.com/a/K65y5vz](https://imgur.com/a/K65y5vz)   [https://imgur.com/a/kY7hwqj](https://imgur.com/a/kY7hwqj)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1175840|public|confidence|self|Cel-Sci (NYSEMKT:CVM) - Phase 3 Clinical Trial YOLO|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gez3ra/celsci_nysemktcvm_phase_3_clinical_trial_yolo/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'wOYSBc9w4xJMiaM4JjeRcF6xqF_j71uYo9s6GbcEINY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e377f292f0e5ed59b644a1d7b611ae31c0ed2a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 432, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77ab4f1605b0dbce6eb733cda0fa036ffcabe8a7', 'width': 216}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52c02a11d893d2c2e0700f0dd09a5d41c2836750', 'width': 320}, {'height': 1280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064482c4316a878477df28f694577a0a5a30895f', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1920, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cacbd2b52a91823a7981575c5d3ab1d041422858', 'width': 960}, {'height': 2160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aae6f1d1fc13fc14a65bcaf109515f2e050e83b2', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2436, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h2SmtaYzyzZF5dUv9F4XbS8Q2bnMAKlNdv4hKquqQwk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=98a792ba82b22e2ae3771ecee1e0d7043ec76edd', 'width': 1125}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||2020-05-07|CVM

The Dow is currently on track to post a losing week, its second in four weeks, while the Nasdaq is likely to rise for the seventh week in a row after a record close Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 is just below breakeven for the week, and would post its eighth weekly gain in since weeks if it can erase that deficit. (CNBC) American Express (AXP), a Dow component, releases earnings before today’s opening bell. No major earnings reports are scheduled after today’s closing bell, and no economic reports out today. (CNBC) * Dow stock Intel (INTC) was rising 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and revenue after the bell Thursday. Results were helped by improvement in personal computer and data center demand, and Intel also gave an upbeat current quarter outlook as well as announcing a 5% dividend increase. (CNBC) * A large broadcast satellite, owned by AT&amp;T’s (T) DirecTV, built by Boeing (BA) and operated by Intelsat (I), suffered major damage to its batteries in December and is now at risk of exploding.

China has extended its travel ban to 13 cities, covering 35 million people. (CNBC &amp; NY Times) * CDC: Level 3 health warning for coronavirus; State Department: Level 2 travel advisory (CNBC) * China to build 1000-bed hospital over weekend (Reuters) * Social controls, SARS experience help China close off cities (AP) * Walt Disney’s (DIS) Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice to help China stop the spread of the flu-like virus, costing the theme park operator revenue during the country’s biggest holiday season. China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, a period when the Shanghai Disney park would be usually packed with tourists. (Reuters) * The World Economic Forum is wrapping up today in Davos, Switzerland. A Hong Kong property developer said the U.S. chose the wrong decade to start a trade conflict with China. “They should have picked the war 10 years ago,” said David Chiu, chairman of Far East Consortium International. (CNBC) * George Soros rips Trump and Xi, says the ‘fate of the world’ is at stake in 2020 (CNBC) * Soros says Xi is the ‘most dangerous’ opponent of those who believe in open society (CNBC) * Soros warns Trump of potential economic doom before election (CNBC) * Soros says Elizabeth Warren ’is the most qualified to be president’ (CNBC) * Democrats will press their final day of arguments today before skeptical Republican senators at President Trump’s impeachment trail, focusing on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress’ investigation. House prosecutors made an expansive case yesterday that he abused power like no other president in history, swept up by a “completely bogus” Ukraine theory pushed by attorney Rudy Giuliani. (AP) * Former VP Joe Biden leads other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, while several others appeared to be gaining momentum in their bid for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll. The online poll showed that 24% of registered Democrats and independents supported Biden, while 20% backed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and 12% said they would vote for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. * The Trump administration is set to release a report today that outlines its short-term and long-term plans for enlisting e-commerce companies to combat counterfeit products on their platforms. The Wall Street Journal reported that law enforcement will begin identifying cases immediately and “seek all available statutory authorities to pursue civil fines and other penalties against these entities.” * J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon got a 1.6% raise to $31.5 million for his work in 2019 after his bank posted record earnings and shares of the company surged. Dimon’s compensation package includes $1.5 million in salary and $30 million in performance-based incentives. (CNBC) * The U.S. government announced that former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has been banned from ever working at a bank again and will pay $17.5 million for scandals in which millions of fake accounts were set up to meet sales quotas. Regulators plans to target other individuals, including former executives, for their role in the scandals. (CNBC) * Home DNA-testing company 23andMe is laying off about 100 people, or 14% of its staff, on Thursday, in the wake of declining sales. The company plans to tighten its focus on the * DTC business and its therapeutics arm while scaling back its clinical studies arm. Additionally, TripAdvisor is planning to cut 200 jobs, or 5% of its total workforce. (CNBC) * Jim Lehrer, co-host and later host of the nightly PBS “NewsHour” that for decades offered a thoughtful take on current events, has died. He was 85. Lehrer died “peacefully in his sleep,” according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983 and more recently, had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008.

The stock has been pumped a lot recently due to a lot of seeking alpha articles (which are written by the friends of the CEO btw). However, I noticed that there’s an insane short position on this stock (22000 open interest for january puts). If cvm’s phase 3 tanks (and there is a large chance that it will due to over 300 patient deaths), this stock will hit 0.   Now, I also bought a 15 dollar call just in case their phase 3 absolutely rocks.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares.
