Hence, whoever owns the book deed, owns all rights including renting, borrowing funds, using them as collateral. We are only on the Broker internal pc and has insurance covering the number of Shares. But DRS is registering the Shares electronically on the Book deed under your name. This is Free. If enough of us transfer even a portion 50% into DRS then say the broker must register for us the legitimate shares. Then forces the dealer any remaining DRS shares requested to seek it from Shorts and forces the Squeeze. But DRS separate the shares as for us the broker must register the legitimate shares.**    **For example with TDAmeritrade, I filled this:**[**tdameritrade.com/retail-en\_...**](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA100557.pdf) **then attached it internally under my account to TD stating transfer number of shares (Stock Symbol) to ""AST"" American Security Transfer. There is also PST (Philadelphia Stock Transfer) here is the link:** [**us.astfinancial.com/Content...**](https://us.astfinancial.com/Content/articles/15537_50.pdf?7/3/20115) **Since it is a new account when I filled the TDAmeritrade under Transfer account Number I put ""AST"" then transferred out and I got a letter of my account No from PST (so later I use the number to transfer back and forth by using the DRS application and submit to TDAmeritrade. The SEC explanation about it is here:** [**sec.gov/reportspubs/investo...**](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html) **but since we are under relentless Short Attack, the most advantage of this is forcing the broker to transfer and protect the legitimate Shares first and keep the naked shares at the broker.**    **Large brokers can do the DRS. email your broker and ask them. Because DRS needs to initiate whether you transfer the shares into your name or back into street name to sell them when you need to. It is for free with the companies I listed above. If your broker does not do DRS or refuse to do it to discourage you like Robinhood does not. So I opened a free account with a broker than does first like TDAmeritrade. Then from TDAmeritrade, I used the Transfer fund feature and select from another broker and then follow Robinhood instruction:** [**robinhood.com/us/en/support...**](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/) **This stage Robinhood charged 75.**    **For example with TDAmeritrade, I filled this:** [**https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en\_us/resources/pdf/TDA100557.pdf**](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA100557.pdf)  Then attached it internally under my account to TD stating transfer number of shares SRNE to ""AST"" American Security Transfer.

The SEC explanation about it is here:  [https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html)  So, from the time I filled the DRS and transferred out was 4 days. Then took 3 days to receive a letter by mail with my new account. Then to transfer back, I filled same DRS and stated to transfer back the shares and also scanned and attached the letter with my shares. It took about 3 days to see my shares back into my TDAmeritrade account. So the disadvantage one  can find is the few days needed to get the shares back into the account with the broker to be able to sell them."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9513678.0|public|confidence|self|Shares in Street Name VS Your name on the Book like who owns the property Deeds controls lending out or not|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3ak0r/shares_in_street_name_vs_your_name_on_the_book/|some_ads|7.0|||||||||||||||2021-03-12|SRNE

things first, I'm not a Melvin or Citadel bot trying to divert your attention from the squeeze play. I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)  Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).  I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.  Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.  Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.  After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.  [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)  In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday.   Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.  TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.  This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I’m excited about, and I’d love some feedback.

I’m an IVY league trained physician (yes you can trust me scientifically and medically), I’ve been reading about SRNE since March 2020 and this will truly help COVID and covid will be around for many many years unfortunately but SRNE has so many angles to help. We need WSB help to help society and our pockets.   SRNE is a play like MRNA, NVAX, GILD, CODX all in one package.

If you don’t want long shit skip to positions and TLDR. If you want me to search a ticker, you can comment it or PM me and I’ll try my best to get to it and we can talk shop. * ________________  Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I’d share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea.   *REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*  **The way I’ll break this down is by laying out my..**  **C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula.   **B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks.   **A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.    **C choices some whales bought:**  **FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar** [UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg) **FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%) **SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22 **Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES  **Earnings Reports**: Mid February  **Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.  **Why I don’t like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but  **IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you’re giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources.   **Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.  **B choices**:  [**PEP** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg) **Unusual Whales**: No alert **Earnings Report**: February 11th  **Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.    **[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I’ll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he’s switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.  **Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.  **FB**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg) **Unusual Whale alert**: No **Earnings Report**: 1/27  **Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They’ve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought.   **IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.  **Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c  **DVN**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies)  [DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg) **Unusual Whales alert**: Yes **Earnings Report:** Feb 16th  **Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.  **IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news  **Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.  **A list:** [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%)   **Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too.   **IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).  **Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing.   &gt;While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it’s hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment—or lack any treatment at all—then the stocks will fly.   **Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.  **Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I’m trying to connect some dots on:**  [1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg) I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend... [2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg) I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.  I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines.   **Open Interest change notables**: 1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc). 2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10 3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes 4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys  —————————-  **Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5  **Positions:** **PEP** 145c 2/12 **FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c **DVN** 2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **EDIT**: 2/5 77c **INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge) **VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans.   *waiting for a dip for some of these because I’m Nervous about Thursday.*   **TLDR**: Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.  ——————  *This doesn’t update so I’ll put screenshots and stuff if more interesting stuf comes in when I check in the daily thread.

Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn’t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that’s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:  [https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)  Essentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem.   Needless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th 😌)  [https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)  Then in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn’t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.  **The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE’s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.  News on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.  Regardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.  SRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.  If you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.  *""I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,"" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*  [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)  (Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)  Even after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.  [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)  I'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+  As always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.  **Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.  **TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = 🚀. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.

Meanwhile, profit taking may also be playing a role following the tech-led gains on Monday and Tuesday of this week.  **ECONOMIC EVENTS:** In the U.S., initial jobless claims fell 33,000 to 860,000 in the week ended September 12. Housing starts dipped 5.1% to a 1.416M pace in August. The Philly Fed index fell 2.2 points to 15.0 in September, which was weaker than expected.  **TOP NEWS:** Reports flooded in about ByteDance's proposed agreement with Oracle (ORCL) over TikTok, with [CNBC reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/trump-to-rule-on-tiktok-deal-in-24-36-hours-oracle-to-take-20percent-stake.html) that President Donald Trump is expected to rule on the agreement in the next 24-36 hours. CNBC's David Faber noted in his reporting that under the proposed deal, Oracle will own roughly 20% of the new entity and Walmart (WMT) will be involved in some capacity. Meanwhile, Bloomberg said that the U.S. Treasury Department sent ByteDance a revised terms sheet late yesterday and the company and Oracle have accepted it. The changes address national security concerns about the deal, according to Bloomberg.  Shares of AstraZeneca (AZN) were in focus after [CNN said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-trial-document/index.html) that an internal safety report by the company sheds light on the neurological condition suffered by one of the participants in its coronavirus vaccine clinical trial, detailing how the 37-year-old study volunteer ""experienced confirmed transverse myelitis"" after receiving her second dose of the vaccine, and was hospitalized on September 5."" In response, AstraZeneca [disputed the report](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1306594370855088128), saying it contains ""inaccuracies,"" including hte diagnosis, which is based on preliminary findings. The company added that the information shared by CNN ""was not obtained from internal documents, but rather sent to investigators and doctors running trials that should not be shared because they contain confidential patient records.""      Meanwhile, Moderna (MRNA) shares were 4% lower near 1 pm ET after CEO Stephan bancel said that the company anticipates a base plan for efficacy for the first interim readout of its coronavirus vaccine data to be in November and the best case scenario plan being in October. He also said October is unlikely, but it is possible and that the worst case scenario would be in December.  **MAJOR MOVERS:** Among the noteworthy gainers was Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE), which surged 11% after it received FDA clearance to proceed with its STI-1499 trial. Also higher was Herman Miller (MLHR), which gained 34% after reporting quarterly results.  Among the notable losers was Dave &amp; Buster's (PLAY), which fell 25% after a Wall Street Journal [report ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dave-busters-warns-of-bankruptcy-if-no-lender-deal-struck-11600292027)that the company has warned of bankruptcy potential. Also lower was Nano-X Imaging (NNOX), which declined 18% after Empire Financial Research's Whitney Tilson [said ](https://empirefinancialresearch.com/articles/nnox-is-theranos-2-0-short-report-on-lumber-liquidators-interviews-with-carson-block-and-dan-david-snowflakes-ipo-working-remotely-from-bermuda)that Citron's Andrew Left is right about Nano-X, as its ""stock is worthless.""   **INDEXES:** Near 1 pm ET, the Dow was down 211.02, or 0.75%, to 27,821.36, the Nasdaq was down 213.57, or 1.93%, to 10,836.90, and the S&amp;P 500 was down 42.69, or 1.26%, to 3,342.80."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1501633.0|public|confidence|self|Autistic Top Stories at midday Sept 17|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iunwy4/autistic_top_stories_at_midday_sept_17/|no_ads|0.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'j0VG1ETzCPSqu4LsO5vNTSoAZyK443OGJD9-dMCuefM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea8f54e9fb631b92459b0e4d336ebed257642dc0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e412bda99beb9862296dba55c0318b20bb80ac', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a4103dcf8de7b195ddded053532d6f71881f904', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08e46bfc418d0b621b63f02a8c39eee8632c68a4', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6256748b39e9d4affc0b62045356f8a834bfce45', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7893ea2d4b84428f364e2a2fae9637bc45ff10c4', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 3409, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/nxu8m4j2Vg9x5MyG13G1k3LGJ0xXoQZmrwUS9bDy5T4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2af08dd23c89209a98b705070b96bf290feb79b1', 'width': 5112}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||2020-09-17|SRNE

It's just gotten 2nd phase approval for a covid therapy drug in those who have moderate to severe cases, but is also working on a drug/treatment cocktail protein blocker. There was a lot of doubt for them a while back on here being a pump n dump, and something about a 1b buyout at 7$ which was declined by the company. Now they are at $8+ and are still looking promising. I'd be making the gamble that they could have a better performing drug, better manufacturing ability and wider range of products for covid but its been nothing but good news so far. Bad idea?

It's nearly impossible to catch them before they get the terror run up.   Therefore there is literally no way I can time an entry into one of these or predict which vaccine will be successful. BUT...  I am noticing a trend that after some major movers get their short term insane bumps, there is an inevitable dump after everyone has been rushes in on the FOMO.  My thought is ill never catch the run up, but I can catch the short play or the put option play on the way down.  A few examples, among many are ...   **$DVAX**, May 19th run up $6.51 May 27 dump to $4.75  **$SRNE**, May 18th $8.82, June 1 slow dump to $4.98  **$HARP**, May 29th run up $21.99, June 1 slow dump $18.28  The list goes on and on, just watch the top movers on a daily basis and you'll spot one this week. The Gap/trend seems evident.    I tried this strategy on some non-virus stocks **$ACB** and **$TGI** with small wins - but looking for feedback or ideas regarding this trading strategy.  Doing quick DD helped me narrow down the ""fake"" winners.  I do not own the rights to this site and am not affiliated in anyway, but found this to also be a very effective and valuable resource when thinking about entry/exit timing: [https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov\_vaccine\_landscape/](https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_vaccine_landscape/)  TL;DR  Short major movers that get anomalous spikes for no apparent reason or on the fake news, see examples above.

There seems to be a lot of excitement made by these claims.  I am not.  Here is why.    **How did they do it**? **(and my response)**  Fox News Article: *""We want to emphasize there is a cure. There is a solution that works 100 percent,""*     Sorrento Website: *""* *These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31, 2020.""  ""STI-1499, demonstrated 100% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro virus infection experiment at a very low antibody concentration*. ""  From a clinical standpoint, it is misleading to suggest that there is a solution that works ""100 percent"".  These tests were done **in vitro**, that is to say, they were done by in cells.  This was not done in animals such as mice, and this was not tested in humans.  They claim that this was done at a ""low antibody concentration"".  The idea being suggested is that you don't need a lot of it to stop the virus from entering cells (given what it is targeting).    Strictly speaking, I have no idea what ""low antibody concentration"" means.  I have absolutely zero comparison or reference.  Does ""low"" mean ""low"" compared to the other not so great antibodies they tested?  Importantly, not addressed here is the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 being used for these experiments and how that compares to the concentrations used for other drugs in the same experiments.  In short, a lot of compounds might seem more effective and do a better job of ""inhibiting"" the virus, if there's a lot less virus around to be dealing with.  I would be far more impressed if it was stated that this was demonstrated to be effective despite increasing concentrations of virus etc.    **Judgement:**    *""We want to emphasize there is a cure. There is a solution that works 100 percent,""*     My counterpoint ""A solution that works 100% under what circumstances?"".    **How did they sell it?**  Fox News:   *Dr. Ji pointed out that the antibody can be used as preventative therapy since there are no side effects, and that it can be more effective than any vaccine that may be developed.*  *""This is the best solution,"" he said. ""The point of making a vaccine is to generalize a neutralizing antibody. So, if you already have one, you don't need to the body to generate one from a vaccine. You've already provided it. You're cutting out the middleman.""*  While the comment about ""no side effects"" is not a direct quote, I am going to take this article at face value.  On the face of it, it's a true statement.  There were no side effects to ""observe"".  Such a statement has, in my opinion, next to no meaning clinically.  They are using ""humanized antibodies"" and this means that they usually take the antibodies from a non-human species and adjust them to match up more closely with the structure of antibodies humans make.  I have yet to see any FDA approved monoclonal antibody that does not have ""any side effects"" listed.  You can look up the FDA approval for any monoclonal antibody such as adalimumab, dupilumab, tocilizumab, etc.    Every single one has many side effects, and those are often related to what is being targeted.  These medications and others are intentionally targeting proteins within our bodies, and that explains why many of them have unique side effects, as they are targeting different proteins, with different targets in our bodies.    While we do not have a ""spike"" protein like the *SARS-CoV-2* on our cells to interact with, and thus the likelihood of the antibodies on some other cells that look like the ""spike protein"" to have any notable effect is low, sometimes medications have side effects that could not have been predicted based on how the medication works.  For example, monitoring organ function such as liver function will likely be important in the initial studies given that the liver is often involved in the metabolism of a monoclonal antibody.  This is one of the reasons why the FDA approval is so comprehensive and lengthy.  Phase 4 clinical trials of a medication involves post-marketing surveillance (looking for side effects even after it is approved).    In other words, just because a clear prediction for what side effects of any might occur cannot be easily made beforehand, does not mean it would be reasonable to say up front that ""there are no side effects"".  Perhaps, one of the reasons this happened is that the CEO, is a PHD, and does not have clinical experience.   **Judgement:** It is extremely premature to say a medication has ""no side effects"" when it has never been tested beyond cells in a lab.  It begs the question how a comment like this could be comfortably made by a CEO.    **What's their plan?**  Fox News: *It was recently announced Sorrento had partnered with New York-based health care system Mount Sinai to develop an antibody cocktail. Dubbed Covi-Shield, the cocktail will be comprised of three different antibodies and, pending FDA approval, will be used as a prophylactic treatment for people returning to work and those who have been exposed to COVID-19.*  *Sorrento officials said that STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the cocktail. They are also looking to develop the antibody as a stand-alone therapy due to its high potency, according to a statement provided to Fox News.*  *""This is the best solution,"" he said. ""The point of making a vaccine is to generalize a neutralizing antibody. So, if you already have one, you don't need to the body to generate one from a vaccine. You've already provided it. You're cutting out the middleman.""*   This is not at all practical to suggest using **three monoclonal antibodies**, all that the same time from a preventative standpoint.  Why is this an issue?  Well unlike other medications that are taken on a daily basis, these monoclonal antibodies tend to stay in your system for a varied period of time depending on how they are metabolized.  Practically speaking, if they actually planned to administer them as a ""cocktail"" in one injection (only way this would make sense as a preventative), ideally you would want for all of those medications to last in your body for roughly the same period of time, so that they can be dosed at the same interval (all three medications every 3 months, or every 2 weeks etc).   There are a number relevant pharmacokinetic reasons why this would be silly as well.  From a manufacturing/cost standpoint, it's a surprising claim.  Put simply, monoclonal antibodies aren't cheap.  Depending on how long the antibodies stayed active, a repeat injection would likely be needed.    There are a number of reasons why a vaccine would be better than a monoclonal antibody.  Vaccines will induce fully human antibodies, and not ""humanized"" antibodies and therefore, in my opinion, the risks or side effects associated with ""humanized"" antibodies versus ""human"" antibodies would not be an issue.  Depending on how the vaccine is designed, it may do more than just induce antibodies, but also recruit other parts of the immune system such as the ""cellular immune response"" and not just a ""humoral immune response"".  In looking at how to defeat any virus, a cellular immune response is in many ways, just as important in my opinion, and sometimes more important depending on the virus and the vaccine design.  One of the beautiful things about our immune system is that it can ""ramp up"" an immune response depending on how much virus is present, and this would not really be possible to do with a monoclonal antibody approach.  One exception, might be, if used therapeutically in a hospital in continuing to provide this to the patient as has been done with tocilizumab etc.  I want to be very clear that this is NOT the same thing as the immune system being ""too active"" such as in the case of the so-called ""cytokine storm"".  In the case of the cytokine storm, the virus is essentially **dysregulating** the immune system to act in this way we wouldn't want them to.  A vaccine, a ""preventative"", or a therapeutic given very early could limit the ability of the virus to replicate and impact the immune system in this way.  In other words, you'd be stopping the virus near the entryway, instead of trying to come in after it has ravaged every floor of your house.  A potential downside to a vaccine is that it does take time for your body to build-up a sufficient immune response, usually one month or more.  **Judgement:** From a preventative standpoint, I would posit that a vaccine has far better risk/benefit profile compared to a the monoclonal antibody approach targeting the virus such as the one reported by Sorrento.  My response here is solely referring to the ""preventative"".  I am NOT saying that monoclonal antibodies are not effective, or would not be effective from a therapeutic standpoint.  I think there is promise/merit in trying to stop/correct the immune system dysregulation that the virus is causing, and these types of antibodies are wholly different from the one(s) being put forth by Sorrento.  **TLDR:**   \- It is clinically meaningless to say you achieved a ""cure"" in lab cells"".  \- I am skeptical of anything being ""100 percent effective"" without the conditions being stated.  \- A medication does not have any side effects until they do, that's why monitoring for side effects is important.  We don't know that we don't know.    \- Three monoclonal antibodies at once is not practical or cost effective.  The safety profile/pharmacokinetics of each one would need to be evaluated/verified, and then likely the same thing would have to be done when all of them are given together (unless they just skipped straight to the trio, which I doubt will happen).    \- **A well-designed vaccine** (both strong humoral and cellular immune responses) would be much better than a monoclonal antibody from a preventative standpoint.    \- Please do not confuse a strong immune response from a vaccine as being similar or related to the dysregulated immune response from the cytokine storm that is caused by the virus.    **Disclaimer:** My post is not intended here as investing advice or investment advice.

Sigh. Not gonna lie I'm kinda disappointed in myself. Just based on the sheer number of positions odds state some of them should have worked out - but here we are - with nothing working.   I could not get on the right side of a trade to save my life today! I either missed the big momentum plays - was too late for them - or didn't FOMO into things when I probably should have. Big one for the day that I almost jumped in but didnt is SRNE - almost jumped in at $5 but didn't - and there go 300% gains. There are more than a few cases in the below where my stops saved me from worse losses though - so I'll take that and be happy.   I'm not going to dissect all of the positions I took - but if I was going to summarize what happened - it was four issues.   1. Missed entries on opening - I was watching things at open and though there would be more of a shakeout before going up - so I missed good prices on TWLO and DDOG which I was tracking. 2. Not leaving at peaks - for UBER and TWTR I was up $100 at one point, but counted on my trailing stops to catch me with profit - but since they both peaked and then dropped I missed out on the profit opportunity. 3. Calling momentum wrong over and over - the rest of my bad plays were emblematic of me just hopping onboard a ride up at exactly the wrong times - I really really had terrible timing for pretty much everything today. 4. Hoping to get even - there were definitely a few things where I was like oh if this goes well I'll get even for the day and call it quits - I should've just cut it in the morning when I was only $20 down. Sitting on cash is a position!  Going to relax over the weekend - do some work for my actual job - and be happy about being up 50% for a weeks work. And also all my money finally arrived! - so I can jump in more throughout the day next week. I actually ended today with around $200 in dry powder, so I'll give myself a pat on the back for restraining when there really weren't any plays.   On the bright side an SLV play I had on my RH account finally printed 100% today - so I pocketed those gains today - an extra $330! So tha'ts money that did print! But I won't be counting it against this total here.   **The Plan:**  1. Get a TDA cash account and fund with $2000 2. Play intra-day swing and momentum trades 3. Cut losses early and often - wins will accumulate over losses. 4. Take profits Regularly    1. Account Balance $4000 - take $2000 to cover initial investment    2. Account Balance $14328 - take $12328 to cover cash losses    3. Account balance of $6057.37 - take $4057.37 to cover equity losses  **Position History:**  Day 5: 5/15 -6.57% ($2665.08 - $2489.82)  |Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |BYND 5/22 120P|\-$18|1|$186|$168| |JD 5/22 50C|\-$14|1|$134|$120| |JD 5/22 51C|\+$1|1|$120|$121| |NEM 5/22 68.5C|\-$23|1|$179|$159| |TWLO 5/22 205C|\-$49|1|$400|$351| |TWTR 5/22 30C|\+$30|3|$73|$78| |UBER 5/22 33C|\-$12|2|$109|$103| |VTIQ 6/19 30C|\-$4|1|$285|$281| |WIX 6/19 240C|\-$55|1|$419|$364| |WORK 5/22 32C|\-$13|1|$129|$116|  &amp;#x200B;  Day 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)  |Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |TWLO 5/22 200c|\-$26|1|$425|$399| |BAC 5/15 21C|\+$63|3|$41|$62| |GS 5/15 172.5C|\+$46|2|$183|$206| |JPM 5/15 87C|\+$135|5|$68|$95| |LCRX 5/15 270C|\-$77|1|$342|$265| |MS 5/15 37.5C|\+$10|5|$44|$46| |WFC 5/15 24C|\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|  &amp;#x200B;  Day 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84  |Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |CODX 6/19 20C|\-$22|1|$277|$255| |TWLO 5/22 200C|\+$174|1|$469|$643| |DDOG 5/15 70C|\+$45|1|$200|$245| |NVDA 5/15 335C|\-$39|1|$213|$174| |ZM 5/15 180C|\-$39|1|$180|$141|  &amp;#x200B;  Day 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57  |Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |CRM 6/19 200C|\+2|1|$263|$265| |EGHT 6/19 20C|\+59|1|$191|$250| |TWLO 5/29 205C|\+30|1|$370|$400| |VTIQ 5/15 30C|\+224|2|$103|$215|  &amp;#x200B;  Day 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34  |Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |DDOG 5/15 55c|\+54|1|$380|$434| |CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\-16|2|$214|$198| |CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\+12|1|$134|$146|  FAQ:  * Why do I have so many day trades with such a small account?    * Cash accounts aren't subject to PDT restrictions - instead what happens is that you can only spend up to the amount of cash you have in a day.For Example - at open today I have $1050 in cash - meaning I could buy up to $1050 in option positions for the day. As long as I sell whatever positions I have by market close - that $1050 plus whatever gains I made during the day are available as cash in my account by market open tomorrow. It does end up limiting the number of positions I can take in a day because I only have so much cash - but it allows me to easily prevent losses by having a tight stop loss - and it allows me to take gains when my positions do well.    * Technical Side:It does take time for the cash to ""settle"", ie. have the transaction be processed. For stocks that is T+2 - meaning your cash is available two days after you close the position.

Following this logic  1. SRNE announced this cure two days ago.  Since then no expert has stepped forward and validated the results 2. Trump  would have embraced this fully if there was significant information  validating their cocktail.  Cure found Go Merica,  Economy saved....  Here's a blank check to SRNE 3. The cocktail may indeed be effective; however, there may be significant impediments in a massive distribution.  Here's some additional research aligning to another GILD look we've got a cure play.  1. The antibody, one of ""hundreds""   it screened, blocks the coronavirus' spike proteins from attaching to    ACE2, a receptor on the surface of healthy cells that serves as a    ""doorknob"" to open the cell to infection. 2. The   company is partnering with NY-based Mount Sinai to develop an   antibody  cocktail, Covi-Shield, comprised of three different  antibodies,   including STI-1499, for prophylactic use. It says it can  produce up to   200K doses per month and is looking to produce ""tens of  millions"" to   meet demand. 3. Reuters reported on the Mt Sinai partnership 8 days ago. [https://www.reuters.com/companies/SRNE.A](https://www.reuters.com/companies/SRNE.A) 4. SNRE's feedback on the results [https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11241/pdf](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11241/pdf) 5. No peer reviews have been provided... doesn't disqualify the results... just so many questions.  If the antibody is so effective by itself, then why do you need three different Antibodies?  Where is the scientific paper showing full recovery on patients within four days?  For that matter where are the patients you cured?  Too many questions coming up.  And  FOX NEWS is pumping it...   Might as well buy calls while we have the  next GILD run.
