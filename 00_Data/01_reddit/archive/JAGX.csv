It’s still well below target price of $5, which it’s a far cry from the $2,000 per share it traded at in 2016. Probably won’t see that number again, but I’m feeling like it should still be a good long term hold. Thoughts? Am I missing something? I only recently started buying little bits of stock around April, so I’m by no means an expert.

I am merely using JAGX as an example.\*  Because of all you beautiful people at [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), the hedge funds and short-sellers had their asses profoundly kicked on GME, BB, and AMC. They've accepted defeat. Citron and Melvin have closed their shorts, at a huge loss. We have local, national, and international support, from the smallest of retail investors to the largest celebrities. We've resisted the slander from hedge funds, who called all of us nazis and far-right based only on examples of insulting language (this argument, by the way, holds no merit, since they don't seem to realize that not everyone on the subreddit actually used this type of language). We can always continue to squeeze the prices up for these stocks to increase their losses, but for the most part, we have won.  However, we must remain vigilant. Behind their huge losses, hedge funds are looking to regain their money. They're moving on. They know they've lost in AMC, GME, and BB, so they are causing unnatural stock price drops in perfectly fine stocks. Take JAGX as an example. Three months ago, it was originally a penny stock but grew due to their proposed ventures in developing post-covid 19 medications. It rose all the way to $4.47 (peak) but dropped down to around $3, where it stayed stable due to lack of new news but lots of investor confidence. Notice the relatively stable chart pattern prior to January 27.  However, January 27 is also the day in which Citron and Melvin have closed their shorts. After accepting their losses, while everyone is focused on GME, AMC, and BB, these hedge funds are now doing their same tricks again on different stocks without many people noticing. Currently, JAGX is in the middle of their crosshairs, hence the huge drop.  This drop is not due to bad news. Many investors that have positions in JAGX are very bullish, due to droves of rumors and good news within the next month. The company is stable and has great fundamentals. Three webinars within 2 weeks is very good for PR. They've announced a merger with another pharmaceutical company. Their post-covid 19 drug was approved in the fricken EU! With all this good news, there is very good investor sentiment, and most would expect the price to go up.   Investors in JAGX have done their DD. They've done their research. They've done their chart analysis. Everything points to a price jump. However, because of Citron, Melvin, and many other hedge funds, these investors are getting screwed over by an unnatural price drop.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4709090.0|public|confidence|self|Hedge funds are moving on to other stocks.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71m5j/hedge_funds_are_moving_on_to_other_stocks/|some_ads|7.0||||||||2021-01-28|JAGX

Please be clear I am not officially accusing any of those parties of anything. Their names are not to be smeared.  However, John is a Harvard graduate who had charges filed against him by the SEC for predatory tactics between 2015-2020 involving penny stocks.. you can read here  [John M. Fife, Chicago Venture Partners, L.P., Iliad Research and Trading, St. George Investments LLC, Tonaquint, Inc., and Typenex Co-Investment, LLC (Release No. LR-24886; Sep. 3, 2020) (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24886.htm) .. watching $JAGX recently, it seems to me as though heavy manipulation is going on, serious sell offs in premarket dropping the stock as much as 15%, only to rise back 10-15% within minutes.  There are also fake walls going up constantly to stop runs, just yesterday there was a roughly 350k ask wall that magically disappeared shortly after.. Again I am not accusing John, Chicago Ventures, or Iliad research of being involved in any illicit activity whatsoever.  However, the activity is very suspicious and alot of retail investors there have been hurting, not able to join the movements you've created in other stocks because they feel realizing the losses they currently have unrealized is a tough pill to swallow.. Plus this is shorted HARD.. check the short numbers from yesterday.. manipulators would potentially profit off of a big move on this ticker, but it would help out alot of distressed retail investors.. I figure this movement is less about punishing wall street and more about bringing power to the people over wall street.. Also $JAGX is a diarrhea medication stock, so that shit would just be funny.. sincerely, someone who is very appreciative that wsb and his community are showing americans that we do still control america if we work together.. whether help comes to $JAGX or not, I'm very proud of all of you.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4524809.0|public|confidence|self|Not Regular Spamming for Personal Gain..

If you can believe it, even after I finished my DD on Aegis I still held some SGNL just waiting for some good pump news so i could exit. That ended up costing me an additional 10% of my investment.   I was listening to a conference call once for SGNL, hoping to hear the news that would finally let me sell this dog, and at the end of the call some *Analysts* asked some questions that seemed overly exuberant. What firm was this analyst from? Aegis Capital, the stock’s underwriter. A word of advice: if you have a stock that you **cant wait** to sell, it’s probably a bad stock and your greed and dreams of buying a space yacht are clouding your judgement.  So I started looking into Aegis, checking a few of the stocks, and it was looking worse and worse. Finally I pulled all of their stocks into a spreadsheet and played around with a few scenarios.   Ok, so let’s say I invested $1M equally on every single one of their IP0s, about $30k in each.. what would I have now? I’d have $500k. Ok, so they deal with a lot of biotech stocks and many of those are speculative, of the 34 IPOs they’ve acted as the lead underwriter, how many have a higher pps than the IPO pps?   One. And it’s gained .05 on rather low volume. So if you invested $1M you’d be up $5k. Yay.   What’s the average return? -49.7% Check this google doc for full details:   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QDFHsothAUIyeJwkCfGPmn3t_djkkMkibalqhtPhUD0/edit?usp=sharing  Pretty much every stock here looks like a classic pump and dump.  So what is Aegis up to? Basically as the underwriter they’re responsible for making sure all of the shares of an IPO are sold. For small cap companies it isn’t too difficult to find a lot of small suckers (and maybe a few big ones) through marketing the stock and planting pumps on websites like this one, StockTwits and different investing message boards.   I'm sure they have this down to a science, and truly selling $10M of a ""Genetic Cancer Test Stock"" like SGNL is pretty easy if you think about it. Do I think SGNL is a sham company? Probably not a total sham, but I don't think they have any novel technologies and I don't see them being any more successful than they are now (read: bleeding money to sell and place their tests, which may or may not be useful), and earning higher than average industry salaries (CEO makes 500k a year.. yes, really) and probably making some nice bread on the side speculating in the company stocks knowing when PR pieces will hit.   And like $GBSN, dilution, lots of dilution (I have DD on GBSN and Dawson James Securities if anyone is interested). I'd imagine Aegis and the principals of SGNL have profited numerous times on this stocks PR, pumping and then dumping.     Additionally, Aegis heavily markets their stocks using paid placements and email marketing, this is something that reputable companies *sometimes* do in order to get more attention for their stock, but it’s uncommon among the more reputable firms.   This Glass Door review of Aegis puts its mildly that most of the deals traded down, so it was hard to keep customers.  https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Aegis-Capital-Reviews-E388111.htm  Also, Aegis has had its share of lawsuits and FINRA fines:   https://www.finra.org/newsroom/2015/finra-fines-aegis-capital-corp-950000-sales-unregistered-penny-stocks-and-aml  Here's a full list of stocks that Aegis has underwritten:  •	CADTU •	TFSCU •	GGACU •	REPH •	IRT •	RTTR •	JAGX •	BVXV •	EYEG •	BHACU •	CNLMU •	ORPN •	MTBC •	GBIM •	SGNL •	ALDX •	PIH •	RTGN •	SMLR •	NRX •	BIOC •	AKER •	EVOK •	HTBX •	XGTI •	RCAP •	ADHD •	CGIX •	OAKS •	IPDN •	ORC •	STML •	CTF •	JMI   *Possible Plays:*   If you shorted everything here that hasn't lost a lot of its value yet, Aegis' track record says that it will soon-- and a lot of it. And if it does gain value, it's clear that it won't gain much, and whatever it gains won't be sustained. As pointed out, out of 34 IPOs **one** of them is in the green from the IPO pps, and most are down 50%, some in the 80-90 range.
