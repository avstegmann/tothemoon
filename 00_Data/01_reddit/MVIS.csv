Last week, I posted my first ever DD on MVIS. You can read it here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs\_friday\_dd\_mvis/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs_friday_dd_mvis/)  If you missed it, today MVIS took flight as it pulled 50%ish on the day. It took liftoff at the start of power hour and, after 20 glorious minutes, began the trend sideways to eventually close at $18.55 (up from sub-$14.00).  **Why did this happen?**  Well, Microsoft won a contract with the U.S. Army for augmented-reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 B over 10 years: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)  I believe, as I explain in my DD, MVIS is going to continue it's rise all throughout 2021. I have different price targets depending on scenarios but for the short-term, I believe MVIS will hit $29 by end of the month (APR).  **How will it get there? What's new this past week besides the spike?**  1. MVIS is going to be showing off their LiDAR in an APR demo. They were still on track to meet their goals during their last report. 2. Biden Infrastructure Plan - Building a national EV charging system, promoting vehicle exchanges from less efficient gas-powered cars to full EV or hybrid EVs. EVs and autonomous vehicles go hand-in-hand so this plan is great for MVIS as well. 3. MORE job openings (up to 17 now thus confirming my claim last week that hiring would ramp up): [http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj](http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj) 4. Buyout possibility still on the table from a T1 tech company that *may or may not* already be invested in MVIS tech (RE: MVIS DD) 5. MVIS dropped hard with the NASDAQ dumping last week but as of today is the BEST recovery stock impacted 6. Short-interest is still a factor with &gt;1 day to cover:  Short Volume Ratio: 13% (down from 30% last week) - [https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis)  % of Volume Shorted as of Mar. 30: 33.46% (down from 64.98% last week) - [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS)  % of Shares Shorted: 15.32% (up from 12.64% last week) - [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/)  Summary Quote: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&amp;submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&amp;submit=Short+Quote)  There are excellent long and short-term opportunities to play here. So for those feeling the FOMO, I believe there's still plenty of time to get in even if the sub-$14.00 bargain price is gone.  **Positions**  * Shares - 600 @ 14.46 (up from 100 at $13.33) * Options - Closed my contracts today during the run, will be reopening positions when I calibrate my goals tomorrow  **Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor.

Today at 3:00 pm one of the news came out  [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)  Summary : Microsoft wins US army contract for augmented-reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years.  **You might be asking, Hey idiot that's Microsoft contract, not MVIS?**  Microsoft has launched Hololens 1 in 2016 and Hololens 2 in 2019 May. Many of us did not see the product in real life because the technology inside cost a lot, and Hololens 2 is being sold above $3000 for commercial business.  apparently, If you teardown Hololens2, you will see very critical module that enables AR headset made by MVIS.  Reddit doesn't allow to post youtube link, search, ""hololens 2 teardown""  If you watch, you will see MVIS modules in the Hololens2. YES if Microsoft is going to make an AR headset to US army, they have to use MVIS module in it. This significantly improves future cashflow for the company, especially we all know growth stocks are having trouble of generating revenue until the company ripens. I am sure MVIS will not go bankrupt by now.  **How can you be sure Microsoft will use MVIS's module in the AR headset?**  This is basically can be analyzed by looking at MVIS's technology. Does the company have enough intellectual properties that no other companies can be followed?  From MVIS homepage, you will se their technology foundation.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fyvjxqjfgfq61.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f1acb833c2686be966ca04a4382ffb46bb90e52  MVIS Technology  MVIS has been found in 1993 and has been developing all intellectual property that no other followers can catch up easily. This will enforce MVIS's business and further, it would be possible to make profit from licensing their intellectual property in the future.  Summary: If Microsoft Hololens 2 does not use MVIS's technology, that would be a scam AR headset.  **Stock price has been pumped by 50% today and hit $18.55, is it still a buy?**  **YES and YES.** Recently, the stock price has been pushed down, we all know it was because of the fear of 10-yr bond yield has been increased sharply, which increases the discount level of growing tech stocks which do not generate much cash flow.  However, for MVIS, it stepped one more stop up to the MOON. Now the risk of getting bankruptcy, creating revenue bas been significantly decreased. Remember once you have a contract with US army and a company like Microsoft, your company's portfolio starts to shine and it will extend its business exponentially.  Further, Keep in mind that MVIS is also targeting automobile market where they need Lidar sensor.I understand you like stocks like apple, tesla, oh **GME, AMC, BB,** but MVIS is also a strong bull stock if you look far enough.  I think today's news is just the beginning, with all of you degenerates, I will see you guys on the MOON.  TL;DR  I LIKE THE STOCK MVIS GME AMC BB MOON.  I haven't prepared much for a DD post, it is my first time writing it. hope you like it. if you wanna know about more details, please leave a comment. I will keep editing if more contents needed.

They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.  They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don’t care if they are right or wrong on their “research” because they will profit on their short position regardless.  Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float – these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their “reports”).  Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM – to name a few.  &amp;#x200B;  **Where do they get their research?**  This is the million-dollar question.  They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.  In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on “conversations they had” with undisclosed “former employees” of the company.  Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.  That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don’t imagine she’s going to have too many nice things to say.  &amp;#x200B;  **Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**  Let’s be clear. This is no Nikola.  Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.   Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a “quiet-period” right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.  Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [“thorough” statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will “absolutely” be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.  &amp;#x200B;  **In summary:**  I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.  In addition, I’ll let you be the judge – should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?  What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.

The answer here is pretty obvious.   Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack.

If this is relative to other brands they could jump almost 100% in stock price over the months following the addition to that exchange. * William Li met with Sinopec (second largest Oil Company and owner of 30,000+ gas stations) in early February. During NIO day William Li announced a second gen battery station. This potential partnership would create battery swap stations at a butt load of Sinopec gas stations.

Do your own research before making any investment. I am biased due to holding MVIS shares.**  MVIS had an earnings call on Thursday during which the CEO Sumit Sharma was noticeably excited and mentioned that the company was for sale several times, including direct quote “In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring synergic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”  Here is a transcript of the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a)  And here is the audio from the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933)  I’m not going to post any DD because there’s already a bunch of amazing DD over at r/MVIS. I suggest you check it out.  There’s been speculation by longtime MVIS holders of a buyout for quite some time now due to their LiDAR (their product) being used in Microsoft’s HoloLens, but since LiDAR is also getting hyped as the technology that will make self-driving cars possible, some other players have emerged as potential partners / buyers. Again, check out all the DD on r/MVIS.  I’m posting this because WSB has changed my life. The only reason I have any money to invest is because of ideas from this subreddit and I want to pay it forward by contributing to the knowledge base. For anyone trying to find solid DD, sifting through all the posts, maybe not being able to afford something as expensive as GME - this is for you.

I wouldn’t look for an announcement that someone took an equity stake. I wouldn't look for an announcement that Lidar A-Sample is already done. In my opinion these are not realistic expectations and may not happen at the 4th Qtr Earnings CC.  However, I would look for an update on all of the relevant topics with a positive spin… that’s the new MicroVision where the minor dilution of (2.5 million shares sold for $50 million) was done before the 4th Qtr Earnings CC, and not afterwards as has been the case over the past 15 years.  I expect MVIS stock to move forward and not backwards. I would NOT expect that everything is status quo. MicroVision of today is an energetic, vibrant and a wealthy company with a market cap of over $2.5 billion… a historical high.  So if you own the stock now at the current price and we find out that things are improving and progressing well, why would you sell?  I would look for a mention that we have 50 million more going into 4th Qtr Earnings CC, that we didn't have a few weeks ago. I would expect that the Lidar A-Sample is on target for April and some key specs have improved. I would expect that we have multiple companies conducting due diligence toward acquiring the company.  **MicroVision: Why a $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**  Real billion dollar ideas have trillion dollar market size, they are scalable, and leverage the drivers of growth to go viral or global.  In my last [research on MicroVision ](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-holds-the-keys-to-the-future-3000-profit-potential-in-over-10-billion-ma-article-132.aspx#.YEpP3Z1KjIU)(NASDAQ: MVIS), I introduced this 20 year old high-tech company that is at the cusp of acquisition by a major technology company. In the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \[from 25 cents to over $15\] on well qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12-months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.  **Here's the short answer...**  Each of the Six LBS core technology verticals can spawn Trillion dollar markets of the future. Considering the diversity of its product line, built around the LBS core technology over the last 20 years, and protected by it's IP and 500 patents, each core vertical can spawn markets worth trillions, and be worth billions in an acquisition or a merger.  **Why sell the company or merge with a deep pocket Tier 1 Technology partner...**  At low volumes, the cost of components that MicroVision sells to its Tier 1 partners is 5 to 10 times higher than what it is sold for in anticipation of large quantities... and loosing money on each component sold is what has shaped the company's past blunders loosing millions of dollars each quarter for the last 15 years.  Finally, to sell the company, or to sell one or all of its 6 core vertical engines that can spawn trillion dollar markets, is the right decision. Under the leadership and stewardship of a deep pocket Tier 1 technology partner from the FAMGA gang can truly realize the potential of MicroVision technology, and bring hundred of products to the market that will be sold in billion units per year.  In the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \[from 25 cents to over $14.95\] on qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12- months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.  [**What to expect from sale or merger of MicroVision...**](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-30-stock-when-acquired-for-5-billion-article-127.aspx#.Xz3sPchKjIX)  Over the last 3 decades, the FAMGA tech giants — Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple — have collectively made [770 acquisitions](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table). Even amid the Covid-19 pandemic, some have continued to write checks, with Apple being the [most active acquirer in 2020 to date](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?sdate=2020-01-01&amp;edate=2020-05-05&amp;invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table) among them.  This FAMGA group of acquirers has deep pockets. Some of their biggest checks have been written for high-profile companies such as career platform [LinkedIn](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/linkedin) (acquired by Microsoft for $26.2B), chat app [WhatsApp](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/whatsapp) (Facebook for $22B), and video-sharing platform[YouTube](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/youtube) (Google for $1.7B).  Luminar Technologies ([LAZR](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR?p=LAZR)) went public and the stock price at $40 dollars more than doubled in two days as a public company, with a market cap of over $14 billion… and made its co-founder CEO Austin Russell a billionaire ─ at the age of 25. Luminar specializes in making Lidar sensors for the [automotive sector](http://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/) that will be used in the development of autonomous vehicles.  However, the keys to several future technologies are being held by an older company MicroVision that was always ahead of its time. [MicroVision](http://www.microvision.com/) (MVIS), founded in 1993, is most famous for their Micro Electro Mechanical systems (MEMs) and Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) technology that is protected by over 500 patents.  MicroVision’s automotive Lidar will be packaged in a solid-state module that is smaller, cheaper and more versatile than potential competitors like Luminar and Velodyne.  Autonomous vehicles of the future will utilize MicroVision’s Lidar because it is a superior “Best in Class” technology compared to Luminar and Velodyne; and due to its small size, 280M range, and point cloud density of 20 million points per second.

This is not financial advice and I am NOT a financial advisor! I just really like this stock.   Quick history lesson for you apes, Microvision is an old company, older than you (probably). These mamma jammas have been slanging since ‘96. What business have they been in you may be wondering? The future mother fucker. VR, Augmented Reality, Laser Imaging. These people grew up in the ‘90’s watching shit like Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, The Matrix. They watched these futuristic films and thought to get ahead of the curve and get into the business of future tech early.   Microvision is headquartered in Washington, and as a tech company that’s a big deal. That means they aren't an overvalued silicon value trust fund baby. To viciously oversimplify what this company is vested in; their tech is applied to display applications ( Projections / VR), sensing (LiDAR), and Display and Sensing ( ??Augmented Reality?? ).   The only application of their tech I give a single fuck about is the automotive sensing. Sure VR is great for when I’m watching my Brazzers and I really want to feel like I’m getting laid since I am too afraid to go outside or talk to people in the real world, but on a large scale economic evaluation the VR industry is a moot point.   $TSLA (Shameless papa Elon Simp) is arguably the best current automotive manufacturer on the planet. Every other automotive manufacturer is looking to take some pointers from them and start down their own path of autonomous driving. When it comes to autonomous driving there are 3 different types of technology that can be used to achieve this. Camera sensors, Radar sensors, and LiDAR sensors. Please go through this informative piece to educate yourself on autonomous driving you silly mongoloid.   [https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars](https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars).   TL&amp;DR : Of the three major sensors, LiDAR is the best in terms of quality of sensing, but the drawback to this technology is the cost of use. When it comes to LiDAR there are two major types of sensor arrays, ones that spin and move a bunch and ones that don’t. Can you guess which ones would be more preferred by an automobile manufacturer? \*\*\* hint it doesn't move \*\*\*  [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range)  Microvision has released a statement that it is now able to build a stationary LiDAR sensor around a sub-$1000 price point and this sensor will meet all of the specifications set by car manufacturers.

Coincidence ? I think not. This tells us two very important things about this tech and the direction of the automotive industry. First, automotive manufacturers see the value in LiDAR as the technology of choice for autonomous vehicles. Next, they are positioning themselves well ahead of the curve to be seeded in the correct positions to win.

On April 4, 2021 automotive manufacturers will  finally be able to get their hands on these sensors and (assuming they meet all OEM requirements like they already said they can) MVIS is more than well positioned to be the LiDAR company of choice for all automotive manufacturers looking to enter the autonomous driving industry. As manufacturers they have already shown their investments into this technology will come early and fast. It is impossible for anyone to predict if the company will be acquired or if they will lease/partner up, but all the information points to the rapid success of MVIS in the automotive sensors industry.

I would appreciate your input or maybe get this DD trending so that the community here can collectively provide input and then each of you decide for yourselves what you want to do with the information.  We see a lot of tickers get thrown around on Reddit, StockTwits, Discord, Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter....you get the point. Everyone who has at least one thumb and a brokerage account wants to share what they claim to be the best stock ever that ""hasn't been found yet,"" and really it's just the same tickers that we've seen since March, 2020 and the person has been holding a bag this whole time. That being said, I am very skeptical of what I hear, basically believing none of it. I do my own research, my own screening, etc. However, if the person can provide some solid information that will get my attention, I will listen, and then dive down the DD rabbit hole, fucking Alice in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) style. So, let us begin.  The ticker is $TRCH, and I'm sure some of you have seen it already. I'm betting some of you have a few hundred or thousand shares. Good! Now if you're unsure of why you bought it, or if you have never heard of this ticker before, let me break it down for you.  $TRCH recently did an offering, which scares a lot of traders, but shouldn't depending on the circumstances. Lately, we've seen the opposite effect occur during offerings, where the stock runs higher rather than having a huge dip from panicking traders who sell as soon as they see the SEC filing. TRCH did an offering because they had to in order to get to the level of cash they needed. Thats because they have HUGE plans, and it starts with them merging with Meta. Meta, is also HUGE! Some of Meta's customers and partners include Sony, Airbus, Panasonic, Boeing, Mazda, ThermoFisher Scientific, but most importantly for TRCH, Samsung. Why do we care about Samsung? And why do we care about TRCH when they're just an energy resource company that is apparently selling off all of their assets? Just shut up and listen.  Metamaterial, (OTC:MMATF), announced the signing of a definite agreement for a business combination with Torchlight Energy (TRCH) back in December. Okay, so if Meta is an OTC, how are they so huge? Well, because to understand a companies value and potential value, we have to look at not only their financials but also the leadership and direction they are taking their company. There are a lot of successful and cash heavy companies that aren't publicly traded. And stocks rise in value based on forward looking speculation. I mean, look at TSLA. Meta is the real deal, and are in a bunch of different markets. They have billion dollar potential, because they're in all of the RIGHT markets. We're talking markets like EV, LED, Solar, GlucoWise, Holography, Lithography, MRI, and others. They have 89 filed patents (54 granted) across 28 patent families (21 granted), 5 registered trademarks, and proprietary, custom manufacturing processes and trade secrets, developed over 10 years with multi-million dollar investments. Just check out the new investor presentation. Fuck it, if you've read this far, I'll just share some info from the presentation for you, right now.  In the presentation, there is mention of a biosensor. ""This smartphone attached biosensor under development uses nonmaterial for molecular fingerprint detection in a range of applications (such as COVID-19 and others)"" and ""Daily use biosensor with sensitivity and performance enhanced using nano-material, to meet rising demand for point of care testing"" and then quotes a market potential of $10+B. That B is for Billion. Global Biosensors Market is expected to reach USD 41.29 billion by 2027. They want a huge piece of the pie, and this is just one emerging sector they are in.  If they are projecting 10 billion market potential, and TRCH market cap isn't even 500 million....BOOM!  IMO, the offering on TRCH was the chance to buy, but if you didn't get in then, Monday would be the time to get in because they have been trading much lower the past two days, following a couple hit pieces by SeekingAlpha. By the way, the people who wrote the hit pieces on TRCH, you guessed it....they are shorting it. More on them in a moment. Just always remember, SeekingAlpha is garbage.  They (TRCH) regularly have a huge short percentage (was 32% short interest on February 10, and today the short volume ratio was 26%) which means that a WHOLE LOT OF SHORTS ARE GONNA LEARN! Shorts have had fun and they've been getting cocky the past couple days. That's about to change come Monday, February 22nd. Lets examine the shorts, shall we...  White Diamond Research....yup, they're the guys who wrote the SeekingAlpha hit pieces. This group is the biggest bear group I know, and the sad part, they're absolutely terrible at it. They claim a 90% success rate and 3rd party verification, but how they came to making that statement I have no idea. Just look at what they have shorted! $RIOT; they went bearish and took a short position at $2.41......and RIOT was trading on Friday at a peak of $77.80! That is over a ***3,200% increase!*** Someone call an ambulance, but not for me! They took a short position on $GP in December when it was trading at $18.33 and it was trading today at over $30.....oof. They took a short position on CLSK in October when it was trading at $10.75, and just like all the other short positions they take, they wrote hit pieces on CLSK and gave it a $3 price target, which would have been a 77% decrease in value from the level they took their position. What is CLSK trading at now? They are at $34 at this moment, and were over $42 earlier this week! That's 14X the bull shit price target they gave back in October. That's a ***1,400% difference!*** They also shorted MVIS when it was trading at $2.02 in August, 2020. Considering MVIS is trading at $20.13 at this very moment, and peaked at $24.18 this week, I'd say it is safe to say that White Diamond Research Group should consider changing their name to We Don't Research Group. I know, that was a terrible attempt at making a joke. I'm not that funny. But I know how to do DD!  What we can derive from their actual track record when shorting literally any stock, is that White Diamond Research sucks so good at what they do, that if you invest in anything they short, you're almost guaranteed to double, triple, maybe even 35x your money! Makes you wonder if they're trying to play some reverse psychology here and scoop up shares for themselves with really cheap fire sales...  The merger is less than three weeks away (March 12) and yet 48% have already voted in favor of it (I'm sure by now that number has increased, as this is based off of a tweet by the CEO a few days ago). So yeah, the CEO tweeted this and said he was looking forward to March 12th. But does what the insiders tweet really matter? Absolutely, and we have all seen how CEO's with an active presence on twitter has been good for a plethora of other publicly traded companies. So yes, it absolutely does matter, especially if they put their money where their mouth is! So lets take a look at insider ownership and if there has been an increase or decrease. Well, first up is Greg McCabe, Director at TRCH. He recently bought 1,630,434 shares of his own company. At the time, it was worth $749,999.64 and since then the offering has closed, and evidently he is still holding every single last one of his shares. Diamond Hands Greg is going to give White Diamond 'Paper Hands' Research Group a run for their money! Overall, insider ownership transactions have increased by 20.43% according to FinViz, showing a lot of buying, and nobody selling!  TRCH also will be giving a special dividend, which will also attract bigger fish. Why else do current investors have a reason to hold? Because, when the merger goes through on March 12, Torchlight is expected to sell off its oil and gas assets by June 30, 2021. What is that worth? $33,463,330 and this would become a one time payment to shareholders.  Meta also recently acquired Interglass, a Swiss Lens Manufacturer. We can understand the reason why and the potential when we read from one of their recent filings; ""META will invest and expand its capabilities in design, development, and manufacturing of metaFUSION(TradeMarked) products for smart eyewear. This highly integrated solution combines embedded metamaterial and functional film elements with precision cast corrective lenses, which are required by over 50% of potential users in the market.""  So, basically, META is in every emerging market, but they're still OTC, which means merging with TRCH is basically the missing piece. Then, after the merger, I am sure many of META's wonderful partners will have great PR lined up. Considering the amount of shorts and Paper Hands White Diamond Research Group betting against TRCH, I'm betting there will be a massive squeeze. I see TRCH running up all the way to merger, starting next week after the market has found its correction, which I believe was finally, this past Friday.  As of today, TRCH is undervalued, has a catalyst(merger), is cash heavy, debt free, and the merger is with META which puts them in emerging markets. My analysis is that this merger will drive the price up beginning next week all the way through and after the merger is complete, shorts will all get squeezed, and based on being cash heavy, in emerging markets, and forward speculation, this stock will be a $20 stock in a few months. I think it's possible we see $8-$10 by March 12th, and depending on how epic the short squeeze is and how many people find this company, it could go parabolic to $30+ before settling around $22.  If all of this isn't enough to convince you that $TRCH is going to run hard and fast, with organic continuation for months afterwards, let me fill you in on a bonus piece of information. Remember how I said I would write more on $TSLA? Yeah, so apparently TRCH is working with TSLA. Don't believe me? Do some DD of your own, and look up this address; 1 Research Drive, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia B2Y 4M9, Canada.  I took a long position as of Friday morning. I have been skeptical until I did weeks of research and watched the stock run up and then come back down after it got a small pump from Atlas. That is another good sign. If veterans/founders of the Discord group, Atlas, are all long in TRCH, I'd say that is a good indication that this could really run up to $20-$30 in the next couple months, and $12 within the next 3 weeks, which is a 400% increase from its closing price on Friday. If it goes parabolic and reaches $30, that's a ***1,000% increase!*** This stock also has the behavior of a parabolic runner, and I'm thinking it will perform more like RIOT over the course of the next year. It will run up to $20 within a couple months, and as their emerging market technology is PR'd, it will continue to run up every few weeks, making higher highs, and higher lows each time.  \------"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9175967.0|public|confidence|self|The Ultimate DD on $TRCH w/Price Targets (by u/Mr_Delmont; sharing w/ permission)|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lodjkx/the_ultimate_dd_on_trch_wprice_targets_by_umr/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||2021-02-20|MVIS

An easy 25-30% gain isn’t so bad and much more to come.  Now you people need to learn about PSTH.  I’d say go to r/PSTH for the DD but the truth is, there really isn’t any DD to be had.  This is a SPAC which means their sole purpose is to take our cash and go buy a company to bring public.    Rumours are that it’s Stripe which has been said to be the next $1T dollar company but who knows, maybe it’s Bloomberg, StarLink or any number of amazing opportunities.  You buy PSTH for the man on top, which is Bill Ackman.  He’s rich and is good at making money, do you need to know more?  The best part is he’s supposed to announce in Q1 and could even be this week or next.  Upon announcement this thing may double or triple and over the next months/years this could be a steady climb to a 10-20 bagger or more.    Buy in increments of 9 shares to maximize warrants.  Go read the S1 if you care why.  TLDR: Buy PSTH. Shares, options, anything really and let some rich guy make you rich.

Disclaimer: I am no way affiliated with Microvision, and this was created by me on January 24, 2020 to help spread information about the company. I am currently an investor of $MVIS and help moderate a forum on reddit - /r/mvis  Investment/Technology Speculation DD for Microvision – Microvision has been working and perfecting technology for a future emerging market for 28 years and those emerging markets have finally arrived.   In these slides, I will introduce Microvision, and their verticals, and why their technology is considered disruptive by many of their investors, and why I invested in the company, and stay invested after 3 years.  This Gallery does not go over financial DD of $MVIS, which you can easily do by going through their quarterly reports found here: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zv1ozb3alwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf37a3c8249de88d8314f71c6c5dac5de2f5a721  Microvision was founded in 1993 to commercialize Virtual Retinal Display technology, in which images are drawn directly on the viewer’s retina.  Massive amounts of wealth has been pushed into R&amp;D and patents, and has taken their toll in the past 28 years, accumulating a $572.6M deficit as of Dec 31, 2019. This amount has allowed them to accumulate 484 Granted and Pending Patents, and 28 years worth of Intellectual Property in design, testing, and manufacturing laser scanning devices.   Microvision is currently run by CEO Sumit Sharma. Before joining MicroVision Sumit Sharma was also Head of Operations for Google Glass for over 2.5yrs.   On April 2, 2020 they hired Craig-Hallum to help them find a strategic investment (which include M&amp;A).. They signed Mark Spitzer, and Judy Curran to the board to help them facilitate this strategic investment.   [https://i.imgur.com/Z79WElk.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/Z79WElk.mp4)   Microvision is the leader in MEMs Laser Beam Scanners (LBS). A key technology which could unlock consumer grade near eye displays, and long range automotive LIDAR.  (Explain like I’m 5) – The lasers work in coordination with the mems mirror. A current is applied through the silicon, which produces a “wobble” as seen in the gif. ASICs (basically a chip) controls the lasers, and the wobble of the mirror to be able to paint a 1440p image at 120hz (in the Hololens 2). The same method is applied with an infrared laser to be able to track objects, and provide 20 million pts/s.   [https://i.imgur.com/wcQh0av.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/wcQh0av.mp4)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/y2g2qtcelwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fabc8c68c5385741a6bb69154d2057ee8d46c687  Microvision allowed Microsoft to double their field of view (surface area), by switching from Liquid Crysta on Silicon Panels (built by Himax), to the laser scanning system without increasing the volume of the Light engine, while reducing the weight, and power found in the Hololens 2.   The doubling of field of view, does not mean less pixels per inch either.. As Hololens 2 has been able to maintain their pixel density, allowing user to be able to still read fine print through the near eye displays, unlike other components.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0qgqb8hglwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1a255a3e202a3e33dd328094bdb52dbe402d635  The basic concept of why Microsoft switched from a “Panel” type display like Liquid Crystal on Silicon, and decided not to use more expensive, and less mature technologies like MicroLED or MicroOLED is that with the panel type displays, the panel needs to proportionally get larger as the field of view expands. This makes it a challenge for designers and engineers trying to make a light weight consumer near eye display for augmented reality and mixed reality.  The beauty of the laser scanners is by adding a mirror, and a RGB module, they can change the angle, and create a larger FOV without proportionally getting larger.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wvdmh9whlwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=405bc391b0b630fadec2f1e702032e3acb6566e8  Sharp / Socle (Foxconn) have already roadmapped a smaller RGB Laser Module to be used for near eye displays. Their mass production of these modules will only make it cheaper to use, as the technology accelerates. This also solves other issues regarding how much power the lasers draw (barely already), being able to create even greater efficiencies in immersion by creating wider field of views and something called “foveated rendering” which reducers graphical processing power by up to 70% in some cases.  High definition, wide field of view, low cost of processing. Holy grail of near eye displays. This is another reason why we believe Dr. Mark Spitzer come out of retirement, to join Sumit Sharma on the Board of Directors of Microvision.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p0e6037jlwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f3f9c904bf72bed7e8d7c8ca2979523ba9cfc27   The estimated increase in the market is going to be a total of 41.3% more each year.     2021 - 8.6 Billion    2022 - 12.2 Billion    2023 - 17.2 Billion    2024 - 24.3 Billion    2025 - 34.3 Billion    Or an estimated market market opportunity of 96.6 Billion dollars total of potential in the next 5 years. Now if a purchase of MVIS can capture even 30% of that potential, a purchase of the company, even with the associated yearly operating expenditures of many million dollars a year, the potential market share would be nearly 29 Billion dollars of value. How much does a prospective buyer pay for just the AR related MVIS tech when they could control 30% of a nearly 100 Billion dollar market over the next 5 years?   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/mz9kb5amlwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28babfab420bd7b8495f9403eccb11552dade481  There is no confirmation that Microsoft is utilizing Laser Beam Scanners for their Integrated Visual Augmentation System contract for the US Army.   We only have Microsoft patents that show how they plan on achieving wider FOV’s, and that the Hololens 2 was used as the platform to create the IVAS device. Currently Microvision has not given guidance for finances in 2021, which we assumed is because of ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) regulations and NDAAs.  Most evidence we've compiled is circumstantial, but it's the same kind of information that allowed us to realize Microsoft was utilizing Laser Beam Scanners from Microvision in the first place.   [https://i.imgur.com/zvAVmDt.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/zvAVmDt.mp4)  Microvision is leveraging their 28 years of experience to create small (size of a VHS tape), powerful (OVER 200m range), and wide FOV’s (dynamically changing).  Re: How this is Solid State-  The weight/mass is so minimal, it is considered part of the chip... impervious to vibration. If I understand it correctly. From a physics perspective, imagine a brick and a tiny piece of fabric sitting on the passenger seat next to you when you drive. The brick is going to jump around with every bump. The fabric will be unaffected. Too small and light.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/cnjxk9gplwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=324e879cb90b51945f4185a246d6db4f9552ff7d  Low cost, small size.  Think of how Microvision was able to create an interactive laser projection system in a smart speaker with an MSRP of $199. One word: “Scalability”   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ggugl6mrlwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d88e4376836248a0d117abd25e92e9d7254aea  Luminar, the market leader for LIDAR with it’s recent SPAC, is currently using a Mechanical MEMS system utilizing a polygon mirror the size of your eye, that spins aong with a planar mirror.  Their “Solid State” Lidar solution called IRIS doesn’t have very much published information, but a dive into their patent holdings shows the use of DMD style MEMS (solid state) which is owned by Texas Instruments.   This is the same technology used in Laser Projectors for theatres, that have excessive heat, excessive price, and excessive sizes (due to the heat sinks and fans required to manage the heat).   Had to look up the Luminar patent to find the vertical FOV, 120degx45degx300pts per squaredegree = 1.6 Million points... and we can't even complete the calc because hey maybe it refreshes a bunch of times a second...   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/goj7oa5tlwd61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60e42f5eb684c8d339f2909242e52b091b527a9f  Craig-Hallum and Microvision are currently focused on finding a strategic alternative, which incudes the possible sale of the company. It’s a dragged out process, but we’ve found multiple Tier 1’s that have shown they plan on expanding into the space Microvision currently holds large IP for (near eye displays and Lidar) which would unlock Consumer grade products for these OEMs.   Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook is just a small sample… which would include companies like Amazon, Google and other large whales.   &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img rjmw70julwd61...*   Thanks for reading.

It's me, ya boy. Back to talk some more about my favorite play right now, Microvision! **I have used this dip opportunity to more than double my previous position. Positions at bottom.**  As you all know from my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5hwiu/microvisions_macrovision_the_story_of_an/), Microvision is unbelievably undervalued in the marketplace right now. They have not only have **best in class LiDAR** for consumer and automotive (TWO verticals!), but they also have **best in class MEMS** displays (MSFT Hololens 2 and IVAS display, another vertical and **MSFT with a gov contract!**)!   # WHY I'M BACK AGAIN  Mainly for two reasons then we can jump in  1. **A POTENTIAL MAJOR CATALYST COMING TOMORROW** 2. The current formation of the chart looks **IDENTICAL TO THE LAST RUN FROM $3 TO $9+**  # Reason 1 - System Plus Consulting full Hololens 2 teardown and report available tomorrow  This is could be a **MAJOR** catalyst tomorrow when this [full report is released](https://www.systemplus.fr/reverse-costing-reports/microsoft-holographic-lens-from-hololens-2/). As we already know, thanks to the guys over at r/MVIS [(LINK TO THREAD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/l61w3p/microsoft_holographic_lens_from_hololens_2_system/), the Hololens 2 **IS CONFIRMED TO USE MICROVISION MEMS DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY -** [SOURCE 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/)(8 months ago) **+** [SOURCE 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/kxf2to/microvision_mems_mirror_in_the_hololens_2_the/)(12 days ago)**. This should finally lift the veil on Microvision and start getting more institutional and retail investors jumping in.**  &amp;#x200B;  # Reason 2 - Crayon drawings look IDENTICAL to last 300% pop!  **Please forgive me for my awful crayon drawing, I had to use an old box because I ate all the new ones.....but check this out!**  [🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/ufmg7qbwfwd61.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=789b3ba55ccf39d855024c41039eabd31b5e2902)  Wow! What a chart! If you want a **more in-depth look,** [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck7IvrgglDw&amp;feature=emb_title). But Look at all those circles! I've even color-coordinated them, to help our smooth brains. All I'll say is, compare the circles. See how each one looks like it is setting up to be identical?   1. Green circles - The first one is the first 3 days of upwards movement towards the boom, looking like we have the first few bars of that setup already 2. Red circles - the second one looks like it is going to finish today with a lot of indecisiveness in the direction and suppression from the resistance line right there. **This is playing out the same exact way as last time**. Last time we fucked with a heavy resistance then broke it and started the major run the next day. 3. Blue circles - Check out those increasing volume trends. If you can see the faded brown circles in the blue ones, check out the low ass volume coming in on those days followed by a **BOOM** 4. Black circles - RSI, you probably haven't read this far but looks like we can run up and out of the purple again  **IF HISTORY HOLDS TRUE, WE CAN SEE A 300+% PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE COMING DAYS.**  &amp;#x200B;  # CONCLUSION  To wrap this up, let's take another quick look at the LiDAR competitors in the market...  **Luminar (LAZR)**  * **Stock Price - $39.39 (+$3.07, +8.25%)** * **Market Cap - 12.731B** * **Float - 177.19M** * **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**  **Velodyne (VLDR)**  * **Stock Price - $26.23 (+$1.08, +4.22%)** * **Market Cap - 4.433B** * **Float - 55.52M** * **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**  **Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...  **Microvision (MVIS)**  * **Stock Price - $7.79** * **Market Cap - 1.02B** * **Float - 145.69M** * **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**  Just looking at the pure numbers and math of how this works out, **MVIS SHOULD SEE A PRICE TARGET OF AT LEAST 3X, IF NOT 4-6X!** And that is just looking at the **ONE AUTOMOTIVE LIDAR VERTICAL**. **If you add in their other verticals? Holy shit can this baby start to FLY**🚀🚀🚀🚀  &amp;#x200B;  **TL:DR - MICROVISION IS STILL EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED BY AT LEAST 3X, CHART LOOKS IDENTICAL TO LAST 300% RUN, THEY ARE BEST IN CLASS IN MULTIPLE VERTICALS**  **TL:CR - $MVIS**  🌙🌚🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  &amp;#x200B;    **POSITIONS:**   * **2/19**    * **2 - $6 Call @ $1.54**    * **28 - $8 Call @ $1.27**    * **2 - $9 Call @ $1**    * **3 - $10 Call @ $0.88**    * **4 - $11 Call @ $0.69** * **3/19**    * **1 - $7 Call @ $1.97**    * **1 - $8 Call @ $2.05**    * **3 - $9 Call @ $1.85**    * **3 - $10 Call @ $1.55** * **8/20**     * **2 - $8 Calls @ $3.70**    * **20 - $9 Calls @ $2.89 avg** * **1/20/23**    * **1 - $7 call @ $4.10 avg**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2993558.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VfRtBmfwFcTxJHQm0t1D1OWjamIVa3hGlehK9qHxBqA.jpg|Microvision's Macrovision PT.

I've got quite the story to tell you all. Now, this isn't my story, but the story of a little company called Microvision (MVIS).  **Skip to the competition section for the smooth brain logic on why we will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**  **DISCLAIMER: AM AS RETARDED AS YOU ALL. I used every last brain cell I have to write this DD so we can all enjoy tendies once we moon** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 **POSITIONS AT BOTTOM**  &amp;#x200B;  **A LOT of this DD has been done by people that are way smarter than I over at** r/MVIS**. Those saints have an unreal DD that I will link** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/geaykw/dd_for_new_investors_crash_course_in_mvis/) **and a 'Best of MVIS' thread** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/hrihan/the_best_of_rmvis_meta_thread/)**. Most of us here don't know how to read so I will take that DD and make this as simple as possible. Here are some facts....**  &amp;#x200B;  # FACT - Microvision is best in class (LiDAR, MEMS, etc.)  This is another FACT. Microvisions LiDAR is the **BEST IN CLASS. See the image below for a comparison between the competition. This ALONE MEANS THEY ARE MASSIVELY UNDERVALUED.**  [Clearly, they are BEST IN CLASS](https://preview.redd.it/lxu36fbfvkd61.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e50c82625f426029bbec5b51b5076dd06d122ee)  From the chart above, clearly, they have the best LiDAR! **NOT ONLY ARE THE SPECS BETTER BUT THEIR A-SAMPLE IS GOING TO BE SHOWN OFF AROUND APRIL.** More than that, **THEY WILL BE READY FOR PRODUCTION GOING INTO THE FALL OF THIS YEAR!!** Which also makes them **FIRST TO MARKET** with a product like their LiDAR.  **TL:DR - MVIS IS BEST IN CLASS LIDAR** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  &amp;#x200B;  # FACT - Microvisions MEMS display hardware is used by Microsoft in the Hololens 2 and IVIS.  This isn't opinion, it is a simple fact. Those at Microvision and Microsoft will not actually acknowledge this fact, rumor is because they've been under an NDA for the last year or so. Every time either company is asked, they seem to deflect and name every other company like MVIS but not actually MVIS. WELL, u/s2upid over from r/MVIS decided to take matters into his own hands. This many dropped $3,000 last spring just so he could DESTROY the device and find those pesky MVIS chips inside. [Looks like he found what he was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/) This begs the question, why is this partnership so secretive? Well, the major rumor floating around right now is a **buyout from Microsoft.** Them being so secretive makes sense as MVIS has the best in class MEMS (and LiDAR), and it would make sense they don't want to get into a bidding war.  PS. Microsoft also has a US government contract to supply the military with modified Hololens 2s called IVIS which are purposely modified and geared toward military use and operations.   **US Gov contracts = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$**  **TL:DR - POTENTIAL MSFT BUYOUT**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  &amp;#x200B;  # FACT - Microvisions isn't only LiDAR and MEMS  The fact here is that MVIS has **FIVE** potential verticals they can sell!  * Display only devices * Interactive devices * NED devices * Consumer LiDAR * Auto LiDAR  I'm not sure how many of you can even read this many words in a year. Who the hell knows the potential of these verticals. Or what hardware is in each one. Or the cross-vertical applications of the hardware. My brain is short-circuiting even trying to think of words to think about this thought.  **TL:DR -** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  &amp;#x200B;  # Okay, this is getting long so let me wrap up with the most important point...  # MVIS Competition  So far the two main competitors for Microvisions LiDAR are looking like **Luminar (LAZR)** and **Velodyne (VLDR).

Any and all MVIS dips from this point forward need to be scooped by any means necessary. YOLO even applies here.

Oddly enough this 1st step required shareholders to actually APPROVE a reverse-split in order to avoid the reverse-split. Strategery. Again, this is advanced wsb retard stuff. If you do not understand what you are reading, please proceed to the rockets below.  *Stage 2: Regain $1 Compliance ✔️  Thanks in part to the shareholder vote, MVIS completed this 2nd stage on June 18th 2020 after announcing that former Google Augmented Reality OG, Mark Spitzer was added to their Board of Directors. https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-addition-dr-mark-b-spitzer-its-board  *Stage 3: Prevent potential bidders/buyers from waiting out MVIS' cash position. ✔️  MVIS completed this 3rd and final stage on Oct 8, 2020. More strategery here as shareholders were asked to whip out their 💎🍆 and slap the other side of the negotiating table's bidders/buyers in the face with them, by approving a 60m share authorization. MVIS can now survive until 2022 while they finish their LiDAR sensor due in April 2021.  https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iss-and-glass-lewis-recommend-approval-microvision-proxy  https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-third-quarter-2020-results  “MicroVision is focused on pursuing a strategic transaction at the right value for our shareholders.

This week it will go to $10 possibly touch $13.      This is a technical  analysis for anyone that is not a true autist. [TA Chart video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtofJkpJA0c)  I  keep about 1.5m in M V I S at this point and I was trying to be  responsible with the rest, but Monday I'll be plowing the 600 into GME  shares and 200 into BB shares.  Microvision is responsible for the important bits in Microsoft's Hololens 2. The  company is for sale and in talks with several Tier 1 companies. What is  more important about them is their amazing Lidar. Their specs are better  than Luminar and Velodyne and the sample will be out in April. They  have a shit-ton of patents. Their Lidar has longer range, light  rejection technology and better resolution. The modules are currently  about the size of VCR tape, getting smaller and will cost about $150.  This is way cheaper and smaller than the competitors all the true DD is at the subreddit.  **April is where the stock gets really hot**,  as soon as they strap one of those bad boys to a car, BOOM, LAZR type  valuations. If they weren't already a public R&amp;D company and they  could have had an IPO they probably would already be at these numbers.  The buyout price is rumored to be between 10 billion and 26 billion by most. That will be about $6.60 per billion per share **AKA $66-$170 per share.**  This stock has been heavily shorted, with hit pieces coming from Hindenburg and a few other trolls.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2026066.0|public|confidence|self|Witness my lady boner with a side of DD|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3l4rv/witness_my_lady_boner_with_a_side_of_dd/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||2021-01-23|MVIS

The fact of the matter is that one of Microsoft’s most important new products, and a research agreement with the United States Army, depends on Microvision technology.     The company's tech is critical to Microsoft's new product, if that isn't enough then how about:  \&gt; The idea here is simple. First, MVIS said that it is exploring strategic alternatives, including potential M&amp;A transactions. Around the same time, evidence emerged that Microsoft has taken over key component production and brought previous Microvision employees onto its team. With a vested interest in the technology and the fact that Microvision is struggling and cheap atthe moment, Microsoft stands to gain quite a bit by acquiring the company.     \- The stock is up 30% today and over 100% for the month institutions are buying the rumor, but calls are still dirt cheap, $6 is the max OTM call for 8/21 and they are literally $30.   \- Market cap is tiny (400M)    \- Earnings are out 7/29 (could be when they make the MFST announcement)     8/21 $6C, jump in before its too late.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1351635.0|public|confidence|self|MVIS DD - buy the (Microsoft) rumor|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hswlkc/mvis_dd_buy_the_microsoft_rumor/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||2020-07-17|MVIS

The company is most likely being bought out by Microsoft, but it’s possible another company like Amazon or Tesla could buy them. MicroVision sent Ford a HUD projection system prototype in the very early 2000s. Who knows what will happen. The stock has been crunched between .94 and 1.07 for several trading sessions.

Well, I give you the chance to buy your own airplane, like as example an A-12 (thanks Elon).  Yesterday, Sellas had a presentation for their shareholders on what medicines they are working.  Here is their presentation: [https://s22.q4cdn.com/485546146/files/doc\_presentations/2020/05/updated/SELLAS-Corporate-Overview-May-2020-Final3.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/485546146/files/doc_presentations/2020/05/updated/SELLAS-Corporate-Overview-May-2020-Final3.pdf)  I know you're not gonna read 27 slides, but just look at the charts. Their new drug GPS far exceeds in survival rate in comparison to historical comparators, even more than doubling their months of survival.  Watch my previous post for more theoretical explanation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk948y/sellas\_got\_2\_cancer\_vaccines\_incoming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk948y/sellas_got_2_cancer_vaccines_incoming/)  FAQ  Am I pumping Sellas?  \- Of course I am because I want my A-12  Am I pumping Sellas with good DD?  \- Of course I am because I don't want you guys to lose your Lambo  Why haven't I heard of Sellas before?  \- That's because we're before the hypetrain. Stock Manipulation by shorters cuz of low volume in the past. Steady uptrend which is growing exponentially since last month.  But it already mooned 100%?  \- Yeah and it will hit at least $10, because Market Cap is way undervalued. They are going to get a buy-out soon.  TL;DR: Sellas will hit $4 this week. MARK MY F\*CKING WORDS. Ask yourself this question: Do I wanna get fucked by the big institutions, who hype stocks like UAVS and MVIS, and buy at the top?  No, buy the dip you faggot|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1204816.0|public|confidence|self|DD on Sellas: Jump in before the hypetrain|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmo4m9/dd_on_sellas_jump_in_before_the_hypetrain/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||2020-05-19|MVIS

However, with no news out, many investors are scratching their heads, wondering what’s going on.

CALLING ALL NEWFAGS AND NORMIES.   If you can’t read, GFY now.   Now that we will be on the popular section of reddit, this has become pertinent. WSB can't avoid newcomers, so we might as well explain how the clock ticks here. This one is for you r/all.   This is to serve as a reference what values we hold, what instruments we use, and as a general place to educated the uneducated.  First off, this is the LEAST helpful stock market-based community for newcomers. Sarcastic answers are the only thing of true value here. It isn't a place to learn, but a place to plan out where you will dock your yacht. Newcomers are usually berated upon asking the inevitable stupid questions that they could learn slowly from reading here, or just using a damn search engine. Instead of embarrassing yourself here, you now have the opportunity to read this and get what we’re all rambling about.   This will help you understand what to expect if you make the decision to undertake a WSB style trading career, so you can stay here and contribute to the yolo lifestyle or otherwise GFY.   I will edit in any suggestions that our frequenting users or mods want to add to this as well.  To begin: Here are our topics for *WSB101*   **-Basics (Equities/Stocks)**  ;  **-ETF's**  ;  **-Options**  ;  **-Futures Trading**  ;  **-SubCulture**    ;       **BASICS/EQUTIES** Skip if you understand basic stock stuff  Okay, so what is an equity/stock? An equity is essentially what you’d think of as your “vanilla” trading tool. They move up or down depending on market forces, and can range from pennies to thousands of dollars per share. To explain how stocks work, let's define a few terms.    **Volume:** The number of shares of stock traded during a particular time period, normally measured in average daily trading volume.  **Spread:** The difference between the bid and the ask price  **Bid Price:** The current price in which someone wants to buy at  **Ask Price:**The current price in which someone wants to sell at  **Volatility:** The WSB favorite. Volatility is referring to the price movements of a stock as a whole. The higher the volatility, the more the stock is moving up or down. Highly volatile stocks are ones with extreme daily up and down movements and wide intraday trading ranges.   **Margin:** A margin account lets a person borrow money (take out a loan essentially) from a broker to purchase an investment. The difference between the amount of the loan, and the price of the securities, is called the margin. Margin is one of WSB’s popular instruments of wealth and destruction.  **Dividend:** This is a portion of a company’s earnings that is paid to shareholders, or people that own hat company’s stock, on a quarterly or annual basis. Not all companies do this.  **PPS:** Acronym for “Price per Share”  **Moving Average:** A stock’s average price-per-share during a specific period of time.   **Bullish:** Expecting the stock to go up  **Bearish:** Expecting the stock to go down  Any raised hands can redirect themselves to here:  http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082614/how-stock-market-works.asp?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186    Now that these terms are defined, let's move into the details of why this is even useful. Most people know what a stock is, but how and why stocks move is a different story. The stock market is essentially a big virtualization of supply and demand - meaning that usually high positive volume creates upwards movement in the PPS, where high negative volume does the opposite. This creates a trader’s opportunity; Generally, the most effective time to buy or sell is where the candlesticks (volume data) are thinning out. When you are ready to take an entry point or execute an exit point, waiting till the volatility (candlesticks) thin out is one method to give you best trade possible.    **WSB FAVORITE EQUITIES:** Of many equities, WSB favors the riskier ones - but avoiding penny stocks is a policy.   AMD - CEO Lisa Su, Next Gen Processors, chips, graphics. It’s the gamers gambit. Up roughly 1400% as of 2/7/2017 since WSB first mentioned it   NVDA - AMD’s sister? Mother? Daddy? Who knows. NVDA has been a sexy semiconductor leader. Is up 400% since gaining traction on WSB.    FNMA / pfds - Mnunchin, Trump, Big fat fannies. Get your self deep in the fannie. We all want it. WSB 10 bagger candidate for reforming the housing market. WSB holds a large cumulative position that can be seen below. Also a good read is the beginners guide to FNMA. Any post by u/NOVACPA is very often VERY informative on FMNA/pfds.   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5oissp/results_wsb_fnmafmcc_holdings  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5t7gba/beginngers_guide_to_fnma_fmcc_read_this_before/    ARRY - A biotech champion that prevailed after a lot of failures and huge losses in the biotech sector. Dark times for WSB. Up ~300% since getting traction on the subreddit.   TWTR - WSB likes to buy put option contracts on her. Exemplary of a social media platform that is unable to monetize itself.   TSLA - Maybe not unanimously a favorite, but loved for it’s sexy volatility, Elon Musk, and ridiculously expensive options.  GILD - A Shkreli pump and dump? The greatest large cap pharma recovery of all time? Who knows. Martin took the time to make a post on this reddit and it is up $5 dollars since.    **ETF'S**   Welcome to the world of investing made easy. Exchange traded funds (etfs) are devices that can be traded like stocks, but often track the value of many companies by investing in their listed assets accordingly. Specifically, An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold. ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.   ETF’s come in beautiful and delicious varieties, often with a BEAR form and a BULL form of each; but the most delicious to WSB are the 3x etf’s. A 3x ETF is one in which the underlying movement of the ETF is leveraged 3:1. Meaning for every movement within the underlying index or stocks, the 3x ETF moves well.... 3x as much..   **WSB FAVORITE AND USEFUL ETF’S:**    JNUG - 3x Gold Miner Bull - A hit or miss, has extreme intraday movements and essentially tracks GDX (gold miner’s index). Jnug will usually move with a pretty strong correlation to gold, which is affected by the mentioning of rate hikes (negatively), movement of the US dollar (inversely), uncertainty (positively), and supply and demand.    NUGT - Jnug with a different price tag   JDST - The inverse 3x etf of JNUG - or the bear etf. It does almost exactly the opposite movements of JNUG by the tick. Moves for the same reasons, but obviously opposite directions.   DUST - Jdst with a different price tag.   UGAZ - Natural Gas 3x Bull ETF - essentially tracks the price value of the commodity Natural Gas, but more specifically the S&amp;P GSCI Natural Gas Index ER. The index comprises futures contracts on a single commodity and is calculated according to the methodology of the S&amp;P GSCI Index. Natural gas is most affected by Weather temperature conditions (use your brain), petroleum prices, and broader economic conditions.   DGAZ - Inverse of UGAZ   UWT - Crude Oil Bull 3x ETF - extreme intraday movements, closely follows the price of oil. More specifically, it tracks futures. UWT seeks to replicate, net of expenses, three times of the S&amp;P GSCI® Crude Oil Index ER. The index tracks a hypothetical position in the nearest-to-expiration NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures contract, which is rolled each month into the futures contract expiring in the next month. The value of the index fluctuates with changes in the price of the relevant NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures contracts.   DWT - Inverse of UWT   FAS - Financial Bull, specifically FAS seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the performance of the Russell 1000 ® Financial Services Index. The fund creates long positions by investing at least 80% of its assets in the securities that comprise the Russell 1000 ® Financial Services Index and/or financial instruments that provide leveraged and unleveraged exposure to the index. Can be used when bullish on US financial services - so banks, lenders, etc.   FAZ - Inverse of FAS   UPRO - S&amp;P500 Bull 3x ETF, essentially tracks the S&amp;P500 and multiplies it’s returns by 3x.   BRZU - Tracks Brazil (in its most basic form). It creates long positions in the MSCI Brazil 25/50 Index.   LABU - Tracks the Biotech sector, or specifically 300% of the performance of the S&amp;P Biotechnology Select  Industry Index (""index""). It should be noted that LABU has doubled since just before the election of Donald Trump.   LABD - Inverse of LABU   RUSL - roughly creates 300% of the performance of the MVIS Russia Index.   RUSS - Inverse of RUSL   SPY - Tracks the S&amp;P500, but is not 3x.     **OPTIONS:**  Alright, so half you are going to understand this, and half of you are not. Pull up an options chain now on any stock (penny stocks and specific stocks do not have chains because of their market cap). Options are truly the ultimate way to achieve maximum risk/reward.   An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price, on a certain date. This concept makes options a commodity themselves.    KEY TERMS:   A CALL - is the right to buy. Buying calls is taking a bullish position in its most extreme form.   A PUT - is the right to sell.   The underlying - is the stock that the option is covering i.e. AAPL, GOOG, AMZN   Strike Price - the price at which a put or call option can be exercised.   ITM, In the money - In the money means that a call option's strike price is below the market price of the underlying asset or that the strike price of a put option is above the market price of the underlying asset. Being in the money does not mean you will profit, it just means the option is worth exercising.   OTM, Out of the money - a call option with a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset, or a put option with a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset.   ATM - At the money - Strike price at the same price as the underlying   Expiration - Expiries for options are every friday of every week usually, with exceptions such as every month, or every other day - depending on the underlying. SPY and SPX are great examples of very active option chains with expiries every other day. On the expiry date or any time before (with american options), an option can be, but doesn’t have to be exercised, meaning the holder of the option can use it to buy or sell shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. Most people on WSB do not exercise the contracts, but merely flip them for increases in value as the underlying moves.   For example, when AAPL was at 120 before its earnings report, Joe Shmoe Yolo buys 10 FEB 17th CALLS at strike 127 for .60 , each. Now .60 cents is really 60 dollars each, because the contract is multiplied by 100 (the right to 100 shares). In total, Joe Shmoe Yolo spends $600 dollars + commision on this trade. The next day, AAPL leaps to 130 upon great news. These same option contracts are now worth 3.50 each. $350 dollars per contract, times ten contracts is $3500 dollars. Joe Shmoe Yolo just turned $600 into $3500 dollars. MAGIC. Spoiler alert: Joe Shmoe Yolo was me.   That same Joe Shmoe later buys FEB 17th XOM calls at 90, hoping for similar results. However, XOM ends up never reaching anywhere close to the strike price, and the options expire worthless. Get it?   Now what determines the pricing of options?    OPTION PRICING:   Below is sourced from investopedia   Intrinsic Value: The intrinsic value is the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, in terms of both tangible and intangible factors. This value may or may not be the same as the current market value. Additionally, intrinsic value is primarily used in options pricing to indicate the amount an option is in the money.   Time Value: Time Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value. The more time an option has until it expires, the greater the chance it will end up in the money. The time component of an option decays exponentially. The actual derivation of the time value of an option is a fairly complex equation. As a general rule, an option will lose one-third of its value during the first half of its life and two-thirds during the second half of its life. This is an important concept for securities investors because the closer you get to expiration, the more of a move in the underlying security is needed to impact the price of the option. Time value is basically the risk premium that the option seller requires to provide the option buyer the right to buy/sell the stock up to the date the option expires. It is like an insurance premium of the option; the higher the risk, the higher the cost to buy the option. Makes sense, right?   Time value is determined by the expiration date.  An expiration date in derivatives is the last day that an options contract is valid. When investors buy options, the contracts gives them the right but not the obligation, to buy or sell the assets at a predetermined price, called a strike price, within a given time period, which is on or before the expiration date. If an investor chooses not to exercise that right, the option expires and becomes worthless, and the investor loses the money paid to buy it.   *Volatility:*  In an options pricing, you see IV. This stands for implied volatility. The higher that is, the higher the options will be priced Volatility is the extent to which the return of the underlying asset will fluctuate between now and the option's expiration. Volatility, as expressed as a percentage coefficient within option-pricing formulas, arises from daily trading activities. How volatility is measured will affect the value of the coefficient used.    *Decaying Nature of Options:*  Decay refers to derivative trading (i.e. options). When you sell or buy a call/put (using those two for simplicity purposes) you don't get an infinite time frame to make your dreams come true. Time is your enemy; the further out the expiration date, the less time decay there is. Time decay really hits the worst the week of expiration. Sound confusing? Say you're buying options of the stock WSB (I hope you're seeing what I did there) - and the option costs $1, the expiration is this Friday. Say today is Monday. You buy a call expecting WSB to take you to the moon and beyond. Each day the stock doesn't move closer to your strike price or remains stagnant/drops, you lose value on your option + the time decay. Meaning if it finishes closer to your strike price, your option could be worthless because of that time decay. Questions? Ask away.    A great example of these factors in action is TSLA.  TSLA’s options are among the most expensive for companies in its price range, why?  An in the money TSLA call expiring this week is worth around $1100 per contract. Insanely expensive. But for a reason. TSLA has extreme intraday movements and calls have an implied volatility of 40.92%. Which is fairly high. In addition to that, it holds high intrinsic value / price per share, and a week of time value.   **-Futures 101 - The Ultimate YOLO Guide** (thanks to u/IncendiaryGames)  Okay, a lot of you have been YOLOing on faggot delights on SPY options. How would you like to trade something with the same or more leverage, 1.0 delta, and no time premium costs? Have you considered futures? What are futures? Unlike options, futures is a contract where both the buyer and seller is obligated to perform the transaction by the expiration. Conversely, in options, only the seller is obligated to perform. That means you can lose more than your investment. Originally they were used by farmers to sell future crops early and guarantee some amount of sales. Since then futures have expanded not just to commodities but currency and equity indices like the S&amp;P 500. Why the heck would I want to trade futures? Here are the advantages: Leverage $5k is the margin requirement for most contracts. For example with the E-mini S&amp;P 500 with 5k you're trading $120k worth of stuff. 1 contract = 500 spy shares. Some brokers offer intraday daytrading margin rates too - TD Ameritrade is 25% of the overnight margin rate($1,250.) Some brokers go as low as $500 an /ES future. SPAN Margin If 24x overnight leverage and 240x day trade leverage didn't give you a hard on there is also SPAN margin, which is like portfolio margin on steroids. The beauty of SPAN margin is you don't need a $125k+ account to be eligible. SPAN will greatly reduce your margin requirements if you hold uncorrelated or inversely correlated positions (up to an 80% discount, here is a list of groups that give discounts) and if you hedge with options. Hedge with the right option or asset and now you have up to 500x day trading margin. 23/7 and day trading Ever get in and out of an equity only to have your broker yell at you to stop doing that or deposit $25k? There is no pattern day trading restrictions on futures. Feel free to day trade and blow up your account as often as you want! You can also trade 23 hours a day. Get trading on how the S&amp;P 500 index will react to news from China right away. Taxes No matter how long or how short you hold you always get taxed under the 60/40 rule. 60% of your profit from futures will be taxed as a long term gain and 40% will be taxed as short term gain. No wash sales. Trade your hearts out. Just remember holding past Dec 31st will treat you as if you closed all your positions that day and you'll be taxed on unrealized gains. Long/Short No need to pay interest or borrow shares as being short a future contract is being a writer, just like an options writer. Options Of course there are options. What fun would it be without options? Unlike stock options each contract gives different number of future contracts. Research what you're trading.   Ok. I'm convinced. I want to strat trading futures! What are some good strategies?   YOLO Strategies  Swing trading Trying to guess/predict/ride sudden market momentum. A low volume average day in the S&amp;P 500 (/ES) for one contract can swing +- $500. Get it right and you can see a huge appreciation of value. /ES is usually highly liquid during regular hours with average volume of 1 million trades and usually bid-ask spreads of one tick. One approach is to buy or short in your direction and put in a stop loss to an amount you're comfortable to lose (say $200.) Since it's so liquid you'll likely be filled at or near your stop loss during the day if your trade goes against you. If you can guess the direction 50% of the time and have trades like this: trade 1 - gain $800 trade 2 - lose $200 Then you may profit over the time period. If you have a 50% chance of being wrong and losing $200 or 50% chance of being right and gaining $800 then over time you'll gain more than you lose. Also, since the present value of your futures contract is included in your margin calculation then if it goes strongly in your favor your position can quickly grow to cover its own margin and you can let it ride for a while. You'll want to be sure you enter a combo buy/short order along with a stop loss order simultaneously, like this for Thinkorswim. Futures can move suddenly and a sudden movement can make you lose a ton of money. Exploiting outdated SPAN margin guidelines There are several out of date correlations between popular futures like oil and say things like wheat that SPAN gives you margin credits on. Take whatever position you want in oil (/cl) then take the opposite in something that doesn't move much day to day with less volatility such as /w (wheat)) and your /cl and /w positions will get a 75% credit, giving you 50% more buying power on crude oil. (2 positions * .25 = 0.5). Trade your heart out on the more volatile future then when you're done close your safer future pair. SPAN is constantly changing but such a complex system definitely has its exploits. Automated/algorithmic trading For you programmer geeks out there it's really hard to algorithmic trade on small accounts due to pattern day trading rules and economies of scale with broker fees. Futures is probably the best way to get your feet wet. Join us on /r/algotrading if you want to explore more!   Boring safer strategies  I'm including these for completeness but these belong on /r/investing. Scalping With high frequency trading scalping is less guaranteed. Basically scalping is using tiny momentum as usually there are small micro patterns in futures buying and selling activity where it will rise or fall a couple of ticks. Since the notional value of each tick is $12.5 it's profitable for retail investors and small accounts to act as a market maker after fees at the smallest bid-ask spread possible. Spreads Just like you can trade spreads in options, you can trade calendar spreads in futures. Futures have contracts with different expiration dates and the prices are different for each month of expiration based on the market's expectations. You can go long or short the near month expiration and the opposite for the far month. This will hedge out any sudden market moves as that would likely affect both months. Bull markets in general tend to increase the price of the near month faster than the far month. Basically with a spread trade you're making a long term bet on bull or bear for the underlying future. Pairs trading You can go long in one future say the dow jones (/ym) and short the S&amp;P 500 index and profit off the relative growth. This is a hedged trade as any market ups or downs will likely affect both positions with the same % value. For the past 180 days /ym - /es has been really profitable. Even if you don't do a full perfect pairs trade it is still a great option to reduce the leverage too on whatever index future you're trading so you can stay in longer or overnight. Interest rate and optimal leverage plays Since the $5k investment is equal to $120k of the S&amp;P 500 index currently then you'll likely beat out the market by buying one future contract and putting $115k in safe treasuries or bonds or uncorrelated assets. Some people choose to leverage their stock portfolio and you can get the exact leverage ratio of liquid investments to future ratios. In probability theory the max leverage you can gain is determined by the Kelly Criterion which modeling shows indicates the S&amp;P 500 index to be leveraged to 1.40x. Yes, you could do the same with options but even on SPY deep in the money call leaps are illiquid and have a time premium. Even today they are so deep ITM that the options you would need to use have 0 open interest and a bid-ask spread of $5 per share (so $500 per contract.) You'd need ~5 contracts per 120k so you're already eating $2.5k/$120k - 2% interest rate a year for that leverage. SPX isn't better, it's bid ask is 22 so you'd be eating $2.2k/$120k - 1.83% interest rate. It's doubtful you won't get much past the ask as its only market makers providing liquidity and guess what the market maker will do if you buy/sell the option? They will hedge with the underlying futures until their minimum profit is the risk free interest rate. Hedging Going long and short in various non correlated or negatively correlated assets to seek out a high sharpe ratio and have a higher risk free return that is market neutral. Basic hedge fund stuff. The variety and price efficiency of futures makes things pretty attractive in this area.   **SUBCULTURE**      Wallstreetbets is a community that has become infamous for the most wild west, moon or cardboard box trades on the planet earth. WSB is a place where you can take out thousand dollar loans, refinance your homes, cash advance all of your credit cards only to put it all on JNUG, and we will still love you. Your mother won't. Your father will never understand your spectrum of autism, but we will always love you. It is a uniquely beautiful community focused on praising its biggest losers as much as its biggest winners. To begin on the subculture, we should define some key moments in the sub's history.   HISTORY: (As made by u/digadiga) + my additions   2012: /u/Jartek [+1] creates /r/wallstreetbets, and word slowly starts to ooze out. 2013: /u/americanpegasus discovers pennies. AP has seen the light, and is a penny stock evangelist. Jartek &amp; AP have an epic options vs pennies battle - they both lose a couple of hundred bucks, but we are entertained, and WSB is officially born. AP blows up his retirement, swears off pennies and moves onto bitcoins. 2014: /u/fscomeau [+3] discovers options. He repeatedly bets five figures on AAPL calls before earnings. FS claims a supernatural clairvoyance of AAPL. FS then posts about his chest pains and ER visits. He finally suffers an epic loss. Is he dead? Is he alive? Is he is mother? Is he banned? Who cares? 2015: Photos from the 3rd annual meetup are posted. Where a bunch of dudes hang out on the romantic beaches of Guerrero Mexico. In a completely unrelated event, the wsb banner is changed to thousands of ejaculating dicks. Modpocalypse occurs. Hundreds of random users are added as moderators for a few months. None of the new mods can change the CSS. The constant whining about how ""wsb isn't what it used to be"" continues. Someone attempts to show how selling covered calls is idiot proof, but gets lazy, bets all six figures on Apple, and suffers significant losses. Robinhood gets popular. Should you buy one share of AMZN or one share of GOOGL? Who gives a fuck. 2016: Everyone starts saying ""go fuck yourself."" Except me. Because I am what I am. And if you don't like it, you can all go fuck yourselves. u/World_Chaos performs one of the more impressive yolo's of the sub, starting with 900 dollars, and turning it into 55k. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/414blh/yofuckinglo_900_to_55k_in_12_days/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link 2017: u/fscomeau preforms what he calls ""The Final Yolo"", a 300k trade against AAPL before earnings (that I, u/thor303456 inversed), supposedly supposed to net fscomeau 2.5 million or so, in which he will finally stop trading. FSC is featured on several market related articles and newspapers, showing up on yahoo, etc. Later we find proof during his livestream of AAPL earnings that he was paper trading. Even later, FSC writes a near 200 page book called ""Wolfie Has Fallen"" describing how he trolled the entire internet, some following him into that AAPL trade. Martin Shkreli visits the sub and proclaims that GILD pharma is worth over $100 a share and is deeply undervalued.       KEY FIGURES:   **Donald J Trump** - He is the Marmalade Manchurian, the Tangerine Tycoon, and our spray tan Stalin. Unbelievable night of election. WSB demographics show a primarily capitalist and right wing (or at least joking to be so) point of view, and thus we are generally pro trump. In actuality though, WSB is focused on *pro-market*, which Trump happens to be.   **u/Jartek** - Founder of the sub, original yoloer. Believe he has retired from reddit for the most part. Mostly inactive.   **u/Fscomeau** - The Canadian as some call him, and perhaps one of the most profound internet trolls of 2016-2017. A French-Canadian trader who deals with mostly options. The man has been called ""The Great Inverse"", and for a good reason. Nearly all of the trades or statements he made on WSB were completely wrong or mostly wrong. Truly the strongest technical indicator.   **Martin Shkreli** - An idol to many WSBers, Martin stands as the master of the biotech sector. A very debated character for very stupid reasons. Martin regularly tweets about the stock market, occasionally does a youtube channel, and livestreams fairly regularly.   **u/theycallme1** - Educated trader, and mod of WSB. Roasts people often and roasts them good. Ask him the questions that aren't stupid. One of the most active mods.   **u/world_chaos** - some fucking college student with some real net worth. Sits on 100k or so (needs verification), and was an inspiring yoloer to all, with his 900 to 55k yolo with options.   *Lingo, Terminology, and Nomenclature:*    The Faggots Delights - Truly the most suicidal, yet clearest shot to the moon. This term is usually used to define either weekly, or daily option plays on the SPY/SPX. Some users trade them very profitably, such as u/MRPguy  and many in the past.    Cuck - Truly the worst thing you could be. A cuck is a man who likes watching his wife/girlfriend fuck other guys. Weak, spineless, and a term often throw around here.   The YOLO - You only live once. This is something that is, and should be realized as undeniably true. Why are you sitting on a 5k emergency fund that is making you less interest in a year than what I just made in 10 minutes? Why haven't you used all of the credit on your 5 credit cards or used your testicles as collateral for a loan yet? YOLO or YOLOING is as much a psychological decision to embrace absurdism, and win with everything you have while risking it all. Yolo is what it means to be a WSB trader.   Bagholding or a Bagholder - When you're stuck with the most ass trade of your life, because you know it'll go back up. A bagholder is the 59 year old guy at the grocery store who won't quit his Job because he knows he only has to wait another year until he gets a return on his investment  (of his life). Anyone holding SUNEQ is the definition of a bagholder.    Autists - Something we embrace, something we call each other, something we all are. Autism isn't used in an offensive way as much as it is a generally accepted term that defines us. The best traders have autism because of their distance from emotion. I bet you never made it to this part of the reading because you're such a damn autist.   Tendies - Tendies are what you get after you make a small amount of money. ""I SOLD AMD TODAY FOR A $13 DOLLAR PROFIT, GOING TO MCD's TO GET MY TENDIES"". Tendie money is usually shameful and insignificant, but at least it got you tendies. Chicken tenders at McDonalds are the least expensive for the most cholesterol.  I know some of the writing was half ass, full of errors, or otherwise not the best explanation. But I believe this will serve its purpose, and maybe help to promote new ideas from moderately educated traders. WSB has very strong traders, and the most uniquely risky trading styles on the planet. Hopefully this can serve to better the overall community.  You guys are all faggots, upvote this so we can get the noobs to stop trying to bite on our cocks.   Also I'd really appreciate input on anything to add to this overall. It took my over 3 hours to write up, so I eventually grew tired and probably have missing spots.      Enjoy your time here at WSB.    EDIT: Added a shit ton of stuff, fixed errors. THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR INPUT, ACTUALLY MAKING WSB GREAT AGAIN  MODS: Can we make this editable by others mods or something? My fingers aren't enough. Seems like this could serve as a good ""official"" thing.

You cannot look at one single index or item to trade JNUG. See list of charts at bottom**  #I am writing this post to answer the multiple questions this sub sees on a regular basis in regards to the leveraged ETF's NUGT/JNUG &amp; DUST/JDST.   [JNUG on Yahoo Finance for those living under a rock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNUG?p=JNUG).   #For your information **JNUG**:  &gt;The investment seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of **300% of the performance of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index**. The fund creates long positions by investing at least 80% of its assets in the securities that comprise the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index and/or financial instruments that provide leveraged and unleveraged exposure to the index. It is non-diversified.  So what does that mean? **It means that whatever the symbol GDXJ does JNUG will make the same move, but it will be exaggerated**. I'm not here to tell you about how its balanced and decay and whatnot, just don't bag hold this shit. Now we need to figure out what makes GDXJ tick, because it is the underlying security moving JNUG. GDXJ is an ETF made up of gold mining companies.   &gt;The index includes companies that generate at least 50% of their revenues from (or, in certain circumstances, have at least 50% of their assets related to) gold mining and/or silver mining/royalties/streaming or have mining projects with the potential to generate at least 50% of their revenues from gold and/or silver when developed.   #So now we want to think about what makes gold mining companies tick.   People change their sentiment on mining companies with a close correlation to whatever commodity the company sells. It's like oil companies and their relation to crude oil prices. Perception is often more important than what should happen. When people see gold go up, they buy gold miners even if the gold mining companies will see little to no change with minuscule movements in the commodity.  #**Everything is connected.**   The bond market is far bigger than the stock market. [Bonds are being sold in record numbers](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN13D2IP?client=safari) after the Trump election, creating a massive increase in yields. As people sell their bonds they are not sitting on their cash, the money is moving into stocks and generally riskier assets. As this happens the safe-haven value of gold is decreasing. Combine this with the record high dollar strength compared to other currencies and gold looks far less attractive as an investment in the near term. Gold still has a lot of value as an investment but in the short term it likely has further to drop before it climbs again. (That's just my personal opinion, don't crucify me if I'm wrong).  Below are a series of charts to compare different asset classes with gold.   First of all:    - GDXJ versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/m7Q0GOWE/    - Basically a direct relationship, even with small shifts in the price of gold causing movement in GDXJ.  Next, asset relations to Gold:   - Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/XtYn9kuz/   - 30-yr treasury yield versus Gold    - https://www.tradingview.com/x/EsUvaH2b/    - Inversely related. Bond yields go up when their prices go down, so as people sell their bonds and flood the market yields go up and gold goes down.   - Treasury Bond Futures Index versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q5PqHf92/   - Crude Oil futures versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/YgVNOduz/   - S&amp;P500 versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/mRp8PhlP/   - US Dollar index versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/iMI96qjA/   - VIX Volatility Index versus Gold   - https://www.tradingview.com/x/lvhFZP0Z/  ##**Now what happened over the last few weeks that drove gold to this dramatic plunge?**  Lets see another chart.    - https://www.tradingview.com/x/PdgxQb0j/   The red box is immediately after the election, see how immediately after we have a massive selloff in bonds? (Price inverse to yield, chart shows yield shooting up). With Trump winning the election the market became extremely bullish on future economic output and the general business environment. Whether this is warranted or not is not the point, the point is that it is the current market sentiment. Think opposite Brexit. Brexit was a flight to safety (gold shot up immediately) so it stands to reason that gold has plummeted in the election aftermath.  #In summation: Trump victory kicked off surge in bullish sentiment and expectations of future economic growth, which helped spur a massive selloff in bonds, which helped drive the dollar higher and funneled money into other asset classes, next thing you know gold is down and JNUG is fucked.  As I come across any helpful reading I'll paste them down here.    - Credit to /u/AnalxBeads   &gt;I think you should add a section about premiums and discounts and how a market maker/authorized participant makes sure these ETF's stay closer to the NAV. And how at certain points people can lose more then they thought because they bought at a premium. Although with the liquity of JNUG its almost nill. Still, some people think other factors like demand have large affect in ETF's  [Prospectus (not that you fags will read it)](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//JNUG/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus)  [Info on premium/discount and net asset value](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//JNUG/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus)   - The transaction prices for shares are based on current market supply and demand and may be higher (premium) or lower (discount) than the net asset value per share of the fund.   - As such, shareholders may pay more than net asset value when purchasing fund shares and receive less than net asset value when redeeming those shares.||False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|[DD] Inter-market Analysis: Understanding JNUG||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5elpu6/dd_intermarket_analysis_understanding_jnug/||||||||0.0|1431438545.0||1479971247.0|{}|{}|2016-11-24|MVIS

The index tracks the performance of micro-, small- and mid-capitalization companies in the global gold and silver mining industry, as identified by the index provider. The fund is non-diversified.

The index they use to pick the mines comes from MVIS and the list of mines are here:   http://www.mvis-indices.com/indices/hard-asset/mvis-global-junior-gold-miners/components  I think it's important to note that this stock is never leveraged directly with gold.   Moves are made within the JNUG, that's part management fee's. these next 2 pictures have the top ""holdings"" in them and you can see they are different within 2 weeks.  Jnug 2 weeks ago   http://imgur.com/QFklKCp  JNUG today  http://imgur.com/uuAJsNm  The whole point is, it does follow gold in a way but not exactly how people picture it.  To simplify this and explain, this is a time vs percentage change graph . I compare JNUG, UGLD(another x3 31 year long) and GLD, goes back 3 months.  http://imgur.com/0DEEKSY  TLDR/Conclussion –  JNUG does not invest in gold but because of what it's leveraged against it does follow gold trends and because of the way it invest it actually makes larger percentage swings as compared to etf's invested directly into the gold bullion even x3 leveraged ones.
