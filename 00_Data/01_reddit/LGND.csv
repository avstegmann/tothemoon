I have decided to provide a mid-week update. To do this, I took the most recent closing price and subtracted it from the next closing price. So if a company reported earnings in the morning, I took the closing price from the day before, and the closing price from the day the earnings was reported, and converted into a daily change (which will be shown in the chart as well). With out further delay, here are the current results:  Date|Ticker|% Short|DTC|Beat EPS|Beat rev|% Change  -----|-----|-----|-----|---------|---------|---------  2/1|ON|8.49|4.302096178|Yes|Yes|6.34% 2/2|HOG|11.9|10.30508475|No|No|-16.71% 2/2|MPC|5.39|5.912310287|Yes|Yes|3.91% 2/2|SALT|6.94|5.619991505|No|Yes|10.13% 2/2|LITE|8.62|3.365979381|Yes|No|-8.20% 2/2|LFVN|5.09|7.007714561|Yes|No|-0.44% 2/2|FEYE|7.83|3.217162872|Yes|Yes|-7.51% 2/3|LGND|62.24|4.882926829|Yes|yes|0.01% 2/3|CHKP|7.76|6.668711656|yes|yes|-10.48% 2/3|TTMI|12.62|12.03571429|Yes|Yes|**2.71% 2/3|GRUB|15.58|12.24576271|No|No|**-4.40%  ** These two are too early to tell the official outcome, but as of the time of writing both had reported earnings, and that was their current price change.

everyone, I know you retards are all holding GME as hard as your anal sphincters allow, but don't forget GME is still shit and you have to let it go at some point. I recommend you do it tomorrow at the open and grab LGND stock instead and here is why:  We always need a good reason for why we're investing. For the many who started sub $100 price point on GME, it was mostly because the short interest was through the roof at 140% when GME was at $5. That's fucking ridiculous. Because of that, there was strong potential for a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze even happened 1/22. Big applause to the retards who won that and drove the price of GME past $100.  Here is an example:  Melvin Capital closed their shorts on 1/26 when GME was at $148. If they were shorting since at least the start of January when it was at $17, then they lost $17 sold - $148 bought = $131 for each shorted stock they had. They bought at 148/17 = 8.7X how much they sold the stock for.  Ultimately, they motivated short holders to cover their position at a fat loss. However, shares short as a percentage of float still remained dummy high the same week. Why? Because new shorts came at higher price points of GME stock ($300+) than before. For those hedge fund institutions to be incentivized to cover their newer short position, GME would need to keep skyrocketing, at least into the $500 range to put pressure on their shorts at $300, and that isn't even 2x how much they sold the stock for. Remember, about 9X is when Melcin Capital finally threw in the towel.  If it does go that high and institutions do sell though, then they could  further carry it into who knows, maybe 1k+ where the moon awaits. Ok so if you're holding, goal is to get the stock to $500+ so that a short squeeze can happen. Remember, getting it to $500 won't happen because of a short squeeze.  This means that initial jump into a solid $500 stock price would need to be made mostly by retail investors, of which, have already invested into GME. Literally the WHOLE WORLD is on this boat including Europe and even China. Listen, if the hype was real enough to get global attention, that's the peak man! You're not gonna find more retail investors to jump onto the GME ship to carry it to $500+, there just isn't any more people. So, I don't think retail investors have the remaining capital to keep boosting GME stock price because its peaked its hype.  Still thinking GME has dummy high short interest and you don't care about what i've just said? Think again, more than half the shorts were covered Friday  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1vjhmhbcixe61.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebdee3c6797eb0d2941d98f2991c29ce009e983  What does this mean? If capital is all tied up and gme isn't moving up, people will sell. If they sell, you already know what that means... its over.  So to save my tendies and maybe yours, I'll be the first to say I sold my GME stock and moved it all into LGND. Wtf is LGND? Fuck if i know. But I do know (as far as my research goes) they're now THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED COMPANY.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/g1bke9kgixe61.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59909847a2ed8cba0924a8ff22b40d7d9ee23fb3  This was the whole reason why GME was a gem to begin with and it happened, that bitch mooned because we like the stock. But without the short position to help keep it bolstered, it doesn't have support like LGND does. The short position on LGND is at a super high 65% and most of those are from a month ago or before when the stock price was half. THIS MEANS THE SHORTS ARE PRIMED TO BE COVERED ALREADY! HOP THE FUCK IN BOYS. Positions = buy the damn stock.  TLDR; GME is dying. I like LGND stock better  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: üöÄLGNDüöÄ  To the many of you still thinking GME shorts are high AF and over 100%, thats because the information you're getting IS NOT UP TO DATE. The stock exchanges releases short interest data once every two weeks for the public to see. I paid to see data daily. GME short interest has declined sharply because shorts were covered. Here is a link to an article with a different graph than mine, same conclusion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)  &amp;#x200B;  Second edit: for anyone that listened, congrats you saved yourself from getting fucked by after hours on GME|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8542434.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TDLQpVLH0wn2muVFfdxNMoco0GdeNZzjts2pXoYISAQ.jpg|GME rest in peace.

today's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we‚Äôll be going over over the details about what happened this week with GME, the drama around Robinhood and other brokers, and take a close look at some data to determine whether or not GME and other various meme / high SI stocks such as AMC, BBBY, FIZZ, LGND, and ~~BB~~ will continue üöÄüöÄüöÄin its short squeeze this week, and how this all could lead to widespread stock market crash and financial crisis. But first, something to cover my ass for the SEC investigators combing through this Subreddit  Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.  ## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?  There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I‚Äôll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reason given by Robinhood.  [**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)  This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn‚Äôt believe the Sequoia part since I don‚Äôt really know what they would gain from it - they‚Äôre a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I‚Äôd be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop‚Äôs short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I‚Äôll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it‚Äôs actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn‚Äôt happen in the first month in office.  **Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**  This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don‚Äôt know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood‚Äôs sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).  Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There‚Äôs also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn‚Äôt invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.  **The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**  Let‚Äôs get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren‚Äôt able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren‚Äôt able to trade through them. Let‚Äôs dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.  Let‚Äôs talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There‚Äôs a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don‚Äôt want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that‚Äôs where the clearing house comes in. Let‚Äôs call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.  Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller‚Äôs side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.  ## What‚Äôs Robinhood Going To Do About GME?  Robinhood‚Äôs decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here‚Äôs a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood‚Äôs decision, for fun  * [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905) * [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades) * [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html) * [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood‚Äôs office saying ‚ÄúSuck my nuts Robinhood‚Äù * [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/) * [Congressional investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1) * [SEC investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)  Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It‚Äôs especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally ‚Äúdemocratize finance‚Äù, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood‚Äôs image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.  The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we‚Äôve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** üöÄüåù\*\*.\*\*  ## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash  Let‚Äôs go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I‚Äôll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.  &gt;*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*   &gt;   &gt;*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*   &gt;   &gt;*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*   &gt;   &gt;*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*   &gt;   &gt;*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*   &gt;   &gt;*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*   &gt;   &gt;*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*   &gt;   &gt;*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*   &gt;   &gt;*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*   &gt;   &gt;*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*   &gt;   &gt;*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*   &gt;   &gt;*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*   &gt;   &gt;*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*   &gt;   &gt;*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*  [Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)  In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable ‚ÄúNet Exposure‚Äù, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.  A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN‚Äôs stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would‚Äôve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It‚Äôs very likely that if Robinhood hadn‚Äôt stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we‚Äôve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn‚Äôt look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).  **TLDR**  In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,  1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME üöÄüåù 2. Much of the stock market‚Äôs value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) üöÄüåù the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**  *Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it‚Äôs probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it‚Äôll fall below $100.*  Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).  EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=announcement&amp;utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.  EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

Read further for more details on this retarded theory.  **Disclaimer**: I‚Äôm retarded and have been wrong in the past. This is fan fiction and fairy tales **not financial or investment advice**.  So during the last 2 weeks our wonderful subreddit blew up and is now pretty much known by every person on the fucking planet. I've looked at what is happening overall in the market vs what is happening in the high short % stocks during that time. I've selected a 2 week timeline because I believe during this time everyone on the market (including hedge funds) have discovered what's moving these stocks.  Here's the figures since January 19th (18th markets were closed). I've included the most popular high short % stocks since they're what retail investors (we) seem to be buying with our mouths foaming. I apologize if I left out your favourite meme stock, fuck you, keep reading it's about to get more interesting.  **Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**  High short interest stocks:  GME +680% AMC +330% LGND +47%  SPWR +46% SPCE +40% BBBY +35% FUBO +30%  Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**  **Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**   Selected stocks &amp; indices:  S&amp;P 500 -2,2% NASDAQ -0,5% AAPL +3,2% MSFT +8,5% FB +0,5% TSLA -5,2% GOOGL +2,4%  What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.  Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.  **Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**  Selected stocks &amp; indices:  S&amp;P 500 -1,14% NASDAQ -2% AAPL -5,3% MSFT -1,8% FB -7,3% TSLA -2,5% GOOGL -0,5%  Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.  I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of üíé‚úä retards bidding up their short positions.  I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.  Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more.   In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.  Positions: Cash gang, GME üíé‚úä and üåàüêªSPY FDs  Hope you all have a great weekend!

This is a solid biotech/pharmaceutical company with positive cash flow and a healthy balance sheet. Unlike brick and mortar stores and movie theaters, there is nothing outdated or inherently flawed with this biotech company's business model.  As far as I can tell, the only reason this stock is so heavily shorted is because of a hit piece put out by WSB's mortal enemy Citron back in 2019. Of course, we know that once these short sellers smell blood in the water they pile on, making bearish sentiment a self-fulfilling prophecy. The current short positions seem to be based on his outdated thesis. His price target was $35 and LGND is now sitting pretty comfortably over $120. In other words, he was once again dead wrong with his predictions.   So why hasn't this stock received the attention that other heavily shorted stocks like NOK, AMC, etc have in the past few days?   My hunch is that retail investors look only at the share price and not market cap. **LGND may cost $100+ per share but the market cap is only 2.65B. That is around what Gamestop's was before it received widespread attention as a short-busting target.**   Unlike GME, NOK, AMC, BB, etc. LGND is not blocked by any of the brokers. I'm not selling any of my position in GME but I'm definitely giving this stock some of my attention going forward.  This is not investing advice.

The rationale is so simple even the most autistic among us can understand it. LGND has the second highest % shares short right now (62.07%) second only to GameStop (97.68%). LGND would take 31 days to cover right now, above even GameStop's 6.3 days to cover.  LGND has a higher shares short % than BBBY, AMC, or any other stock besides GameStop. It also has a smaller market cap than BBBY and AMC, and so any activity will move it quickly. BB doesn't even have significant short interest, it's just a long hold play. LGND also has a market cap above WSB's $1B market cap requirement, so there is no worry about the ticker being banned.  You may think AMC has a high short interest, but that's probably because you are using this website [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) Scroll down to the bottom of the page.. it hasn't been updated since January 23rd (5 days ago) as of the writing of this post. This website is more accurate and updates daily [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) AMC is on the 4th page, and is the 60 positions away from being the most shorted stock. It only has 23.7% shares short and the days to cover is 1.26. BBBY is 57.75% shorted with 9.68 days to cover.  LGND is also only up 23% over the last five days as of close last night. It's barely even moved and it's still very early to get in.  Also there are tons of DD posts that are better than anything I could ever write about why LGND is a legitimately good stock. This is more of a long play than a squeeze play, but the short interest is just a bonus.

This epic rally is quite a thing to behold.  I've been seeing some very erroneous numbers being thrown around and wanted to clear the air.  Melvin is not getting crushed single handedly by this GME squeeze. They are certainly not losing a billion for every $12 that GME goes up. Assuming you see this more as a comedy than a tragedy, it's a lot funnier than that.  As of Melvin's last 13F filing, they are actually short 16 different names, GME being a relatively medium size short (at the time), in dollar terms. Of those 16 names they're short, they are down an astounding 14 of them. Not even kidding. That means they would have a nearly 88% success rate if they just Costanza'd it and did the opposite of what they thought was right.  This is the list, I omitted one name from 13F filing because I couldn't find it's chart on Google, feel free to look for yourselves.

Settle down, autists, we're going to get there. First off let's do the DD (and since this is at least partly directed at WSB infants, I'll explain: that means Due Diligence, i.e. the facts). I'm going to link and explain a LOT of posts; if you've already seen them, or you're illiterate, feel free to just read the **BIG APE TEXT** and move along. Still, since we're four sentences in, that filters out the true retards which means I can TL;DR the TL;DR - enough hype can make *any* stock blow up, and there's plenty of super-shorted ones. So let's encourage the sub to grow and continue taking Wall Street up the ass  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ   # OKAY WHAT'S HAPPENING???  **THE SHORT SQUEEZE IS PROBABLY UNDERWAY, DEFINITELY NOT DONE**  Okay, so you may have seen posts telling you to [**diamond hand to 10000 because Melvin is selling**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/) and also [**decent full explanations**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5x0fc/gme_endgame/). These pretty much catch you up to what's happening with GME, but to summarize if you have a goldfish attention span and/or IQ: The past spikes have been gamma squeezes, because when the price goes up, calls make you buy stocks on friday, and when lots of people buy, stonks go up. Short sellers borrow stock, currently at ludicrously high interest, so they can functionally sell stocks they don't own. Soon Melvin (and other short sellers) will have negative money and be forced to buy back stock to cover their loans - when that happens, they *MUST* buy, no matter how pricey it is. GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, and also, the longer everyone waits the more Melvin has to cover, so üíéüñêüíéüñêüíéüñêüíéüñê.  Here's the problem: that second post also tells you NOT to get caught up, NOT to look for the next GME, and even to get out at 384 tops if you're not committed. And that's decent advice, but...  üßªüôèüèª **ARE SELLING, KILLING MOMENTUM**  What these aren't saying is that paper hands *are* crippling the rocket. We were up to 200+ off Daddy Musk's tweet, and 5M volume later, we're... back to 200ish (as of 8 am EST). Look at the pattern on previous premarkets - we've dropped off a cliff *way* sooner than expected. This should have been expected - WSB is only a fraction (I've seen 8%, pretty sure that was an extension of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) survey, whatever, point is &lt;10%) of the market. Even if everyone here held like your wife holds her boyfriend, there's only so much we can do when [**Shitron and Melvin fake selling and coordinate attacks**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l62obe/warning_more_manipulation_on_this_sub_by_gme/) (read the comments on how impossible this is).  # HOW TO SLAUGHTER THE SHORTS  Okay, so that's a lot of boner-killing news, and if I couldn't give you back your erection, I wouldn't have said it. Here's the good news: I'm going to make you harder than ever. Because the fix is easy: Make this shit blow up.  Yes, many of you are whining about relative infants ruining the threads. Yes, bigger subreddits lose quality. Here's the thing: We can try to make WSB retarded again by cutting out normal people, but mods have already said automod is shitting itself from 30-45 days of ban, and we clearly want like 3+ months. The cat is out of the bag. The better alternative: we can make *everyone* retarded. Then, even if nobody is literate enough to read the DD, it's at least verifiable by the dozen people with braincells here.  **SO GET DD TO THE FRONT PAGE**  Also, to be clear, we're not talking galaxy brain, 40 hour-a-week DD. We're talking the basic facts of the stock. I can't tell you how many people I've heard say ""hurr durr it's just a bubble"" or ""short squeeze happened, too late"", because they didn't know there were still *over 100% shorts* **(**[**IT'S STILL TRUE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l642ms/updated_jan_27th_short_interest_data_posted_by_s3/)**)**. Boomers are scarred by 2008 and just can't believe this is really happening. This is not me selling a story, this is literally just saying ""get the basic facts to everyone"". Because that's how these short sellers make a buck - they count on 99% of the population being totally ignorant of the facts.  Now, imagine people watched r/stocks like they did r/sports. And we all knew to turn off lending on our shares, and to exercise call options on friday instead of selling them. At 1/2 the subs, that'd still be quadruple the current sub count - even by a [month old estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) we had 6% of the stock, so even being conservative on every part of this back-of-the-envelope calculation we could hit 20%. It'd be like 200% of the currentüíéüñêüíéüñê even if half the new retards don't go all in. And the best part?  **WE'RE ALREADY DOING IT**  This sub is blowing up. It hit the front page (more or less) multiple times this week. If you idiots get anything RESEMBLING idiot-proof DD to the front page, we're good. GMEüåïüåïüåï's 10 times harder. And I *know* you autists can do it. DFV's an ass-hair away from 100k upvotes, and rising.  # WHY THIS SAVES WSB  **REDDIT CAN'T DUMP THE 'TARDS IF WE'RE ALL RICH TARDS**  Now here's the trick. We all are pissed at CNBC for lying to manipulate the market, but *also* [faking accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4zg6g/one_of_us_on_cnbc_quirkymushroom_you_famous_bro/) (see top comment) and painting us as [organized and thus liable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html) (CNBC link, click at your own risk). Now there's a 0% chance the SEC is gonna knock down your door (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l562zq/its_official_stop_freaking_out_about_the_media/)) but there is a decent chance Reddit decides this is too much and neuters us ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3igst/dont_go_full_retard_think_about_what_you_comment/) guy's a degenerate but he's not wrong).  The whole point is that Reddit will ban a small percentage of its user base if it creates a large amount of legal trouble. Emphasis on **SMALL** percentage. WSB might be celebrating (or whining about) hitting 2 million, but that's not even in the top 100 subs. If people realize it's giving good information on good money, though... not only could that make the sub huge, it also means all the newly minted retard millionaires have all the money in the world to gild the next DFV. If we take over enough, we stop being a autism-infected fingernail for Reddit to clip, and start being the whole damn arm. At that point, they've gotta just take the free publicity and roll with it.  # WHY THIS GETS US THE NEXT GME  **GME IS ONLY THE BEGINNING**  Here's the trick. GME may be at 140% shorted, and it's getting a *great* run. But why stop there? [This](https://www.barrons.com/articles/another-gamestop-here-are-the-next-10-most-shorted-small-caps-51611688092) link (use incognito if it says to login) shows some pretty damn high short ratios, and if you look at, say, [LGND](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/lgnd), it's got several other factors making it a prime Wall Street Whaling target - a HUGE put-to-call ratio, relatively high (\~40%) ownership by hedge funds, and if you look at the graph, it looks like it's already spiking. But that's *not* to say you should jump on it, assuming it's the next train (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I am not a financial advisor, blah blah blah). The point is that *very* casually, just by googling shit, you can find hugely vulnerable short positions. **And then, if enough people are aware of the facts, ANY of them will be as big as GME.** Yes, GME was the perfect storm, which was why nothing like this has happened in a decade... but it's the perfect storm to *open* pandora's box. Now that it's open, the world is starting to realize the power of ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç.  Not only that, once we infect Reddit, we can actually start infecting **EVERYONE ELSE**. Already we've seen boomer parents caught in our grasp - soon, they'll make millions, and they can start telling *their* boomer contacts. This isn't some millennial only club - everyone, from zoomer to boomer, can find an excuse to join. Some will say it's enforcing the complete information requirement of a truly free market. Some will say it's forcibly taking money from the ultra-rich who don't deserve it. But **EVERYBODY LIKES MONEY**, and everybody but the hedge funds likes taking from the hedge funds. And more importantly, this is an incredibly unique opportunity - because for once, sharing means **MORE MONEY** for you, not less.  # TL;DR  Let WSB get huge and then ANYONE can spend 2 seconds researching the next GME. This is how we keep WSB alive. This is how we all get rich. This is how we take ALL the money from ALL the short selling, market manipulating, micro-penis hedge funds.  ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çüí™   (Positions: 19 shares GME, 100% position ratio, I am but a tiny autist but I'm doing my best: [https://i.imgur.com/5V9N37Jh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5V9N37Jh.jpg))"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2894964.0|public|confidence|self|HOW TO KEEP WSB ALIVE - AND FIND THE NEXT GME|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66j86/how_to_keep_wsb_alive_and_find_the_next_gme/|some_ads|7.0|||||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'DtmKXHH1G35yfqcVH9UEcrfSgS7_KTApMQZVypuai7E', 'resolutions': [{'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JOKVxi4adJh8qsWD02ZqWiKv-eO_kAiurVPQA2K5YSI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50a0d5cf0971e3191e4d57df0521e8ecd4ce164b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 432, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JOKVxi4adJh8qsWD02ZqWiKv-eO_kAiurVPQA2K5YSI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=766dc042cc4a2154046e75dda56cea5125d7af3c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JOKVxi4adJh8qsWD02ZqWiKv-eO_kAiurVPQA2K5YSI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d45011e6f28b0be0afcac4eafeb7ef35993fed', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 1024, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JOKVxi4adJh8qsWD02ZqWiKv-eO_kAiurVPQA2K5YSI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9469f212998612ace4a9cf231830b1204ce9184c', 'width': 498}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||2021-01-27|LGND

I'm not aware of any catalyst ie. no Ryan Cohen, will need to rely on retard strength alone. Squeeze Rating: Medium/High  DDS - With a $1.8B market cap and trading close to $80, this is a department store.

IRBT - With a $2.78B market cap and trading close to $100, people are buying lockdown robots left right and center. I even bought one... Overall, I think it's temporary, there's a lot of competitors catching up. Squeeze Rating: Low  LGND - Trades on the Frankfurt exchange, the FRA? Correct? Can't buy it. Squeeze Rating: Low  FIZZ - With a Market Cap of $4.6B and trading close to $100. This company is profitable, their earnings beat analyst estimates. Melvin is short a ton. I've seen a few posts recently about it. Squeeze Rating: Medium/High  SKT - With a Market Cap of $1.25B and trading at $13.50. This is an outlet center. Boring.

Ligand Pharma is currently experiencing ***accelerating*** growth, 55% revenue growth in 2020 and projecting about **67%** revenue growth in 2021. The company owns a bunch of pharma tech, that shitty biotech uses to build their drugs in return for some % of the proceeds in royalties. They have a strong cash position as well **with fucking cash reserves of $800 million on a 1.4B market cap.**   If the drug comes to market, LGND just rakes that shit in. If the drug fails testing, fuck it, it doesn't matter. One of these drugs is the COVID drug **REMDESIVIR** that uses their captisol tech**.**   Vaccine or not, a metric fuckton of people will get Covid in the coming months, and each one of them and their mom is demanding the presidential treatment. Doctors are prescribing this shit hand over fist so they don't get sued out of their ass if a patient dies without getting remdesivir. Gilead isn't making shit from it, but LGND is raking it in.   About 50% of their current revenue is coming from captisol, and remdesivir has been a huge advertisement for that tech. They also have another 8 partnered drugs coming out of phase 3 clin trials soon, and are projecting abt a **50%** increase in royalties next year which is essentially gives em a **100%** margin on that revenue.   Moving away from that shit into the stock price, the stock price is confusing analysts too. Last ER call we got a Q   &gt;Great. Thanks. And then, another question, this is little, pardon me, a little more challenging, but you came out of the analyst event, provided some pretty impressive growth on targets for the next, call it, two to three years and really highlighting how the business is going to shift more and see more growth on the royalty side or I think you can argue, you are going to get more of a valuation benefit for your stock.   &gt;   &gt;But the stock didn‚Äôt react that way. And I am curious, what were your thoughts on that reaction? And what do you think investors are missing that might fill that gap? Thank you.  to which the CEO basically said they're sandbagging guidance.   The stock has an INSANE amt of short interest, **69%** of the stock is held short even with strong YOY growth, guidance for next year beat and raising consensus estimates, and an intact growth story for the years to come. Any kindof good news gonna lead to a short squeeze that'll bring LGND popping over $120. *The downside is low, the upside is immense.*   TLDR; buy biotech company LGND, I recommend 2/19/2021 105c or shares.|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1614000.0|public|confidence|self|Fuck the Shorts ($LGND), a COVID play and DERISKED biotech play|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0xypi/fuck_the_shorts_lgnd_a_covid_play_and_derisked/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-11-25|LGND

I recently stumbled upon Ligand Pharmaceutical ($LGND) when a friend mentioned to me that they profit off of remdesivir by providing the solubilizer that remdesivir is packaged in. This substrate is called capitsol and it allows for increased solubility and therefore increased bioavailability of remdesivir and other drugs. This, to me, sounded like an example similar to Buffett‚Äôs suggestion to not buy gold when there is a gold rush, sell the shovels.   At first glance, Ligand looks very similar to Royalty Pharma in that a substantial portion of their earnings are resultant from successful royalty partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Although there is much more to their story. Their partners and licensees have programs currently in clinical development targeting seizure, coma, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, liver disease, and kidney disease, among others.¬†Needless to say, they are diversified.   On October 20th, they held an investors presentation leading up to their earnings reports on the 30th of the month. Yahoo finance published some interesting takeaways. Let‚Äôs take a look at some ‚Äì  **Business model and growth drivers:**  * Management reviewed Ligand‚Äôs business model and the ongoing diversification of its portfolio. Leveraging the OmniAb, Captisol and Protein Expression Technology platforms, Ligand‚Äôs business model is based on providing drug discovery platforms, completing early stage drug development and partnering. * Ligand highlighted more than 10 major potential pipeline events expected to take place by the end of 2021, including commercial product approvals and Phase 3 clinical trial data, as well as Phase 2 or Phase 2b clinical trial data. * Ligand reported that strong demand for Captisol continues and it forecasts higher needs for Captisol for the manufacturing of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in 2021. * The company‚Äôs growth is expected to be driven by royalty revenue, with projections for a nearly three-fold increase over the next three years, reaching $95 million in royalty revenue in 2023. Approximately two-thirds of 2023 royalty revenue is expected to come from core Ligand royalty programs, and approximately one-third is expected to come from the programs acquired as part of the recent Pfenex transaction. * Ligand summarized its merger and acquisition history, noting it has made more than 20 acquisitions and investments over the past 12 years deploying approximately $1 billion of capital.  **OmniAb technology:**  * Ligand reported that more than 8,500 clinical subjects have been or are planned to be treated by partners in clinical trials with OmniAb-derived antibodies. New clinical programs are pending at Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck, among others. * Ligand expects the first regulatory approvals for OmniAb-derived antibodies in 2021, with potential for as many as 10 approvals expected by 2025.  **Captisol:**  * Ligand‚Äôs management commented that increased visibility for the Captisol platform has driven new agreements to the highest level ever, with more than 120 new research use agreements and a dozen new clinical/commercial agreements. * Ligand and its manufacturing partners have completed capacity-expansion activities over the past six months, with cGMP manufacturing now at four sites including one in the U.S. * In addition to its core role in intravenous formulations, Captisol is also being utilized in other routes of drug delivery including oral, inhalation and subcutaneous. * Ligand maintains a broad global patent portfolio for Captisol with more than 400 issued patents worldwide relating to the technology with the latest expiration in 2033. Other patent applications covering methods of making Captisol could extend protection to 2040.  **Protein Expression Platform:**  * Ligand reviewed its recently acquired Protein Expression Technology platform, noting it has the biopharmaceutical industry‚Äôs most comprehensive prokaryotic protein production platform, protected by 27 issued U.S. patents as well as substantial know-how. This proprietary platform is now validated with two approved products and two more regulatory approvals expected in 2021. * Among a series of case studies and partnership discussions, management highlighted that the platform solved Jazz Pharmaceutical‚Äôs Erwinaze supply challenges due to issues with their manufacturer, resulting in a robust process showing manufacturing consistency and efficiency. The program was completed from commencement to projected first BLA filing in approximately four years.  **Internal R&amp;D programs:**  * Ligand selectively invests in internal R&amp;D to drive partnering events with more robust licensing terms. Management highlighted the Captisol-enabled Iohexol program as a potential participant in the $1.5 billion market for contrast-imaging agents. Ligand is initiating a potential pivotal clinical trial to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury and image-quality equivalence to GE‚Äôs Omnipaque¬Æ. The trial is expected to initiate in December 2020 and, with favorable results, lead to a 505(b)(2) regulatory filing. * Ligand acquired the PF810 program through its acquisition of Pfenex. PF810 is a next-generation peptide therapeutic program focused on endocrinology that leverages extensive internal experience and know-how, with an IND filing targeted for 2021. * Ligand also profiled five OmniChicken antibody programs that are primed for future partnering events.  **Financial overview and outlook, and investment philosophy:**  * Management highlighted Ligand‚Äôs history of strong revenue growth and its expectations for continued growth in the near- and long-term. Revenue growth has contributed to significant cash flow and per-share earnings. * Ligand raised 2020 guidance for total revenue to approximately $170 million ($33 million from royalties, $92 million from Captisol sales and $45 million from contract revenue), year-end cash of more than $300 million, gross margin of 80% to 85%, total cash expenses of $73 million to $75 million, a tax rate of 21% to 23%, and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.95. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS for 2020 represent growth of more than 55% compared with 2019 (excluding revenues from Q1 2019 Promacta royalty). * The company provided a preliminary outlook for 2021 to 2023 financials, including introducing 2021 financial guidance as follows: * Total revenue of $285 million ($45 million from royalties, $45 million from core Captisol customers, $155 million from Captisol related to remdesivir sales and $40 million from contract revenue); * Q1 2021 Captisol sales of $45 million; * Gross margin in the range of 75% to 80%; * Total cash expenses in the range of $80 million to $85 million; * Tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%; and * Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.00. * For 2023, Ligand is expecting total revenue of approximately $220 million, representing a nearly three-fold increase in royalties (with no contribution from Sparsentan or Teriparatide TE approval), approximately 30% Captisol sales growth (does not include potential contribution from remdesivir in 2023) and a nearly two-fold increase in contract revenue, all compared with 2020. * Ligand also reported that total potential contract payments through 2036 now exceed $4.5 billion. Ligand has booked over $200 million of contract revenue over the past five years and reported more than $400 million in risk adjusted total potential contract payments over the next five years. * Management reviewed its capital deployment strategy, which is balanced between M&amp;A and returning capital to stockholders. Ligand has deployed over $2 billion of capital since 2007. Ligand‚Äôs external investments have focused on corporate M&amp;A, representing 50% of capital deployment over the period, while returning capital to stockholders primarily via share buybacks, special dividends and bond repurchases also represents 50% of capital deployment over the period. Ligand noted that funding cycles and its business model create ample M&amp;A opportunity, and that special and/or regular dividends are potential future forms of capital return.  **Summary and Conclusion**  My overall impression is that Ligand is quite undervalued and I predict this stock could see huge growth with these future catalysts. Their balance sheet has little to no debt and $1B USD (maybe 500M USD less if the Pfenex acquisition was not taken into account). Their market cap is \~1.5B USD, with positive cashflows that don‚Äôt seem to be strongly affected by COVID moving forward.

EGHT:  I still think its a buy, just going to take time to work... Long term buy and hold here.  CUBI: Same as EGHT  ASEI: Same as EGHT and CUBI except I would be a buyer into next quarters earnings depending on headlines that come.  IRBT:  Still a buyer, still very cheap.  Think it can go above $35 in next 3 months.  LGND:  Still a buyer, I've done well with it, sold some at $58 but I owned a lot so it was a loss of conviction but more a diversification concern.  VNOM: Buy and wait.  Will throw off nice dividends, rip up if price of oil goes up.  QFOR: Just signed biggest contract they're ever had, stock didn't budge.  My largest personal position.  Max conviction on the stock.  ADDS: AVAV - FAA just released preliminary guidelines for drone rules, these guys are well positioned for police contracts... good story to ride into the next year... can go to $35 in NTM. I'd sell AWAY and slide into this.  SN and OAS as I mentioned above - build third positions in BCEI, SN, and OAS and you should have a nice energy w/ juice exposure  Hope that helps guys and let me know if you have any questions.

Here are the 10 names I believe have a 75% chance of being higher 12 months from now.  I am happy to speak on any one of them. Thank you.   EDIT:  CUBI - growing bank trading close to tangible book led by ex-sovereign CEO Jay Sidu... for those not familiar he grew this from one branch and then sold the thing to Santander.  ASEI - just a stock with a shit load of cash that makes x-ray bomb detection machines.  Business has deteriorated recently but if valued again past year when business was good, it should have 30-50% upside.  LGND - r/stockpick February picks... give a detailed thesis.  EGHT -cloud telephone systems for businesses, huge cost savings to the business because they don't have to allocate resources (i.e. people) to maintain infrastructure.  Growing nicely, makes money... think it can trade at 3x EV/Sales forward multiple which means 15+% upside in forward year.  TWOU - my favorite story in the market... online education platforms for high end university grad programs... they collect 60-70% of all tuition that comes in the door... believe it gets a 6x sales multiple on forward at any point late 2015/ early 2016 which puts the stock at $25.  AWAY - banged down by AirBnb but is the same business model for vacation homes.  has the largest vacation home database.  AWAY grows and makes money, AirBnb hemorrages cash.  They either get taken out at $35-40 or AirBnB announces they are going public and this gets a boost from the comp.  IRBT - outlined story yesterday.  VNOM -special type of MLP that owns RSPP and FANG mineral rights.  They collect a toll every time FANG or RSPP drills with no cost to them.  Dependent on drilling continuing and a highly attractive bet that can pay out nicely.  QFOR - SW company that doesn't report R&amp;D line item and instead puts it into COGS... all products have been developed so margins will expand as they sell more business... think this will trade at a buck by year end as I think they can do 10 mil in EBITDA and get a 10-12 multiple on it.  BCEI - SYRG is the comp which is net cash and held up nicely during energy correction.  Great acreage and should have more juice than SYRG out of the trough given they are 50-50 debt equity.  Just a high quality E&amp;P that can have legs.|||False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|IRBT up 5% since yesterday...

I've avoided AMRN due to my own delay concerns, but it's now 20 days later and the stock has shot up from a labeling leak. Details are all over YMB and Twitter $AMRN.  Whether or not it means FDA approval is beyond me, but it shows how far along they got with the FDA at the time the labeling doc was created which was last month... To go as far as to have it available on a website exclaiming approval? May not say much for delay concerns but with such confidence to put that website online so soon to PDUFA, bodes well.  Approval is inevitable at this point, the question is when and if they were granted exclusivity... It could be delayed, but I've now decided to dismiss my delay fears and risk it. Should be fun :D GL to those long!  LGND/ONXX, HZNP, PGNX/SLXP all have PDUFAs next week. All may have a little bit of wiggle room left to grow in a run up (IMO, in the order I placed them is the order of most potential wiggle room)... Understand that the closer we get to PDUFA, the more likely bear raids and profit taking events take place. LGND/ONXX could still be delayed, but approval odds are very good. HZNP and PGNX/SLXP should be approved, but whether or not approval has been sufficiently priced in depends on how you calculate revenue. Come Jul 26-27 (but preferably every day from now til then), you should all have all of these companies on your screen during the first 30min of the day to pick up on raids.

Multiple myeloma remains ""uniformly fatal"", and the NDA is specific in pursuing approval as a last-resort line of therapy for those not responding to current treatment. It is not a cure.  Capitsol is the mechanism for drug distribution. It has been approved multiple times with LGND, so capitsol-related concerns are not worthy for consideration.  **Trial results:** Before I go into details, it's worthwhile noting that the FDA has granted Expanded Access, allowing those with the greatest need access to the ongoing trials. This meant a targeted expansion to 500 patients, up from 250, for the applicable trials. Only those with at least 4 prior lines of therapies are eligible for the the applicable trials.  Agreement with the FDA on an SPA.  ASPIRE P3 enrollment completed in Feb 2012, designed with the EMA. It is evaluating Kyprolis in combination with Revlimid. P1/2 did not find any significant toxicities and showed promising efficacy for patient population. ENDEAVOR P3 trial was recently initiated and that will compare it with Velcade directly. If ENDEAVOR is successful, it will likely mean, assuming Kyprolis is approved as a last line of defense in the upcoming PDUFA, that ONXX/LGND can submit another NDA to have Kyprolis used as a more front line of therapy.  **Delay details:** Possible. Conference call post-advisory panel suggested (my suspicion, nothing more) a possibility that there are still labeling concerns with the FDA.  **Stock offering details:**  Ligand has 19.7 shares outstanding, 33 million authorized. They had an offering Mar 26 2012 that raised $30 million http://www.researchviews.com/healthcare/pharma/womenshealth/DealReport.aspx?sector=Womens%20Health&amp;DealID=190327 . This was the only news release, so I'm unsure of authenticity. Dilution is very unlikely if it's true.  ONXX has no chance of dilution for any fund-raising needs.  **Manufacturing front:** Absolutely minimal concerns. Both LGND and ONXX have a history of dealing with the FDA and have established manufacturing lines pumping out FDA-approved products.  **Competition:** There is an unmet need for therapy for those not responding to current lines of treatment, and Kypolis has demonstrated positive efficacy for those in need. It's currently undergoing comparative trials to see if it can be used as a more primary method of treatment.  **CRL scenarios:** Unlikely, but the FDA may uncharacteristically (with respect to products up for approval that deal with deadly diseases) request completion of P3 to confirm efficacy and quell safety concerns. A first time NDA for the drug always poses a concern, but given the severity of the disease, this concern may not be warranted.  **Other:**   $1-2.5 billion annual global sales opportunity(2016-2020), ONXX/LGND likely split royalties 90/10 if LGND's past royalty figures are reliable indicators. 20k new patients annually, of which a total of 10-15k patients are refractory (refractory are the type of patients Kyprolis is being marketed for, and it's not 10-15k of the 20k, but rather around 100k total patients).   ODAC Panel Jun 20 did very well, 11-0-1 approved. Question was: ""patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy that included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD)"". This attitude from the panel members and the willingness to extend Kyprolis under passionate use by the FDA suggests a willingness by the FDA to just throw more lines of therapy at the deadly problem if it can help those not responding to current lines of treatment. Safety concerns for Kyprolis are not substantial, nor are weak signals likely to trigger a CRL given the likely alternative, a quicker death.  **PPS Target:**   LGND: Before ODAC, LGND had a market capital of about $250 million, which is coincidentally pretty close to the 52-week low. With ~$30 million revenue, that puts P/E at around 7-8. Now P/E is closer to 11. Assuming similar royalty deals to their other products, we expect around 10% royalties. Combine this with a 2016 estimate of $1 billion sales, that puts 2016 estimate for Kyprolis sales at $100 million. That drives P/E down to ~3, assuming the rest of LGND's marketed pipeline doesn't grow. That would mean that LGND should be doubled by 2016 assuming the launch of Kyprolis goes as projected. With a randomly picked 20% annual growth, that puts 2013 sales at $57 million for Kyprolis. That would put LGND around $30 sometime in 2013 when earnings reports roll in. $27 by end of 2012 if they start selling this year. I think low-$20s is a low-estimate for post-approval price. 17% minimum upside from here IMO, and 60% would be a most optimistic result.  ONXX: Before ODAC, ONXX had a market capital of about $2.5 billion, around 30% higher than 52-week low. That puts P/E at around 10. Now P/E is closer to 13. Assume around 90% royalties. Combine this with a 2016 estimate of $1 billion sales, that puts 2016 estimate for Kyprolis sales at $900 million. With a randomly picked 20% annual growth, that puts 2013 sales at $520 million for Kyprolis. Using P/E of 7, that would put ONXX in the range of $88 sometime in 2013 when earnings reports roll in. $79 by year's end if sales begin this year. Mid-70s sounds reasonable for post-approval price, but anything above $79 is excessive, and that's only ~16% from now. It's possible the market will decide P/E of 10 should stick, in which case 111 PPS is do-able, but this is probably a pipe dream..  **What am I going to do?** Given my other obligations, I'm not likely to buy until we approach the period immediately prior to PDUFA, and it's possible LGND won't be halted if ONXX is. I would also require substantial profit taking to occur before buying in, similar to ARNA's pre-PDUFA profit taking. I know I said I wouldn't hold through PDUFA before, but I did say that was what I knew currently about the company, I know a fair bit more now. In terms of upside on PDUFA, LGND offers more.  **What can be done?** LGND may still be a good run-up candidate to PDUFA if you think mid to high-20s is a decent target for approval.  **Possible future postings**:  SLXP crofelemer PDUFA Sept 5 Extended  IRWD IBS/CC PDUFA early Sept Extended  NPSP Gattex PDUFA Sept 30  SUPN 804 PDUFA Oct  SNTS UCERIS PDUFA Oct 16  IPXL IPX066 PDUFA Oct 21  UTHR reprostinil PDUFA Oct 27  CRTX 080 PDUFA Oct 29  ALXA Adasuve PDUFA Dec  AEGR lomitapide PDUFA Jan 5  ISIS Kynamro PDUFA Jan 29  RPTP RP103 PDUFA Jan 30"||||wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|[ONXX/LGND] Some DD for you guys to chew on.||||http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vzpdh/onxxlgnd_some_dd_for_you_guys_to_chew_on/|||||1341373853.0|||||||||1223322055.0||{}||2012-07-03|LGND

Been under development since '04 and has completed 2 of 3 phase  3 trials.  * Delay: Has already been extended, won't be again. Delay was stated to be unrelated to the product efficacy/safety/trials, and given that manufacturing details were submitted witin the 90-day period of PDUFA, it's likely that was the reason for the delay.  * Manufacturing progress: Recently expanded into Mass. Submitted information Mar 30. Increased headcount. ** edit: ""Recall that Lymphoseek is partnered with leading radio-pharmaceutical distributor Cardinal Health in the U.S. in a 50/50 revenue sharing deal."" This literally drops my manufacturing concerns to almost zilch. **  * CRL: Unlikely, the P3 comparative trials have passed with flying colors, vast improvement over competitors. Some details can be found @ http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NDcwMzUxfENoaWxkSUQ9NTAxMTM5fFR5cGU9MQ==&amp;t=1 and http://lifetechcapital.com/ltc/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/NAVB-Update-05-14-12.pdf The nice thing about comparative trials (yes I think I made that up) is that it clearly shows superiority over the competition. Furthermore, the risks are reduced because both the radiation dosage is lower and, obviously, more nodes were discovered and removed.  * PPS target: $500 million annual market for Lymphoseek. Billion dollar pipeline. ** edit2: $500 million dollar market estimate based on old prices of $150 for treatment... Some recent data suggest that $150 should be closer to $400 to accurately reflect the new costs for some of the scarce material. ** Personally, this is going to be a time-factored exit strategy for me. I am certain I will meet and exceed my goal of 30% monthly annualized return from NAVB, so that's all I need. Exit date? Shortly before PDUFA. Most likely reenter with a reduced position prior to PDUFA.  My primary issue with this company? I didn't buy sooner. I am likely to hold through PDUFA with this one. Remember, I can be wrong, maybe the company doesn't exist except on paper, or a disgruntled ex-employee works for the FDA... Be responsible.  ---  **HZNP position:** Still open, details in previous postings. Time-factored exit strategy in mid-July to increase holding in NAVB and maybe IRWD.  **PGNX position:** Still open, details in previous postings. Exit price of 11, potential for non-halted press release on PDUFA, a stop buy order will do. SLXP offers an even lower-risk position. SLXP has another PDUFA On Sept 5, but I will not be reviewing it. ** edit**: Exited near 10, the calling of NAVB is too strong, GLTL.  **AMRN position:** Closed, not that I think drug doesn't deserve approval, only that I am uncomfortable holding a position this close to PDUFA on a non-extended date. Things like ""Commercial readiness to launch AMR101 through a strategic partner or by Amarin likely with third-party resources"" under 2012 goals concern me. Felt pressure from NVAB today with their volume increase and continued rise. GLTL  ---  **VVUS PDUFA Jul 17:** Reiterating a buy on OREX immediately upon VVUS approval, and buy on ARNA immediately upon VVUS rejection. Stops work in this scenario.  **ONXX/LGND PDUFA Jul 27:** I am not doing DD on this, my decision not to has nothing to do with the company or drug, I just don't trust my judgement with this scenario. I would strongly suggest buying LGND immediately upon ONXX approval, it's likely LGND will not be halted, it wasn't during ADCOM... A stop buy order will do.  **TLON PDUFA Aug 12:** Very high upside, comes with great risk. I will not be doing DD on this, it goes against my rule of not buying into a company that is pretty much bankcrupt at this point. That doesn't mean the company's current drug up for PDUFA and pipeline are not worthy of 100%+ returns from current levels, they are. A stock offering before PDUFA will make me reconsider. Someone was hired to head commercial operations late May. Delay was not related to trials by the FDA (possible manufacturing/labeling issues?). I think it's reckless of management to be this close to being cashless, it either means their CEO is footing the bill or they are superbly confident. Run-up started yesterday. GLTL, make your millions.  **IRWD PDUFA Sun 9:** Future posting likely by no later than mid-July when it's hopefully likely to find itself at a lower PPS. I'm likely to just pour everything in NAVB though.  Likely to be my last biotech post til I've exited HZNP and PGNX.

My **opinion** it will likely be approved: RELISTOR has already been approved for palliative care. Manufacturing and delay concerns are zilch because it has already been delayed and they are still using SLXP as the partner. There are no alternative therapies that I know of and there have been no indication that efficacy or risk are inferior or worrisome. Since this is the same company that got RELISTOR approved in the first place, they are experienced with the FDA approval process.  My strategy: Dilution is possible, as the balance sheet shows that they should be green for another 6 months at least assuming expenses are constant (unlikely). However, they didn't offer more stocks 3 months ago so it's unlikely. When I last wrote about PGNX, stock was hovering over 8. It has since risen ~12.5% to 9.18, and I have a target profit taking PPS of 11. 11 PPS was the level where PGNX found itself pre-PDUFA before the 3 month delay. The only thing that has changed is that we are now closer to a potential announcement for another NDA, and a delay might be suggested by some that the FDA had not yet found anything grevious about the current drug up for approval. If we do not reach 11, it may be worth the risk to hold through PDUFA... All I can say for now is that I'm not likely to hold through PDUFA if I find myself at 11 PPS, and I will not likely reenter unless a substantial profit taking event occurs immediately prior to PDUFA. I would not expect a post-approval PPS to exceed 12 by a noticable margin, but you never know.  **[HZNP] Update**  Some notes: I don't have any cute presentations to link here. When I first posted about HZNP, stock was in the 4.6s... It has since risen nearly ~40% to 6.5s. This isn't to say that the run-up is over. Some of it can be attributed to 2 new marketing agreements that should expand American sales and begin marketing in Latin America/Asia, and the patent approval for the relevent drug being discussed here. There may be some risk involved for a substantial correction prior to the final runup towards PDUFA on July 26th, but if you were to ask yourself that question when I had bought in at around 4.9, it had already run up from 4 from the beginning of the month... Then some wsber asked the same question at 5.7s and now it's at 6.5... Expecting a correction can be costly, but if you have reason to believe it still has not reached an acceptable pre-PDUFA high, then perhaps it's worth the risk buying in on the high.  Set catalyst deadlines: **PDUFA for July 26th** for Lodotra  My **opinion** for why it will likely be approved: LODOTRA has already been approved and has launched in Europe. Yes, the EMA is not the FDA, but it does give it a significant vote of confidence leading into the PDUFA because we can be that much less worried about manufacturing/labeling issues and some non-public severe risk signal. Mundipharm is the big partner in this, and they are also the ones involved with Europe's launch. HZNP has aleady recently previously achieved approval for another drug through the FDA, assuring us that they are experienced in the FDA NDA process. Efficacy was also superior to alternatives and placebo as shown in CAPTRA-1.  Brief summary of what drug does: Reduces morning stiffness associated with R. arthritis. It is superior to alternatives because it does a controlled release.  My strategy: Dilution is possible, but the cash outflow is lower than PGNX and they have $80 million in cash on hand. Delay is also possible, but for what possible forseeable reason? I don't know.  I'm likely to stick with the run-up until a week or 2 before PDUFA. I can't say at this time if I'll buy back in prior to PDUFA, but it's possible if there is profit taking in the immediate period prior to PDUFA. Price target? I think double digits is very possible in light of all the recent developments.  **Other notable plays**  VVUS and AMRN. You can read a previous posting about my July plays for these 2 stocks, but I'm not as bullish on PDUFA with these 2 as I am with HZNP and PGNX. Both do have very real upsides, but, unlike AMRN, VVUS has a very real downside. AMRN's AMR101 and likely-to-be-approved patent for the expanded use of AMR101 for 10x the population are likely to be massive blockbusters. VVUS has adequately dealt with the FDA and all their concerns, but with the risk profile, I personally will not be holding through PDUFA... I am currently holding AMRN stocks, and have been since last Thursday, I think there is juice in this yet and with an official patent approval, this stock may yet rise even more on top of the recent pop.  1 obesity PDUFA is enough for me. OREX did go up during ARNA's PDUFA, so it's worth keeping a buy order on hand in case of qnexa approval... Likewise, ARNA will most certainly go up if VVUS is rejected... Considering ARNA will not be halted, it may be worthwhile to be spamming refresh on VVUS's press page so you can immediately buy either/both OREX and ARNA during July 17th. However, just because OREX has behaved so fucking predictably at every positive obesity-related news, doesn't mean it will continue to do so. If you want in on VVUS or AMRN, the DD is on you... I can only say that run-ups are usually a given this far out on such blockbuster drugs, but you do run the risk of an early announcement or delay(for AMRN). Personally, I am bullish on both, just not bullish enough to risk sitting through either PDUFAs with my recent gains.  VVUS PDUFA is July 17th, and AMRN PDUFA is July 26th.  Lastly, ONXX/LGND had a great ADCOM recently, and there PDUFA is July 27th. I have not done enough DD for this stock yet, but when I do, I'll make another post in &lt;week. With what little I know right now, I will **not** be holding through PDUFA, nor do I currently have any shares. With all the competition this drug faces, and the side effects involved, I'm just not comfortable right now to say that a delay is not likely, or that approval is likely.  **ARNA**  Unless you want to hold ARNA for 6+ months, I would think strongly about profit taking in the immediate future. With the DEA scheduling delay of 3-6+ months, that gives institutions plenty of time to wait for the PPS to drop before they increase their meager holds in this stock. If you want to hope for a buyout or late bull raid, I wish you the best, but that is not my strategy so I won't be doing that. On the other hand, the CEO was on CNBC today and gave a strong suggestion that the pill will be ~$3 a pop, 2x a day... which makes post-ADCOM projections of 12 pps even more conservative. However, with foresight that a DEA scheduling would be initiated, I would lower the 12pps to 11 or 10. I will be watching ARNA closely the next couple days to see if there is a run-up to account for this newly released pricing knowledge. The thing to remember here is that ARNA only makes 30% of the revenue... Think of ARNA as a biotech company with $4-6 billion market capital right now still 6+ months out from launch and no earnings releases yet and you can see why retail investors may not sit idly. Institutions will increase their holdings in this company, but it will take the better part of the year.  Congratulations to everyone who held through PDUFA, but if you bought in 9+ for the first time and held through PDUFA, even 7+, you better have done a shit load of research otherwise your strategy is going to get you burned hardcore in the future. Otherwise, only people with a lot of diversification or a small position should be risking such plays. Don't be too greedy.  If anyone bought into SUPN despite my uncertain post regarding it, congratulations again.  GL July! I personally hope massive profit taking takes place with ARNA so that they start filling up in other immediate biotech plays, which will make my run-up plays very profitable.||||wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|Final update on July biotech catalysts||||http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vpsgg/final_update_on_july_biotech_catalysts/|||||1340847301.0|||||||||1223322055.0||{}||2012-06-28|LGND

However, much of the company has prior FDA compliance experience since it is a spinoff from a larger company. * Probable chance of 3-month delay or abnormally early decision * It is a generic epilepsy drug already in the market (but not by SUPN) that uses SUPN technology to reduce side effects by extending distribution over a longer period; thus, efficacy was satisfied and safety improved * Submitted without P3 data, nor do I think P3 data is being pursued. A competitor has petitioned the FDA to require SUPN to provide P3 data. * Absolutely remote chance of common stock offerings before pdufa * High risk of shit hitting the fan in the event of denial  **My plan if initiated:** Get up early (why couldn't I live on east coast) and see if approved, buy on profit taking dip or &lt;5.5 pps.  **[VVUS] VVUS inc**  * Qnexa anti-obesity PDUFA July-17 * No chance of delay or common stock offering * Manufacturing concerns are probable in the event of a CRL. No partnership or plan public, thus distribution isn't likely to happen quickly even if approved. * Great efficacy, alongside worrisome risk factors involving birth defects... REMs inevitable. * ADCOM did give it a great approval of 20-2.  **My plan if initiated:** I think buying Orex and/or ARNA on July 16th is a good move. OREX goes up no matter what, and ARNA is not likely to suffer much if VVUS is approved. A possible play is warranted alongside ARNA PDUFA, but I'm going to be fully engaged with ARNA... OREX would be a good play alongside ARNA PDUFA though.  **[HZNP] Horizon Pharma**  * LODOTRA/ROYAS RA PDUFA on 26-July * Minimal risk of delay or common stock offering * Manufacturing concerns are not there... It's already approved in Europe and the Mundipharm partner has expanded their partnership to include South American and other markets.  **My plan if initiated:** Buy in 3.5-4 range, sell immediately after PDUFA. Sell prior to PDUFA if I feel the run-up has gone too far and buy on a dip if it occurs.  **[AMRN] Amarin Corp.**  * AMR101 high-tri PDUFA for 26-July * High efficacy and low risk profile, large opportunity for similar drugs in pipeline * Manufacturing concerns are legitimate... Company profile seems to suggest an abundance of selling companies and there is a lack of data regarding distribution of product and sales teams. * Delay probable due to possible manufacturing shortcomings * Possible case for common stock offering  **My plan if initiated:** Buy for run-up, sell before PDUFA, and buy if there is a substantial profit-taking events prior to PDUFA.   **[PGNX] Progenics Pharm.**  * RELISTOR constipation PDUFA for 27-July, no delay chances * Manufacturing concerns should be quelled with the presence of SLXP as a partner * Efficacy is acceptable, but there was a doubling of side effects vs placebo  **My plan if initiated:** Buy for run-up to 10-11. For those optimistic of approval, SLXP provides a safer alternative. Without advisory or previous CRL history, relying on FDA acceptance of the increased side effects is a gamble I'm not currently willing to take. **edit: Take note that it's already approved for use by those undergoing palliative care.**  **[LGND or ONXX] Onyx Pharm or Ligand Pharm.**  * Carfilzomib myeloma PDUFA for 27-July * Monitor advisory for further professional opinions. ADCOM scheduled for 20-Jun. * Manufacturing concerns are minimal due to history of approved products * Efficacy and safety as good or better than competitiors * NDA submitted with P2 data, P3 trials ongoing  **My plan if initiated:** Wait for advisory results.||||wallstreetbets|t5_2th52||||self|[Biotech] Notice for July plays||||http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxa8m/biotech_notice_for_july_plays/|||||1340307735.0|||||||||1223322055.0||{}||2012-06-12|LGND
