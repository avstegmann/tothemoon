[citation needed]  The automobile is obsolete for the purposes of the everyday man, and honestly, the whole concept was dead before it even hit the mass market. Horses are the superior solution. **You should be investing in horse**  Now, before I go any further, I'd like to clarify that I'm not a horse nerd. There are no horses in Trigun so they can't be THAT important. They're not my favorite animal, I don't really have a top 10 favorite animals but if I did they probably wouldn't be on it. I don't know any horses irl, I haven't studied them or anything, I probably know more about any random breed of dog or species of bird I've been around in everyday life than I know about all horses combined. There are anime I haven't seen that I might know more about and care more about than horses if it weren't for the economic importance of horses as a mode of transportation. The point is there's no personal bias behind this belief, it is all logic and math and rationality. I love cars too, but car people are objectively wrong and always have been and we need to accept that. ~~I am secretly a horse.~~  I'd also like to clarify that this post is not satire, I sincerely believe in this thesis even though I recognize that it's funny. It's also funny to me that no matter how I try to drive that point home some people will still insist it has to be satire, so I'll just leave it at that.  ------  #The Horse of Christmas Past   Horses were here before us. Humans evolved over the past few million years, becoming today's species in the past few hundred thousand. Horses became what they are today 5 million years ago, after refining similar prototypes for 50 million years. Their evolutionary tree advanced more quickly than ours due to shorter reproductive generations. In some ways, they are still more advanced than us because of this and will continue to be until we master genetic engineering. Humans are only the most evolved species by certain key metrics, and because of that many foolish humans underestimate other species.   While we were adapting to live in dense forests climbing around in tree canopies and visiting the ground to hunt and forage, horses were adapting to the ground. While we were adapting to eat everything possible and kill everything possible, they were adapting to live on sparse vegetation and just chill and try to avoid predators.   But they couldn't avoid us. We started figuring out how to navigate wherever the fuck we want so we weren't just limited to the dense forests. We got more and more nomadic coming down from the trees to chase more and more difficult prey as our ancestors developed the peak levels of a skill nothing else on earth could ever achieve before or since.  Horses must have been a supreme challenge for us from the first time we encountered them in the plains. We were so used to chasing down such beasts by then, yet they surprised us with how difficult it was to catch them. We couldn't always predict their actions. They would sometimes be smart enough to fight back before getting exhausted, which was a problem for us when we didn't have guns and didn't have a chance of killing such large prey without exhausting them before the physical engagement. And it took forever to exhaust them. They could outrun us so badly over a short distance and they have instincts for avoiding tracking. We could kill anything we put our minds to, yet they became one of the few animals even our most capable ancestors saw as too difficult to be worth attempting to hunt if any other options are available.   So our two species developed a relationship of mutual respect. Humans weren't like this with many species back then. And humans continued to advance and like 10,000 years ago we got to the point where we have agriculture and we can start choosing which species to hunt based purely on preference. I guess sometimes some crazy horse must have actually let someone get close to it without expecting to get killed, and the crazy person it happened to must have been like ""I'm gonna climb on your back now pls don't kill me"" and at some point around 3500 years ago someone in Asia did that without getting killed and everyone thought that was cool as fuck so the idea of trying to get close to horses and climb on their backs caught on.   Next thing you know Mongolia was like ""we have horses and we're pretty good at dealing with them, let's breed an absolute shitton of them and come up with creative ways to use them for warfare"" and soon they were taking over everything on the horizon of their sphere of influence by doing drive by shootings with horses and really powerful bows and arrows that no other military at the time could do jack shit about.   **The mistake those militaries made was they underestimated horses and fell behind in cultivating them as a resource.** Also helped that they made the same mistake with ranged weaponry. Does the US military have enough horses today? I don't think so. We just overcompensate with ranged weaponry and it's pretty gay. Mongoloids can still fuck us up any time just in a different way from how they did those ancient militaries.   Horses continued to grow in prominence as the preferred method of transportation. Humans worldwide grew into the lazy species we are today, incapable of hunting without artificial assistance for our lack of cardio. Horses grew into a staple of the shared global culture of nations and the abuse and neglect of horses that was deeply ingrained by the militaristic history of their domestication also became embedded in human social culture along with them. Life with horses was easier for humans, and less healthy for our bodies and souls. We committed deadly sins and poisoned the well of our collective timeline on this planet. Greed. Sloth. Gluttony. Rage. Some British royalty even went as far as lust. Our relationship with the horse couldn't get more fucked up.  Or could it?   ^(""No Happy Endings"" from the GTA V soundtrack begins playing in the background of the post.)  -----  #The Horse of Christmas Present   The new Bugatti has over 1000 horsepower. The horses on the plains are last year's model of cars overflowing from the parking lot, remainders from what didn't move in holiday sales. The new Model S measures its horsepower in watts, and it can do 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 2 seconds.   The anthropocene extinction event killed the last surviving member of yet another species in the time it's taking you to read this.  We were set up. The bank will give you a loan for a car. They won't let you finance a horse.   Henry Ford knew you'd think this shit is cool. But how would you justify the cost? The car had to get cheaper than the horse. Someday it would have to reach the people who couldn't even afford horses in order to outcompete them. But it couldn't do it on its own. For this to be accomplished, the car would have to get cheaper, *and* the horse would have to get more expensive, relative to what people could afford in terms of both time and money.  Fools said Ford's business prospects were impossible. Too contrary to the realities of the market. But Ford was no fool, he knew which way the wind was blowing. The world was being taken over financially by oil barons and confidence was fading regarding the ability of the gold-backed US treasury to maintain economic control and stability. Oil was becoming the new backing of the US dollar and Ford was betting on it.   Others didn't see the market forces that would require this to happen. Sure, the working man might not want to say goodbye to his horse, but the industrialized world needs him following a strict routine and getting to work on time and he wants to get home in time to relax a bit without having to clean a horse stable. With this new form of industrialized poverty subtly squeezing the average family's wealth and freedom away from them with promises of a better future, all Ford had to do was offer a vision of that future he could materialize and he'd have the support of the ruling class and their underlings alike.  We are on the verge of a blue ocean event. Oil is becoming difficult to produce and transport to consumers at the scale of today's demand while the most easily accessible supplies run dry and we turn to more and more difficult sources. Global agriculture is at war with an ever-intensifying barrage of freak weather events. Those in charge say it doesn't look like anything to them.  To understand what's happened here, you have to look at it from the perspective of someone who had a horse before Henry Ford, and did not have a horse anymore after. Most people liked their horses and wanted to continue having horses. Cars were less refined at the time and didn't do as good of a job of hiding their drawbacks, and people not being used to them weren't going to hide those drawbacks from themselves too eagerly either. They were more complicated to deal with than horses, with machinery that could need repairs instead of biological ability to heal. They were large and powerful and metal, with no minds of their own, and could thus be used by idiots to get in terrible car accidents endangering everyone else, especially pedestrians. They caused pollution. They got their fuel from gas stations very particularly instead of a wide array of potential sources. They had obvious benefits and they were obviously cool but a lot of people hated them and even people who liked cars wouldn't think horses were totally inferior in comparison. So how were they convinced to not have horses anymore, almost universally? If you realistically imagine being alive at the time and going through it yourself, it's clear the benefits of the car were made more important than the drawbacks by factors outside your control and you were forced to choose the car over the horse. Maybe you were an early adopter or maybe you were one of those people who hated cars, but either way, society shifted into one that expected you to have a car and not everyone had money for both a car and a horse.   The new Hellcat with over 800 horsepower is the perfect gift for a loved one! Look at this relatable commercial of a car in a driveway with someone crying about how surprised they are at it! Don't drink and drive 😉🙈🙉🙊  Whoever said people would have wanted a faster horse, they were wrong. People were already faster than horses over a long enough distance and span of time when we discovered horses, though not by much. We got slower by switching to horses from our own feet. But we got a higher top speed, which is why we did it. And we'd have adopted cars for fun if they had a higher top speed than horses while being slower over long distances, but poor people still would have used horses for that long distance capability. The ruling class are the ones who cared about the time cars could save us rather than the fun that could be had with their speed. They wanted us to switch from horses because they wanted us to be faster over long distances to make the economy work the way they wanted it to, not because they knew they could make bank on how fun we would think it is to go zoom zoom. Hence cometh the pressure to adopt the automobile. Understand this.   And while Henry Ford wanted horses to be seen as obsolete for the sake of his business, the masters of the economy wanted horses to be abandoned by as many people as possible in this transition to the automobile. If they made sure nobody was poor enough to be forced to choose between a horse and an automobile, then nobody would be forced to go to a gas station, ever. It would always be optional. If gas got too expensive, people would just take their horse places instead of their car until gas was worth paying for again. Oil barons would have to do actual business. That's not how they do business. They needed the masses reliant on an oil based infrastructure and economy.  Now here you are, surfing WSB and reading what's probably just a massive shitpost to distract yourself from how depressingly difficult it is to escape poverty.   How much horsepower does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll pop?  How much horsepower does it take to move a skyscraper-sized cargo ship run aground in the Suez Canal?   How much horsepower does it take to dominate global militaries? A lot more than it took in the time of Mongolia.   We can't afford all this horsepower. Nature did not intend for it to be wielded so carelessly, so she's sent the repo men to collect it from us. We've been in a car chase trying to get away for a while but it's not going to happen. We're going to run out of gas and we know it.   Cars once seemed worse than horses because they were big metal machines with no minds to stop idiots from crashing them into things. Now a Tesla does have a mind of its own and it convinces idiots not to stop it from crashing itself into things.   Everyone is piecing together their plans for what to do when it's over. Some people are trying to go to Mars with Elon Musk. Some people want isolated off-grid self-sufficient defensible properties here on Earth. Some people want multifuel military trucks or engine conversion kits to run their cars on biodiesel. Some people are struggling to accept the bad possibilities facing them and start planning for them at all. I want a horse.  The descendants of those global oil barons have bunkers and nukes.   We have billions of humans who don't want to be ruled by criminal psychopaths.  How terrifying for both sides.  The arctic is the most powerful weapon humans have and it's already been activated in this tension. We fast-forwarded to the end of this ice age and it's upon us now.  The ruling class have been planning for it ever since they started getting good at climate science, about halfway through their first century of global dominion. This transitional period is doing most of the work for them in culling the growing rebellion worldwide and most people might not realize what's going on for quite a while. They're hoping the remaining populations will be easier to dominate and control. They want as many servants as possible remaining in the end so they do try to give everyone a chance to survive. The extent of the culling is up to the reactions of the populace. After a certain point their protection just runs out and you're on your own because they can't afford to control this population anymore and they've chosen to risk the fate of the planetary ecosystem itself rather than risk being overthrown so they're not going back on that. Metal as fuck, mad props.  They even spread a myth that humans are overpopulated, as if it has nothing to do with people using vastly more expensive resources than necessary to accomplish basic tasks in maladaptively unnatural ways. They try to convince you they're being perfectly reasonable when they keep death rates close to birth rates to do ""population control."" This campaign has been so successful some people are cheering now that the death rate starts to exceed the birth rate and life expectancy goes down. It's eerily similar to people who insist they have to use crude oil to avoid being controlled by the ruling class, somehow.  Horses were our friends and we didn't deserve it. We shouldn't have betrayed them.   It's ok. They'll forgive us. They're fucking retarded too.   -----  #The Horse of Christmas Future, or: How I Learned To Reject Society and Return to Monke  ^(The soundtrack is now ""Civilization"" by Danny Kaye.)  When the oil infrastructure collapses, people will need horses again.   But not for transportation, since we'll probably be doing plenty of cardio all the time and at this point we've invented the bicycle.  It's their industrial output that can interfere with the plans of the ruling class. We're not supposed to be in charge of our own freight transportation when gas stations are out of gas for good. The intention of giving everyone vehicles that are difficult to power independently is to ensure that. Horses fuck that all up, the ruling class would have to nuke all the grass to stop us from fueling them.   Those who have horses will be in a good position to survive because of this. When everyone else runs out of gas, horse people are one of the options they'll turn to for transportation of goods. A horse and buggy carrying produce will be a regular sight to see. Their services will be in very high demand and they'll be paid well and they should be able to handle their own security too. They'll be glad they own horses.   People who don't own horses will be glad others own horses for the same reason. They might become the thing keeping your grocery store alive. If so, you will wish more people all over the country had horses so stores could have more stuff in stock instead of struggling with such a downscaled supply chain. And you'll definitely wish you were one of the people with horses.   Living in an area with low population density and high horse population density will be good, not just due to the correlation between wealth and having horses, but due to the cause and effect of horses being useful.   But this won't protect us from crop destruction or nukes. It only helps you stay alive longer. It lets you avoid having the collapse of the oil based transportation infrastructure be the thing that kills you. Owning a Cybertruck and a renewable power source could do basically the same thing for you. No big deal.   The effect gets a lot more interesting with a critical mass of horses. And the possibility is so interesting because unlike Cybertrucks, horses are self-replicating, so it's plausible we could have that critical mass of horses.   If everyone had a horse right now, this whole transition could essentially be stopped in its tracks. The next stage of the plan the ruling class are following wouldn't work and adapting on the fly would be difficult for them. I guess that seems like a moot point or a catch 22 since it's the reason they don't let everyone have a horse, but think about it.   Let's say life gets a lot darker one of these days while we all have gas and electric cars and the people of California decide to secede and start a civil war over the crimes of the ruling class because they're starving to death. The ruling class can just cut off gas and electricity in California and make a powerful example of them.   If everyone had a horse in addition to their gas or electric car, it wouldn't make such a powerful example for the empire's side. If anything California would make it better propaganda for their side by Frankensteining together a new mix of an industrialized economy with horses doing industrial work and inspire other surrounding states to do the same. Using horses for freight would free up a lot of off grid power sources for factories and stuff to keep operating. Maybe some gas could even be conserved for emergency vehicles.  And what are they going to do instead, just use the nukes? Kinda hard to do that reliably without a bunch of escalation and fear mongering leading up to it. ""Nuke california the moment they threaten secede over starvation conditions"" doesn't have a great ring to it. They have to abandon certain policies and come up with a better plan.  Obviously, the idea of everyone having horses is unrealistic. But it doesn't take everyone having a horse. 60% of people suddenly having horses within the next 5 years would make a huge difference. That's closer to realistic. Hopefully what can realistically be done is enough to make a dent. Right now there are areas with enough horses and areas without enough horses, and investing in horses at least has very realistic potential to shift an area from not enough horses to just enough horses for when shit gets real. Increasing the land mass controlled by people with enough horses helps the whole planetary power balance.  Horses aren't the only thing like this. There are lots of things the ruling class don't let too many people have because they can foil these plans so bigly if everyone has them. Investing in any of those things can make a huge difference.   But horses are special in this category because they're self-replicating. If you spend the next few years dedicating your life to getting as many horses made and distributed to citizens as possible I think you'd have more success than trying to do the same with Cybertrucks or self-defense Predator UAVs. Timmy Horsecum could make Johnny Appleseed look like Jim Eagle.  The more money you put into horses, the more you'll be glad you did when the horse vs oil arc gets closer to its conclusion.  Horses offer the potential for a future where instead of going extinct or entering ages of depression after running out of oil, humans just go back to being the best long distance runners on the planet and we overthrow our shitty ruling class and we build a society with all the greatest strengths it can have. A world where you trade some silver for a physical copy of a video game and then walk out of the store and jog home past farmers hauling produce behind their horses.   This could even convince the ruling class to just stop culling people by easing the tensions that drive the conflict. They get less control, but they're also less threatened by people who are content with a healthier lifestyle than their own unnatural luxuries. Maybe seeing the losers of the rat race break out of it and find such a wholesome way to live with less luxury could even convince them the rat race is pointless. Lol nah  If Elon Musk is serious about making Earth sustainable and preventing climate catastrophe, he should be investing billions into horses all over the world. He should be saying donkeys will be used on Mars for certain work until it becomes feasible to bring the mass of horses there for more serious work. Cybertruck can be the official truck of Mars, but if there's ever any kind of economic crisis on Mars that impacts things like factory output or electrical capacity people will be glad they have self-replicating self-healing haulers called horses as an emergency backup for stuff like tilling crops or hauling ores.   Horses in space. I wonder how fast a horse could run on the moon. What an astonishing era of progress and development we could be on the cusp of.  ------  #Horse through the lens of top-down analysis   Some places are better for business than others. The same countries that are best for business are usually also best for horses.   Examples:  * America is a decent country for horses because of its wealth, which also makes it attractive to investors. * Venezuela's inflation crisis hurt financial performance there tremendously, and also likely made it a worse place for horses.  * The covid crisis made Earth less attractive to investors and made Mars travel more attractive to investors. The covid crisis probably killed horses on Earth via supply chain issues and stuff but did not hinder any future potential there may be to get horses to Mars. * Places with very fair weather are good places to be a horse, good places to own a horse, good places to run a business, and good places to own a business. Erupting volcanoes are the opposite end of the spectrum by all these same metrics. It all scales proportionally.   So, whatever market you choose to invest in, it is probably bound to be a good market for horses. GDP growth and such metrics are surely causatively correlated with horse health and the economics of horse ownership.  When assessing different sectors within an economy, horses are relevant to the most important sectors of every economy. Freight is important everywhere and they can be used to power it over land (while sails are ideal for the seas, but that's a whole other post). I'd argue current global market conditions make freight important everywhere. And in countries that are in economically strong positions, it's easy for horses to compete industrially in those economic climates because those are the countries that can afford to implement things like the carbon tax to reduce any undeserved or unnatural economic advantage the oil industry's infrastructure has. Work horses exist on earth but they are so underutilized in the developed economies where they could be most competitive that people in developed economies forget they do even exist in the world. It's a huge gap in global markets and it could be an absolute money printer.   Sector-by-sector, freight isn't the only place where horses can be useful. Take agriculture for example, it's another very important industry in every market worldwide right now and another industry horses are actively used for in parts of the world today. Let's make that more parts of the world.  As far as I can tell, top-down analysis should lead you to see favorable environments for horse investing all around.   ------  #Horse through the lens of bottom-up / fundamental analysis   Horse is one of the longest-standing investment vehicles and there couldn't be a better definition of buying something at the bottom. Fruits and veggies are the absolute oldest investment, but they have had steady growth all along while horses have been pushed back so heavily by central bank meddling that they're at least as primed for a short squeeze as silver. Horses haven't been as undervalued as they are today since before the foundation of Rome. Yet they've survived that whole time without going bankrupt, and they're primed to explode in value. Horses might seem expensive right now, but when you adjust for inflation and consider that the people who first domesticated horses were risking their lives to do it, we're actually way below IPO price. The share price might have been lower even adjusted for inflation back when there was more dilution but I doubt the market cap of horse has ever been this low when you account for the total float of outstanding horses.   **Management:**  The CEO of horse is mother nature, the most badass CEO of all time. The other C-level executives are all horses, the most retarded executive team of all time, so management is a mixed bag in terms of credentials. But while their competence is questionable, they have survived in virtually every market on earth for thousands of years without any operational interruptions, and this is still the same CEO who pulled through all of that with the same retarded horse executives, so I have faith in horse's execs to keep the company afloat for the foreseeable future and do the best they can with the realities of the market. I do think it would help if activist investors would get involved and bring what they can to the table when it comes to executive direction.   **Financials:**  Horse has $0 of debt and $0 of cash on hand. Liabilities are in the thousands of dollars per year per horse and revenues are dependent on utilization of each horse and market conditions. There will never be a year where horse reports negative EPS, because horse doesn't report EPS; instead, every year, the most profitable horse investors make money and the least profitable horse investors lose money. All you have to do to guarantee good returns on your horse is actually use it for something profitable instead of just keeping it as a pet since that's all the average horse investor really does. Horse breeding, for example, is a profitable business with good revenue.  **Market Valuation:**  The current market cap of the horse industry is less than a trillion dollars worldwide. It's not even as big as the market cap of agricultural equipment. The auto industry is worth well over a trillion dollars. When horses are more useful than cars and tractors again, the horse industry may be worth multiple trillions as it consumes multiple other industries such as these.   The common opinion right now is that horses will never overtake these other industries again. This false assumption is what leads horse to be undervalued. There can essentially only be upside for horse's value in this situation because if the market is right, the value of horse doesn't go down as they continue fulfilling the role the market expected them to have, but if the market is wrong and horse does become the new way to get to work, the value of horse can be expected to increase in the eyes of investors.   ------  #Comparison of horse against other investment vehicles   In retrospect of everything this post has established so far, let's compare horse to other prospects you could put your money into.   ::: | Horse | TSLA | SPY | BRKA | Cannabis | The Cult ---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------- **Track record** | Millions of years of uninterrupted operations | Like a decade of bears getting rekt by cool cars | Stonks only go up | Grew from a textile mill into a multi sector corporate behemoth | Dank | Pumped a dead stonk from $5 into the hundreds **Potential upside** | Could save you and the world from the apocalypse in exchange for your friendship | Could save you and your world from the apocalypse in exchange for your eternal soul in the Matrix | Stonks only go up | Old dude could be smarter than everyone else again | Legal market share can only increase and there is no cost to having the world saved | Could pump more **Potential downside** | Will die and make you sad | Might kill you while you cross the street on Mars someday | Stonks... Go down? | Old dude might not got it anymore | World could end before legalization | Big dump could kill all pumping   There are other good opportunities on the board, don't get me wrong. Cannabis is indeed dank. But the horse really seems very competitive with all the best things you can compare it to.  ------  #Why gambling on horses is the ultimate Wall Street Bet and this post isn't just a joke  You want to make the ruling class suck your dick and prove you're smart enough to beat the market, right? Investing in horse puts the ball in your court. Like I said, there will never be a year where horse reports negative EPS, instead there are individuals who get positive and negative EPS every year and the question is whether you're going to be an above average or below average horse investor. You can't boil it down more than this.   People have also been gambling on horse races since long before there was Wall St. If you start a big horse corporation you can bring it full circle.   And the hedgies can't compete with us on this. They aren't going to set up horse stables on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange or in the offices of Citadel. The best they can do is trading horse futures on their computer screens. The everyday man will be the one who can actually take physical delivery, not the big traders. It lets us turn the tables on them in this financial arena aside from how it throws a wrench into their plans to cull us with the peak oil collapse.  Now, if you're with me so far at all, the best you might be thinking is ""ok, I'm convinced, it would be great if we all invested in horses. It's funny that such a ridiculous idea can actually be convincing. But it's not gonna happen, this post isn't gonna trigger a wave change in society, not everyone reading this is gonna buy a horse, horses are just expensive as fuck and the only people who can really take this post seriously and expect to make money are people who just like horses a lot.""  You underestimate me and yourself. I'll be trying to get rich enough to put real money into this horse idea like Elon Musk did with Tesla back when electric cars sounded almost just as retarded. If you buy a horse or invest somehow in horses right now you'll make bank if I succeed. Or maybe I'll fail and you can be the one to succeed, *if* you're as ballsy as me and take the concept seriously enough to try. All it takes for the idea to actually go from a funny reddit post to an economic sea change that was once hypothesized in a funny reddit post is for the right person to try hard enough to make it happen.  If humanity survives much longer, there will be some period of time with fewer trucks and cars, more horses and bicycles. It's not a joke taking that seriously before everyone else.  ------  #TLDR:   Long horse"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9694442|public|confidence|self|Horse: the past, present, and future of terrestrial transportation 🐎🏇🎠🌎🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgomc6/horse_the_past_present_and_future_of_terrestrial/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-03-30|FORD

A car company is more than just one person. You can’t just bash the guy and call it DD.” Well, you may be right, but when there’s no car, no financials (Q4 2020 and FY 2020 results went out as a press release, but 10Q and 10K missing from SEC database), I need to rely on trust in the people running the show. Let me go through how I got to these conclusions and you can see if you agree. I’ll try to avoid too much pop psychology, but man this guy…it’ll be hard.   &amp;#x200B;  Buckle up, this is gonna be looooong.  &amp;#x200B;  **Quick Background: The Early Years**  Fisker has a Degree in transportation design from the Art Center College of Design in Switzerland. Rock start vehicle designer with BMW and Aston Martin where he designed the Z8, X5, DB9, and V8 Vantage. \[1\]  Design experience, but doesn’t show any connection to vehicle dynamics, engineering, or manufacturing.  Does some work with/for Tesla back in 2007. Gets sued for allegedly only taking the job to steal confidential information to be able to start his own company – Fisker Automotive. Fisker wins in arbitration, with a finding that he did nothing wrong. \[1\] I mention this not to throw shade (he won the arbitration after all), just to introduce his connection to Elon Musk and Tesla. This connection seems an unavoidable thread through his work at Fisker Automotive which would have directly competed with Tesla.  **Chapter 1: Fisker Automotive (the first one)**  Henrik Fisker created his first car company. Named it after himself (not a glaring red flag since it’s his first company, but remember this for later). Created a car – the Fisker Karma – that was beautiful, but an engineering disaster.   The most publicized issue was batteries that would catch on fire. But this wasn’t the only problem. “Pressure on engineers to stay faithful to Henrik Fisker’s original design, even when flaws emerged that undercut the Karma’s performance and potential fixes would add millions in cost.” \[2\]. These flaws included an exhaust system for the hybrid ICE that pointed forwards. The Exhaust. Pointed. Forward. And Fisker wouldn’t let anyone change it.  “On more than one occasion, Fisker asked suppliers to hand-build certain components for the Karma, which increased the cost as much as threefold” \[2\]  “The company churned through three battery suppliers in three years. As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts ‘not necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price…but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.’” \[3\]  “As the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn’t even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.” \[3\]  “’Beneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,’ said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.” \[2\]  “From 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.” \[2\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023).   This was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That’s got to hurt.  So, man that’s a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let’s see…  **Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**  His next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn’t it be cool if you \[Fisker\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL…VLF…VL…VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the “F” for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \[4\]  As promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \[4\]  Q: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?  A: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.  Q: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?  A: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.  It’s a short back and forth, but there’s a lot in there to unpack. I just don’t have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn’t sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure.   Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems.   “We have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world’s longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.” \[4\].   Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware.   He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.  “We also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that’s pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.” \[4\]  He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I’ll refer to his “vaporcars”.   **Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)**   Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We’re going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates.   In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017.   So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:  “It’s mainly been dismissed for automotive because it’s very expensive to make, it doesn’t have the power, and it doesn’t work below zero,” said Fisker. “We have cracked all three of these areas.” \[5\]  In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]  “This isn’t just a lab test; we’ve actually built the batteries,” \[5\]  They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:  “To date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved—Dyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson—have demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.” \[7\]  From the same article: “But it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.” \[7\]  Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. “For now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. “We are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.” He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.” \[8\]  By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\].   2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?  **Chapter 4: Foxconn**  File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled “Pear” concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of “Apple” in the press? This truly baffles me.   **Chapter 5: I’m Exhausted**  I’m so tired of writing this, I’d be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik’s wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there’s an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the Chief Technology Officer (who is not a board member).   **Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**  I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla’s declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that’s at the lot down the road.  &amp;#x200B;  Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can’t decide what value they add other than the name on the front.   &amp;#x200B;  As always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice.

Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems.   “We have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world’s longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.” \[4\].   Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware.   He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.  “We also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that’s pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.” \[4\]  He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I’ll refer to his “vaporcars”.   **Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)**   Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We’re going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates.   In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017.   So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:  “It’s mainly been dismissed for automotive because it’s very expensive to make, it doesn’t have the power, and it doesn’t work below zero,” said Fisker. “We have cracked all three of these areas.” \[5\]  In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]  “This isn’t just a lab test; we’ve actually built the batteries,” \[5\]  They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:  “To date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved—Dyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson—have demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.” \[7\]  From the same article: “But it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.” \[7\]  Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. “For now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. “We are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.” He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.” \[8\]  By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\].   2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?  **Chapter 4: Foxconn**  File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled “Pear” concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of “Apple” in the press? This truly baffles me.   **Chapter 5: I’m Exhausted**  I’m so tired of writing this, I’d be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik’s wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there’s an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the CTO (who is not a board member).   **Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**  I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla’s declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that’s at the lot down the road.  Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can’t decide what value they add other than the name on the front.   &amp;#x200B;  As always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice.

And yes of course I'll add the obligatory ""this is not investment advice but rather my own opinion based on publicly available information. Carefully consider your own investment objectives and risk factors before investing.""  I don’t know about you folks, but I guess after a few down days and a $224/share avg I needed some reassurance that our GME will indeed take off one day. So, I dug deep into the memory banks and recalled one important supply-demand ratio from my investment finance classes, namely the Turnover Ratio (TRO).   Do you ever notice how some stocks seem to soar suddenly, often with little or no news? While other stocks can receive ongoing great news and hardly move higher at all? Well, my smooth brained apes…as you can imagine it’s all about supply and demand.    At the end of the day what makes a stock rise in value? If you answered “more buyers than sellers” than you win a banana! So how do we compare one stock to another and determine how changes in demand can affect the upward (or downward movement) of the price?   A quick definition check:   10-D AVG VOL (10-day average volume): Reflects more current trading activity, expressed as average daily volume over the last 10 trading days   FL (Float): We’re all well versed on this one, but just in case float is “the number of shares outstanding, or all the shares there are for that company, minus what is owned by insiders and what the company is holding back (treasury stock). In a nutshell, associate the float with the supply of shares available to be traded at any given time by the public.”   So with those definitions in mind, I decided to pull Yahoo Finance’s Top 25 most active stocks for today, March 16th and dive right in. Most active stocks are listed in order of today’s volume. I then added additional columns for, you guessed it, 10-D AVG VOL and FL.   This now sets us up for the simple TURNOVER RATIO (TRO) calculation, which is 10-D AVG VOL / FL.   If the float is very large relative to the average volume (lots of shares out there to be bought and sold in relationship to the average volume) we would see a low turnover ratio and thus an onrush of buyers would not move the price much (think Ford stock)   However, if the float is low relative to the average volume (a lot of people wanting very few available shares,) a sudden rush of buyers could move the price of a stock dramatically (think Gamestop).  So how does our precious little GME rank. Have a look and see for yourself!   GME’s TRO is 93%. Ninety-Three Per Cent!!!   That's 25% higher than the next highest security (SNDL), and a whopping 86% higher than the entire group average!  This essentially means 930 out of every 1,000 tradeable shares of GME have changed hands every single day over the last ten days.   This tells us GME is a VERY volatile a stock that will trade violently given an imbalance in supply or demand either to the up or downside.    So let me ask you this: Did you sell your stock recently? Did you? What about you? I sure as hell didn’t? So how the fuck is this possible? Easy. This is exactly what all the brilliant DD’s before me have already confirmed: There are synthetic GME shares out the whazooo being traded ALL DAY LONG. With short and naked-short interest estimated anywhere between 2-5x float we are about to witness a historic imbalance play out before us.   My fellow apes and ape-ettes, we are patiently waiting for liftoff on the “right” side of this very equation. All we need to do is HOLD and continue to keep this Turnover Ratio in our favor. The greedy idiots that decided to double and triple down on GME’s demise WILL be held accountable someday very soon.   And don’t forget to ensure your 5-pt harnesses are buckled up tight. When this thing takes off we’ll be pulling G-forces that’ll peel our eyelids back and leave a stream of diarrhea behind us.    See you in the Oort Cloud!

Your critiques and judgements are HIGHLY sought after by me; did I do enough DD? Was there more things I could have talked about? Lemme know. Lengthy post so I hope it helps and you enjoy...  &amp;#x200B;  NOTE: I am NOT a professional investor and this is not meant to be professional investment advice. I always HIGHLY suggest you do your own DD and research yourself, and hopefully you will come to the same conclusion that I have. I like the stock... I hope you do too...  Current analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value ""on the street."" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...  First let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...  &amp;#x200B;  \* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)  \* They are NOT a ""phone company.""  \* They are NOT, however, totally ""out of the phone business."" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.  &amp;#x200B;  This last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...  &amp;#x200B;  Though BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:  ""As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.""  This last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?  &amp;#x200B;  Okay, so India... It's a country on the ""other side of the world,"" why should we care?  &amp;#x200B;  It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...  Though BB DID ""officially"" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name ""BlackBerry Mobile.""  &amp;#x200B;  Now, what does this have to do with the ""validity"" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:  A few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.  Looks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!  &amp;#x200B;  Enough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB ""liking the stock"") for a minute...  BlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...  In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!  Sheesh, I didn't know that!  Here's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:  ""38,000+ patents  18 major development centers in 7 countries  I wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.  &amp;#x200B;  NINETY...  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  You gotta be %$%&amp;# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??  I'll let you ponder that point for a minute...  &amp;#x200B;  So, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home?   But wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?  Well, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:  ""which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.""  CARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!  &amp;#x200B;  Now, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...  Articles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...  Ha ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford’s current technology systems and touch screens.  So what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.  Two things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):  One, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership ""unique"" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.  Two, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since ""the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.""  So in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...  READ BETWEEN THE LINES....  &amp;#x200B;  Finally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...  As of June 2020, ""its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today."" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)  What sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... ""Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry® QNX® software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.""  &amp;#x200B;  Shit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...  One thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their ""day in the sun."" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...  ""BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.""  This is freakin' HUGE... ""BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees."" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)  &amp;#x200B;  March brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating ""BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery’s Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.""  to the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.  Add to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.  &amp;#x200B;  However, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...  All in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.  &amp;#x200B;  (Please note; all direct quotes from sources include """" so you know I'm not paraphrasing, but including actual research data given word for word from the original sources."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9557323|public|confidence|self|My first DD post about BlackBerry...|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5x5o5/my_first_dd_post_about_blackberry/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-03-16|FORD

Not a lot though, because I'm a smooth brain ape who spent too many bananas at the strip club. This isn't investment advice. I'm just an autist who thinks Ford is an undervalued long play at ~$13/share and here's why...  --------  1) They sell the F150, the #1 selling truck to apes in the USA (with an EV version coming out next year)   2) They are acquiring large partnerships with companies like Rivian and VW  3) The skateboard platform is scalable and well thought out for EV implementation across multiple vehicles, reducing overhead costs  4) They are coming out with a new, light weight, smaller than the Ranger, truck called the Maverick. It is potentially going to be EV  5) They are bringing the Ranger Raptor to the USA, which will sell like hot bananas because every ape will want one  6) They just released the Ford Bronco  7) They are releasing a new V8 F150 Raptor that will be 750 HP that uses the GT500 motor  8) They just released the all electric Mach E, which is a direct competitor to the Tesla Model Y  9) They're investing with VW in Argo AI, a self driving technology platform  10) They are investing in 3d printing car parts for their automotive sandbox  11) They're investing in Solid Power, to put ASSB solid state batteries in their future EV's  12) The Mach E is fully eligible for the $7500 tax rebate, Tesla has exhausted their tax rebate  13) Ford cannot hardly keep Mach E's or Bronco's on the lot for longer than a day or two at most. My retarded opinion is that they'll have even more trouble producing EV trucks fast enough to even see a sales lot.   ----------  Ford Market Cap: 51 bn  TSLA Market Cap: 639 bn  ---------  Ford Stock Price: ~$13  TSLA Stock Price: ~$695|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9549444|public|confidence|self|Why I think Ford is going to the moon|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5nrh1/why_i_think_ford_is_going_to_the_moon/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-03-15|FORD

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.  # **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction. ***** &gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower. ***** &gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month. ***** &gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday. ***** &gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023. ***** &gt; # Fed ahead &gt; “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.” ***** &gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy. ***** &gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy. ***** &gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks. ***** &gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year. ***** &gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans. ***** &gt; “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM. ***** &gt; “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.” ***** &gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12. ***** &gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals &gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%. ***** &gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios. ***** &gt; “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors. ***** &gt; “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.” ***** &gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals. ***** &gt; “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.” ***** &gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%. ***** &gt; “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’” ***** &gt; “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.” ***** &gt; Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year. ***** &gt; “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said. ***** &gt; # Bond volatility &gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday. ***** &gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed. ***** &gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending. ***** &gt; The program expires March 31. ***** &gt; “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said. ***** &gt; “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.” ***** &gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile. ***** &gt; “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.” *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fkwT5RT.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MuJ7SlC.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lQiMjAN.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hvH8uj8.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ojOPNgp.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OtOIN5B.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AUXbpnZ.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sptpE1X.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hb2eNGo.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13  &gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.  &gt; March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?  &gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.  &gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”  &gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.  *****  &gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March  &gt; We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.  &gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.  &gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.  &gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.  &gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Versatile Outperformers  &gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**  &gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # FedEx Corp. $270.20 **FedEx Corp.

Put it on**.**  I'm your host Brother Luminous and **I want to start this out by saying I'm not a professional, I am not giving financial advice and well you shouldn't listen to anything I say.  Please let me know if I am wrong. I can take it.  Please check our work its.**   Canoo Inc. AKA $GOEV is an EV automaker whose claim to fame is developing a highly customizable electric skateboard chassis allowing it to quickly adapt vehicle designs to specific applications with a high degree of customizability. They seek to break the mold by pushing design boundaries while maximizing utility and advancing new concepts in vehicle ownership through subscription based models of vehicle financing and fleet management.  Canoo Inc also excels at punishing the visionary longs as you must wait for 3 months outside the temple of Zen before they let you in No more suffering GOEV only tendies and gainz posting now.   # Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell  Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than weekly Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.  This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money this weekend and BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.  For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.   # Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.  [BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.  &amp;#x200B;  |u/basketfragrant brought this to my attention|Canoo ChadTruk|^(ford F-150)|Cyber.. truck?| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Payload**|1800 - What engine?

In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.  I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. **Trend Reversal.**   # No Real  ETF Yet, straight unconcerned.  &amp;#x200B;  |/u/bagtf3 reported this.|GOEV|WKHS|FSR|NIO|RIDE| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |\# ETFs|3|38|13|75|14| |\#ETF Held shares|114K|13m|7.1m|49.7m|5.6m|  After being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on ""ETF shorting"".

Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.

Roblox is not a game nor a game developer.   Roblox is a platform with both development tools and a social media aspect linked to it...

The comparison makes no sense and maybe people are trying to spread this FUD to lower their own point of entry to the stock but there is a reason why ARK bought 500k shares.   Roblox should be compared to Facebook and other social platforms first and foremost. Then take a look at user growth in a website like Codecademy ... These are more accurate comparisons.   People and news outlets comparing Roblox to a game developer that spits out one major title every 5-10 years and hopes they can retain their online multiplayer user base are not the same thing and do not look like they ever will be.

I can assure you however, that at this price I am confident RBLX is a great long term hold and if the price were to drop my only reaction would be to grab more shares.

Steven Sanchez, CEO of EVmo said, ""The future of mobility is electric. Tesla is an obvious choice and we are excited to be one of the first Tesla rideshare fleet partners in the US that will deploy electric vehicles rather than gasoline-powered vehicles, for services like Uber and Lyft. Our EV commitment provides outsized climate benefits. The explosive growth in the gig economy and evidence that it's cann ibalizing more climate-friendly mass transit makes it important for EVmo to go all electric. There are a small number of electric vehicles used by drivers, yet electric vehicle adoption is on the rise. We recognize that the timing is right to go electric. The environmental and emission reduction benefits are high for electric vehicle usage by gig economy drivers and we want to be a catalyst for that transition.""     In recent press, rideshare companies and carmakers are increasing the number of electric vehicles used in the transportation industry. Both Uber and Lyft announced they are going 100% electric vehicles on their platform. General Motors plans to completely phase out vehicles using internal combustion engines by 2035, More than half of GM's capital spending and product development team wil l be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs. Ford, VW and Volvo are making a serious play in electric as well. But it's Tesla that is the unparalleled EV market leader in the world that makes the product such an excellent strategic choice.     Further, Mr. Sanchez stated, ""We are confident our all electric fleet will drive a successful business model for the future, becoming the first to exclusively deploy electric vehicles (EVs) for the gig economy will position us as a leader in the space and is a natural evolution from our mixed energy fleet. As previously announced, the company deployed 40 electric vehicles (EVs) in December of 2020, as part of a car-sharing program in LA. Since then, we acquired 12 EV's in February of 2021, and discovered there was a strong demand for them . We were encouraged that they rented quickly. Drivers have given great reviews, and are finding the charging easy. Not only did they save money on gas, which is their biggest cost, they received an additional $0.50 directly from a $1.00 rider surcharge for every Uber Green trip completed. Drivers also found that there was sufficient range and ample charging stations in the LA market where the vehicles were launched. And most importantly, it did not limit the number of rides or deliveries. To diversify our EV fleet, we tested the market with Hyundai Kona Electric units, which offers solid tech and safety features at only $10 more a day for drivers, it more than covered the gas savings."" Sanchez continued, ""By EVmo's acquisition and deployment of electric vehicles, drivers did not have higher up-front costs compared to them having to purchase EV's. We have 10 Tesla Model 3's and more Hyundai Kona's being delivered in the next few weeks and there are plans to establish our EV fleet f urther through the ordering of more Tesla Model 3's. We plan on using future funding and resources in a way that supports our EV future plans.     Sanchez continued, ""The Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus is highest rated in every category. It offers Tesla prestige at a lower price, is most technologically advanced and is best in class on range, performance and handling. Equally important is the Tesla supercharger network access. With a range at 263 miles, Tesla Model 3 makes it affordable and profitable for both the driver and us. The drivers get the benefits of the gas savings; plus, they can drive at a higher level both Uber and Lyft's platform, where they can earn more money.""   EVmo, Inc. (formerly YayYo, Inc.)     EVmo, Inc. bridges the gap between rideshare drivers in need of a suitable vehicle and rideshare companies that depend on attracting and keeping drivers. Rideshare Rental uniquely supports drivers in higher and lower economic categories with innovative vehicle offerings and programs. Rideshare Rental is a leading provider of rental vehicles to drivers in the gig economy.     Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rideshare Car Rentals, LLC, is an online rideshare vehicle booking platform created to service the rideshar ing, delivery gig economy and the logistics market place, which includes both our owned-fleet vehicles and third party fleet vehicles. Distinct Cars LLC, our other wholly-owned subsidiary, maintains a fleet of vehicles that are commercially available for rent by gig-economy drivers and the logistics market place.   Rideshare Rental provides SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases about our financial performance on the investor relations section of our website (EVmo.com)     About Tesla     Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn't need to compromise to drive electric - that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.     Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world's first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up - Model S - which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world's expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk's ""Secret Master Plan,"" in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever - Tesla Semi - which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.   Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla's safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.     To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla's automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 - a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.     And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy prod uction. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful - that's the future we want.

Different from all other  insurance companies in the space because they do insurance based on how much you drive. So people that drive less than 12,000 miles a year would save money using this. Great for high populated areas such as New York and San Fran.   They are currently only running in 8 states so a huge growth opportunity when they expand. They have been beaten down a lot with this sell off and are below SPAC offering.   Revenue and Competition:  Their market cap is getting close to 1 billion with over 100 mill in revenue. Compare it to their competitor Lemonade which does different types of insurance they have comparable  revenue and growth but LMND market cap is 5 times that of Metro but Metro has more room to grow cause of the expansion of their market which is 42 more states and possibly out of the country.   They also have a deal with Ford on new vehicles that they signed last year in December to help get their name out their and their tech is actually pretty good.   They are also a SaaS company that can sell their tech to other insurance companies to use with the basis of tracking miles and calculating your insurance that way.   They are beat down just like their competitors LMND and Root but are way undervalued compared to them with way more growth opportunities and are different than any other insurance company.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9466143|public|confidence|self|Metromile (MILE) great value play at this point|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0uohz/metromile_mile_great_value_play_at_this_point/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-03-09|FORD

The stated goal of the ETF is to track the internet and internet fueled stock picks. He hopes to capitalize on the internet’s insights early, so that when (not if) a future GME happens, the ETF will get in early. However, the ETF has been falling since it launched at 9:30. As of this posting it’s down nearly 4% since IPO. Additionally, the ETF’s three largest holdings are twitter, Draft Kings, and Ford. I’m not particularly interested in any of those companies, but i do find the prospect of getting in on the next GME early appetizing. So, what does Wall Street Bets think?

Yes, you heard that right.   1.	GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles.   2.	GM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.  3.	GM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.  4.	GM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.  5.	GM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge!   6.	Apple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.  7.	Famous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.  8.	President Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.  9.	Chip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.  10.	Newly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).  Megabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below.

all,  Here to talk about a company with alot of potential that isn’t GME or RKT. I know, I know, sad and im retarded and should just buy those stocks  Lordstown motors is IMO a heavily overlooked and undervalued EV stock that has not had its fair chance to flourish yet.   -They will be the first electric pickup truck to market -They have a 600 acre factory right here in the USA - A partnership with Camping world ( I know lame but distribution= 🚀 ) -100k preorders -45k price tag on the pickup after government incentives (52k without) -Backing by GM   All with only a 3.4B market cap.  If only half of the none binding preorders got filled(which is unlikely because the average order size is 600 and you need to set up charging stations for all those trucks at there destinations and that takes time and planning) that would be 2.6B in revenue. Almost the market cap currently. The orders will keep coming and the technology will be proven.    Analyst are attacking this stock for reasons I havent figured out yet. Morgan Stanley downgraded there price target due to not believing in Hub motor technology. How often do you think a guy at morgan stanley works on cars!? One of his concerns was running coolant lines to the wheels.... You know like where your brake lines go, and your wheel speed sensor harness, and vacuum lines... this guy had never even changed a flat tire.  They are also now reprinting old articles of a very early “skateboard”(thats what lordestown calls the underlying design) on fire. Shit happens, the car was so early at that point it didnt even have the pickup body it comes with at that time. Also thats why they do these test. Go on there twitter and watch the test they put the hub motors through and the rest of the truck.  Another fear is ford, does anyone even know any other type of ford besides an F-150? So ford is gonna make and electric truck to compete against the only thing keeping them in business?! Im not saying ford wont have a nice electric truck but I do think they arent a good long play.  Steve Burns the CEO has entered the Lordstown Endurance into a 290 mile Baja race in Mexico to prove the concept.   The race is in April, Earnings are next week, the moon this year.

This is not financial advice and I am NOT a financial advisor! I just really like this stock.   Quick history lesson for you apes, Microvision is an old company, older than you (probably). These mamma jammas have been slanging since ‘96. What business have they been in you may be wondering? The future mother fucker. VR, Augmented Reality, Laser Imaging. These people grew up in the ‘90’s watching shit like Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, The Matrix. They watched these futuristic films and thought to get ahead of the curve and get into the business of future tech early.   Microvision is headquartered in Washington, and as a tech company that’s a big deal. That means they aren't an overvalued silicon value trust fund baby. To viciously oversimplify what this company is vested in; their tech is applied to display applications ( Projections / VR), sensing (LiDAR), and Display and Sensing ( ??Augmented Reality?? ).   The only application of their tech I give a single fuck about is the automotive sensing. Sure VR is great for when I’m watching my Brazzers and I really want to feel like I’m getting laid since I am too afraid to go outside or talk to people in the real world, but on a large scale economic evaluation the VR industry is a moot point.   $TSLA (Shameless papa Elon Simp) is arguably the best current automotive manufacturer on the planet. Every other automotive manufacturer is looking to take some pointers from them and start down their own path of autonomous driving. When it comes to autonomous driving there are 3 different types of technology that can be used to achieve this. Camera sensors, Radar sensors, and LiDAR sensors. Please go through this informative piece to educate yourself on autonomous driving you silly mongoloid.   [https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars](https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars).   TL&amp;DR : Of the three major sensors, LiDAR is the best in terms of quality of sensing, but the drawback to this technology is the cost of use. When it comes to LiDAR there are two major types of sensor arrays, ones that spin and move a bunch and ones that don’t. Can you guess which ones would be more preferred by an automobile manufacturer? \*\*\* hint it doesn't move \*\*\*  [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range)  Microvision has released a statement that it is now able to build a stationary LiDAR sensor around a sub-$1000 price point and this sensor will meet all of the specifications set by car manufacturers.   [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15)  On Feb 15 Ford dissolved their stake in a different LiDAR company, Velodyne. Coincidence ? I think not. This tells us two very important things about this tech and the direction of the automotive industry. First, automotive manufacturers see the value in LiDAR as the technology of choice for autonomous vehicles. Next, they are positioning themselves well ahead of the curve to be seeded in the correct positions to win.

On April 4, 2021 automotive manufacturers will  finally be able to get their hands on these sensors and (assuming they meet all OEM requirements like they already said they can) MVIS is more than well positioned to be the LiDAR company of choice for all automotive manufacturers looking to enter the autonomous driving industry. As manufacturers they have already shown their investments into this technology will come early and fast. It is impossible for anyone to predict if the company will be acquired or if they will lease/partner up, but all the information points to the rapid success of MVIS in the automotive sensors industry.

So, I've noticed a pattern: the government has a ton of fucking money - they even print the money, follow the money, anticipate the money, stonks only go up, and if you choose the right stock, stonks go Way up, like private utility bills during a disaster in Texas, or Ford and GM when a Boomer president funds an EV renaissance.  The president/the current administration has vowed to replace The Entire U.S. Government Fleet Of Vehicles, all 650,000 of them, with Electric Vehicles:  ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Monday vowed to replace  the U.S. government’s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric  models as the new administration shifts its focus toward clean-energy.""  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos/biden-vows-to-replace-u-s-government-fleet-with-electric-vehicles-idUSKBN29U2LW](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos/biden-vows-to-replace-u-s-government-fleet-with-electric-vehicles-idUSKBN29U2LW)  The current administration has a Make America Great Again plan. I mean, Made In America plan:  ""Biden’s comprehensive manufacturing and innovation strategy **will marshall the resources of the federal government in ways that we have  not seen since World War II**. Together, the following six lines of effort  will remake American manufacturing and innovation **so that the future is  made in America by all of America’s workers:**  &amp;#x200B;  1. **BUY AMERICAN. Make “Buy American”** **Real and Make a $400 billion Procurement Investment** that  ... will power  new demand for American products, materials, and services ... 2. **MAKE IT IN AMERICA.** **Retool and Revitalize American Manufacturers**,  with a particular focus on smaller manufacturers ... 3. **INNOVATE IN AMERICA.** **Make a New $300 Billion Investment in** Research and Development (R&amp;D) and Breakthrough Technologies — from **electric vehicle technology ...**  ""  [https://joebiden.com/made-in-america/](https://joebiden.com/made-in-america/)  It's Boomer Time.  So, the Biden administration wants to Make America Great Again, and bring us back to the good ol' days before segregation, where ice cream cones were a nickel, and muscle cars were an icon of the era. Cool. Edit: Segregation is \_not\_ cool. But muscle cars are. Kinda. I mean, I'd drive a 2006 CTS-V if I could afford one. Anyway, cool.  I can think of two particular American auto manufacturers which were popular at the time:  Ford, and  GM  Yes there is Tesla, but Biden is a boomer, or maybe even older. And I forget what comes after two anyway, so Ford, GM, and whatever comes after.  And what's more, is Ford and GM are already cozy with the U.S. government, meaning that both have already received either large government contracts or/and bailouts.  And President Biden is a bona fide G-Man, and good ol' boys tend to do business together.  Case in point, I did not know this until writing this DD, but oh look, Oshkosh Truck has the USPS contract to build all the new Electric Vehicles, and who is sourcing them materials? fucking Ford.:  ""When asked if the ""sub-systems"" are engines and  might Ford have a piece of the contract as an engine supplier, Quigley  said, “The vehicle will be built from the ground up by Oshkosh to  fulfill the unique needs of the postal service. We will share more  information about the supply base in the future. At this time, we are  not at liberty to discuss our supply chain for this program.”  Oshkosh did not deny Ford would play a role as a supplier.   Ford declined to comment.""

Cool. And GM?  ""... General Motors’ plan \[is\] to offer 30 new EVs globally by 2025.""  Nice. But their website has some gay ass javascript. Or jquery. Choose your front-end nerd-fight - [https://imgur.com/a/G9Qg22t](https://imgur.com/a/G9Qg22t) To copy that quote I had to pull it from the page's source, so Puts on GM developers. But GM doesn't make websites, they make automobiles, so, I have mixed feelings right now, like when I was 5 and a man tickled me in the airport bathroom.  [https://www.gm.com/commitments/electrification.html](https://www.gm.com/commitments/electrification.html)  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/)  What's more, is GM doesn't just want to sell you an EV, they want to sell you the gas, I mean power, too.  [https://www.automobilemag.com/news/gm-evgo-add-2700-charging-stations-by-2025/](https://www.automobilemag.com/news/gm-evgo-add-2700-charging-stations-by-2025/)  Even Teslas will be able to charge. And GM &amp; EVgo will be able to charge Tesla drivers:  ""Adding more Tesla-compatible charging stations is part of a larger plan  to add 2700 stations to cities in the United States over the next five  years.""

Not because you want to drive your Tesla from San Francisco to The Midwest where rent is still affordable, dummy. EV charging stations are important because the Biden administration is ALSO printing a fat fucking 1.7T stimmy contract for EV charging stations too! (and other things):  ""Biden's $1.7 trillion clean energy plan  includes more than 500,000 new EV plugs nationwide by the end of 2030,  along with new tax credits and incentives for EV purchases.""  [https://mashable.com/article/biden-electric-vehicle-charging-adoption/](https://mashable.com/article/biden-electric-vehicle-charging-adoption/)  All part of the Biden Clean Energy Plan here:  [https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)  Why else do I think Ford or/and GM will get EV and EV-charging-station government stimmy contracts? Because Ford and GM have UNIONS. And Boomers fucking Love Unions, and according to the administration's Clean Energy Plan, any company which has a union, or will form one, seems likely to receive Uncle Sam's 'rich uncle' money:  * **Auto Industry: Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry**, domestic auto supply chains, and auto  infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging  stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the  21st century; **and invest in U.S. auto workers to ensure their jobs are  good jobs with a choice to join a union.** * **Transit:** Provide every American city with 100,000 or more  residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options through flexible **federal investments** ...  Yes, it's the lowest bidder which gets contracts, but, they Have to be American through-and-through, and, probably have to be a Union shop, which certainly narrows down the choices of companies even eligible to bid.  So, let's take this from the top:  Government owns the money printers.  Government gives out stimmy in the form of government contracts.  Biden is replacing all government fleet vehicles with EVs; about 650,000:  [https://www.government-fleet.com/301786/federal-vs-state-local-fleets](https://www.government-fleet.com/301786/federal-vs-state-local-fleets)  Biden is a Boomer.  Boomers love their Ford and GM brands.  Biden is a G-man.  Ford and GM have already gotten the G. And like a horny ex, Big Government prooobably wants to give them The Big G again -- possibly at the same time, e.g. multiple/simultaneous contracts, (giggity), because EVs, EV infra, and unions are sexy.  Also, Ford is \_already\_ a supplier to the USPS EV stimmy contract.  And now, the government needs to charge all these fucking granola EVs, but there's not enough infra.  Well, there's stimmy for charging stations in this admin too:  ""The Biden Admin is also printing stimmy contracts for EV \_chargers\_, 500,000, by 2030.""  And, GM has a kinky new partner who has been working out, EVgo, which has already built out EV-charging infrastructure, and is also going public Q2, 2021. And, I don't want to speculate, but if EVgo unionized, President Biden would have to worry about more than just ice cream stains on his suit pants... and EVgo would have to worry about what to do with all of rich Uncle Biden/Uncle Sam's money. -- What I mean is, GM might also be able to be a part of the EV charging contract, like Ford is a part of the USPS EV contract, or maybe GM gets an infra contract, and is EVgo's sugar daddy.  Again, I've noticed a pattern: the government has a ton of fucking money - they even print the money - shit they even own the money printers, follow the money, anticipate the money, stonks only go up, and if you choose the right stock, stonks go Way up, like private utility bills during a disaster in Texas, or Ford and GM when a Boomer president funds an EV renaissance.  Tell me, on a scale of 1 to Q, how retarded am I  TL;DR  Boomer President likes Boomer Cars  [https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/pursuits/motors/exploring-joe-bidens-enviable-classic-car-collection/](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/pursuits/motors/exploring-joe-bidens-enviable-classic-car-collection/)  Biden is replacing all government vehicles with electric vehicle models, and is already using Boomer Brand auto maker Ford - and Oshkosh Truck, to do so.  GM is next, with their kinky stripper boyfriend - EVgo. Manufacturing EVs and building out the EV charging infra as well, which the Biden administration has a hard-on for -- building EV infra to support the USPS/Government Fleet EV makeover.  I hate Boomer stocks..... but Boomer admin is giving the big-stimmy to Boomer companies. Buy boomer stock, get boomer stimmy money.  Don't fight Big G, just let it happen.  Ford and GM  , BACK to the Moon!  Also, how retarded am I, please. On a scale of 1 - Q  Edit: This is my Javascript gripe: [https://imgur.com/a/G9Qg22t](https://imgur.com/a/G9Qg22t) happens every time I click text on GM's website. Gay.  Also, I learned about the Silent Generation -&gt; that's Biden; not a Boomer. And my grandma. I'm calling her today for money, I mean,I'm calling to ask her what it was like to grow up through civil rights and Vietnam and all that.

not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F. So, proceed on your own risk...)  **⚠️ERECTION ALERT!⚠️** Before reading this post, make sure that you are wearing sweatpants/Bras because you're guaranteed a sustained penile/nipple erection throughout your reading. So, Don't embarrass yourself in public...  Before we start, This DD has been inspired by the original $GME short squooze prophet -/JeffAmazon-. I trust this retard because he proved to me that he's a market clairvoyant(metaphorically speaking). If you are a new WSB ape(retard:WSB ancient slang), -/JeffAmazon- is like the kid who shot the Damn Daniel meme(Daniel being DFV and the camera guy is -/JeffAmazon-), nobody knows who he is, but he was as important, if not more important than Daniel...  **You can check his profile for his DD**  My humble street Cred: When $BB was undervalued (\~7$), I wrote a [DD(click me)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb6exy/the_fallen_berry_will_be_reincarnated_as_a_bb/) literally preMoon Launch and made the Forest grump BB meme! So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!  **So Let's start!**  Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!  I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD 🇺🇸 🦅.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&amp;D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**  # FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)  Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.  As The Verge's Sean O’Kane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**  For more on Mach E comparison to Tesla cars: [Link 1](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/23322283-rd-barris/5534036-reviews-of-ford-mustang-mach-e-show-tesla-no-secret-sauce) Link 2  # What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?  **Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**  Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.  Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.  Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it’s averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won’t be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it’s off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).  Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven’t had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV’s first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.  **What about international production and sales?**  Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)  **What about Asia?**  Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)  **What about government support in production?**  Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker’s plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)  **Innovation and Technology:**  Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford’s transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford’s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.  **What other EV models are they working on?**  in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.  # Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)  Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.  $Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple  (Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)  TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X  NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)  GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X  F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X  **(Important part starts here)**  As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.  If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.  If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.  Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**🦅** after a forest fire.  **TLDR:**  1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **✅** **🇺🇸**  2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **✅**  3- Have the government support. **✅**  4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **✅**  5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **✅**  **MY Price Target: 110$ TICKER:$F**  Position: 500 calls 17$ expires at 21 JAN 2022 (TICKER:$F)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9322984|public|confidence|self|EV Play: Buying leap calls on America for the next big 2021 play PT.1|15.0|[]|0.9|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsh9fh/ev_play_buying_leap_calls_on_america_for_the_next/|some_ads|7.0||||||||1614290626.0|2.0|||||||2021-02-25|FORD

taking off. BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I’ve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife’s boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.  Listen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.  Last few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol’ titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that’s just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.  BB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it’s working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China’s google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV’s and use BB’s QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they’ll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry’s QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that’s just the beginning. No we won’t see profit this March because it is yet to boom.   another product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it’s only one of their products. It’s a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.  IVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It’s basically an App store installed in AV’s, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don’t fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.  This is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.  DISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that’s why I yolo’d 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.  Also, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what’s on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.  Positions: 500 @ 12  Edit: Thanks a lot for the rewards retards, but shouldn’t you just buy more BB?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9313304|public|confidence|self|$BB’s Time Has Come|13.0|[]|0.9|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrznso/bbs_time_has_come/|some_ads|7.0||||||||1614247486.0|1.0|||||||2021-02-25|FORD

When  I used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007, 8, 9, it  was well known that most people trying to start studios fail MISERABLY.  There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They'd have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn't want to make their living recording cool  music all day?  I was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I'll never forget.  They told me, ""you don't make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \*selling the dream of opening a  studio.""\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people's home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.  Let's  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There's going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house &amp; senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that's too much for my small brain. To try and \*time\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it's a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don't have the  brain for it.  One thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn't  \*matter\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn't \*matter\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.  We  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered ""not essential"" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.  I am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I'm more sharing this to  get criticism &amp; ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.  **TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**  Reasons:  **1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**  **2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**  **3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government &amp; pushing up the demand &amp; price for copper.**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9308398|public|confidence|self|Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?|0.0|[]|0.58|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrsylv/thoughts_on_copper_as_an_inflation_infrastructure/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-02-25|FORD

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term 🚀🚀, long term = big ⬇️. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all.   Before I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards  Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.  First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&amp;D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.  Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second.  Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later. Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above).  Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'. Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong. Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more.   Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood ähem ähem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.  There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish.  For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain.  However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.  So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&amp;D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today.   In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history.   So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a 🌈🐻 I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.  Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday  Feel free to call me a 🌈🐻 in the comments ☺️💋"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9305640|public|confidence|self|A 🌈🐻 perspective on $TSLA|1.0|[]|0.73|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrne4v/a_perspective_on_tsla/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'EWZ2EPsx77As-HGvQJ-rvmyE5NTGHRCK9iI6UOvIaig', 'resolutions': [{'height': 76, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a126e210746d7127ec31145b9a5bc241cae0a8af', 'width': 108}, {'height': 152, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=908e2ee5c39b69db1307bd2f032438b019a854fd', 'width': 216}, {'height': 225, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c439b6ba60b3c5e46148cbcb56595cd6c97fd2b', 'width': 320}, {'height': 451, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f67e8c8b3932f3f54dd88e8248ff15c60eaafd62', 'width': 640}, {'height': 676, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f83c340b853dc854a22a03b00b9263933e78bc5', 'width': 960}, {'height': 761, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f11e1327d9076f52eb2dc36f972835e0ea127947', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=582a592c1a84bb1d370d57638235e88f96eefeef', 'width': 3290}, 'variants': {}}]}||||1614206139.0||||||||2021-02-24|FORD

is not advice I have no idea what I'm talking about I went to a D-tier state school and got a C in accounting II. Please do your own research and don't come knocking at my door when you don't make gamestop money on Ford. Also this is my first DD after lurking for years so please be as mean as possible. Edited for formatting.   So we all know that EVs are the future and that someday we are all going to be driven around in Teslas, so you could dismiss the legacy automakers as boomer shit stuck in the past, but I think that the market has over-corrected for this and overlooked a couple things:  * Ford has been stealthily morphing into a tech-centric automaker * Ford's fundamentals are still really solid * Ford's new management team gets it  I'll go into detail into each below. Here are some ford financials from Yahoo finance to set up some context: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/key-statistics?p=F   * Forward P/E: 10.53 * P/S: 0.36 * Mkt Cap: $46B   **Factor 1: Ford understands where the auto market is going.** A couple years ago, when Ford announced that they were going to stop producing sedans for the US market, I thought they were smoking crack. Sedans still represent a thicc market segment. But nah, they kept around the high margin trucks and suvs and let GM, Honda, Toyota have the dwindling US sedan market so that they could focus their resources on developing next-gen products. And some of those are finally here and they are legit actually pretty good.   The Mach-E: $42k, 300mi range, 3.5 second 0-60. Fast charging. Not quite Tesla good yet but damn close. This is a legit viable product, and you don't get any of the Tesla customer service issues. If you factor in the $7500 federal tax credit, it's cheaper than a Model Y.   Electric F150 coming soon: best selling truck in America getting an EV version. It's going to be good too. The legit info on this car is coming later this year most likely and it's going to be solid. They've already demoed it pulling a million pounds (which is BS because it was on rails so doesn't count - so we don't get a real tow cap number yet but we know it's yoked). And it's going to look like a real truck so they can capture the whole toxic-masculinity-but-my-wife-cares-about-climate-change market.  They own part of Rivian. Rivian gonna be dope af and if they can leverage Ford's manufacturing experience they could potentially skip a large part of the painful production ramp-up that Tesla went through. And Ford gets paid in the process and gets access to the tech Rivian develops.   Tesla's PE is like fucking 200. That's how wall street values tech companies and innovation companies. Share price is gonna go ape once the analysts figure out that Ford is a tech company that is merely funded by a legacy automaker dinosaur.  **Factor 2: Ford's leadership gets it** Meet Jim Farley. He's like Jim Hackett, but palatable to the shareholders. What does he care about? Yeah, autonomous tech and EVs. Would you prefer he be focusing Ford's attention elsewhere? Didn't think so. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/new-ford-ceo-jim-farley-announces-restructuring-and-executive-shakeup.html   **Bear Case: Ford's Fundamentals Alone Under-Price it: They Make Cars People Actually Want** Lord Elon told God-Conduit Cathie Wood on her podcast (it's on Youtube but I can't link it - search for Elon Cathie Wood Podcast and it's at 3:30) that EVs sales will comprise 1/3 of global auto sales by 2023-2025. That's crazy growth given that EVs were about 2% of US sales last year (I know, not fair to compare US to world but it's not the main point, just context).   If that growth rate holds we're looking at like 8-10 more years of ICE vehicle sales. Which ICE vehicles do Americans like? That's right, fucking TRUCKS and SUVs, the exact vehicles that are Ford's bread and butter. The F-150 is the best selling vehicle in America and has been for years.   This vehicle segment is super margin - the average sale price of an F150 is over $40k according to CarGurus (https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/Ford-F-150-d337). People pay stupid money for these things and Ford will be happy to accommodate them.  So, let's assume that my thesis above is incorrect, and Ford has no future in the EV space and will do nothing milk the dying ICE Truck-Yeah market until the day they hit insolvency. How could we value them then?    Fortunately, such a car maker actually exists and it's called fucking Fiat-Chrysler. They Yolo'd everything into the Murica-Fuck-Yeah market segment and will literally sell you a Hellcat powered anything - only car they make that doesn't have a V8 option is the fucking Pacifica - a minivan. These guys are lunatics and pre-Peurgot merger had absolutely no plan for adapting to the future of the auto market except for buying gas mileage credits from Tesla. Let's compare their stats to Ford from above: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCAU.VI/key-statistics?p=FCAU.VI   * Forward P/E: 5.78 * P/S:  0.24 * Mkt cap: $42B  So the market is literally pricing Ford right now quite similarly to Fiat-Chrylser. Ask yourself who's future strategy makes more sense. If Ford fucked up literally everything going forward, I think their valuation makes sense. But if they have just a few product successes in the new automotive landscape, they are going to stick around... and there's your catalyst.

Workhorse stock dropped 50% (im still hodling because I firmly believe in the company and think the stock will still raise in the next few months), and I can’t help but think the reason that Oshkosh won the contract is because ford has certain connections with certain people.

Roku, Deere &amp; Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news 🚀🚀**  Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.  7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy &amp; Financials hugely outperformed.  This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.  [Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications &amp; Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.  We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded. 🚀  So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it’s very likely we won’t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It’s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.🚀🚀  The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.  We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven’t seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.🚀🚀  This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings &amp; many others reporting this upcoming week.  In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more &amp; more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng &amp; many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick &amp; chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again &amp; Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.🚀🚀🚀  On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn’t help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.🚀🚀🚀  [Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top &amp; bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.🚀🚀  One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.🚀🚀🚀  But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

Lordstown Motors is an electric vehicle company that specializes in pickups. Their flagship vehicle, the Lordstown Endurance has received over 100,000 pre orders (~580 per order) and will roll out in September of 2021. If everyone of these pre ordered cars were sold for 50 thousand dollars (the base price) they would already have 5B in revenue. I think they can get more than 150,000 pre orders before release in september, as they have full prototypes ready.   What makes the Endurance so special? What is different about the Lordstown Endurance is that it has an electric motor in each of the 4 wheels. The brakes recharge some battery and the vehicle can go up to 300 miles in one charge  Lordstown Motors has the right people in charge to make sure it will grow exponentially.  CEO - Steve Burns - 35+ years of experience,  Co founder and former CEO of workhorse, quit his position to found Lordstown Motors.  President - Rick Schmidt - 30+ years of experience at Tesla, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai &amp; Volkswagen  Chief Production Officer - Shane Brown - 28+ years of experience at Hyundai, Kia, Honda &amp; Volkswagen Chief engineering officer - Darren Post - 30+ years of experience at GM, karma, &amp; Delphi  VP of propulsion - John Vo - 25+ years of experience at Tesla, Honeywell, and others.  CFO - Julio Rodriguez - 30+ years of experience at Workhorse &amp; others.  I don't remember when the last time was that I saw such an experienced leadership team. Lordstown is gonna go places.  Market: ~65B fleet pickup US Market   *The pickup truck market is the most profitable segment of the auto industry  *Highly underserved market with no other competitors targeting the EV pickup space  *Large order volumes with sticky contracts across industries  *Significant Lordstown Endurance interest from government   Cost of Ownership All electric vs Internal combustion (over 5 years)  Lordstown Endurance: Initial cost: $52,500  Price per unit: $0.13 per KWh  Fuel cost: $5,200  Maintenance cost: $1,800  Fed. Tax credit: ($7,500) Total: $52,000   Ford Raptor 4x4 (internal combustion)  Initial cost: $51,775  Price per unit: $2.57 per gallon  Fuel cost: $14,280  Maintenance cost: $5,125  Fed. Tax credit: N/A  Total: $71,180   Difference: $19,180   Over a 5 year period, you will save $19,180 by buying an All Electric pickup. This is a huge bonus to big companies as they order 500+ of these cars, they will save more than 25% on each vehicle. This will save companies millions of dollars. (95.9M if they order 500 of Lordstown Endurance pickups over a traditional internal combustion pickup)    Production capacity: The 6.2M sq. ft production facility can produce an estimated 600,000+ Endurance Pickups yearly. This can be improved as they have $320M in cash to finance further growth. If they reach my prediction of 150,000 pre orders, this facility can produce them in under 4 months (~50,000 units per month) (this is theoretical I do not expect them to complete the pre orders any time soon)     Lordstown Motors has HUGE growth potential because of this, I expect it to reach $100 dollars by the end of 2021   If I could only buy one stock for 2021, this might be it.

Introduction**  * The commodities boom of the 2000s saw prices [balloon to incredible heights](https://i.imgur.com/gLQfQzn.png). Over a ten-year period, the price of iron ore rose from [~$12/ton to nearly $190/ton](https://i.imgur.com/ZYTveMH.png) as surging demand across the world drove unprecedented need for raw materials. The fun was cut short in 2008 due to the Financial Crisis, however government intervention saw to a [swift rebound](https://i.imgur.com/wle4DdR.png) in industrial activity. *(Chart data from World Steel)*  * If you’ve been watching the markets recently, you would have noticed a major rally among all the industrial metals. [Copper](https://i.imgur.com/U2QsNSr.png). [Iron Ore](https://i.imgur.com/nSzdE4p.png). [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png). [Tin](https://i.imgur.com/lBr7RiM.png). This has been largely attributed to China’s quick recovery in 2020 as well as COVID related mining disruptions driving a mismatch between supply and demand. Heading into 2021, industrial metals have continued to rise as the rest of the world begins to come online after implementing policies designed to rejuvenate the economy. Other notable factors include: a strong US response leading to a weaker dollar and growing inflation concerns, a downturn in the services sector pushing consumers towards commodity intensive goods, and higher than ever global demand for large scale renewable infrastructure. All against a static, underinvested mining capacity owing to the [bearish environment](https://i.imgur.com/4dmwQmG.png) over the last ten years.   * I believe the current environment has primed metals and other commodities to see prolonged, elevated demand not seen since the previous commodity supercycle as a strong resurgence in manufacturing precedes a long-term, worldwide push towards renewable energy infrastructure.  **II. Coronavirus &amp; Government Intervention**  * The impact from the pandemic was far worse than the 2008 recession. A large-scale shutdown threw unemployment to the [stratosphere](https://i.imgur.com/3S0Gt56.png) and devastated the [markets](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). The conditions were so poor it forced [governments around the world](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19) to rapidly pass a series of heavy handed social and monetary policies – **note the US [absolutely jacked up the money supply](https://i.imgur.com/1vTd0GI.png) and [lowered rates to near zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/)** – to revitalize the economy and prevent further deterioration.   * The impact wasn’t just limited to consumers, businesses also felt the pressure as many manufacturers – expecting lower demand – [cut back on production and capacity]( https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-industrial-manufacturing.html#content-free-1-6e9a) as the commercial sector saw activity grind to a sharp stop. Miners, anticipating a period of economic weakness, not only sharply cut back production but also saw [severe disruptions](https://www.mining.com/worldwide-mining-disruptions/) across mining sites as COVID breakouts forced projects into suspension.   * Note that the sheer amount of financial support in 2020 far outstripped the [government response in 2008](https://i.imgur.com/TMs02Ot.png). The [$2T legislation in March](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-package-details-coronavirus/index.html) was followed with [$900B in December](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/politics/second-covid-stimulus-package-details/index.html) and President Biden has promised [another $1.9T proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) and [$2T infrastructure proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/02/11/biden-senators-infrastructure/).  **III. Industrial Demand**  * Due to their rigid response to the pandemic, China led the world recovery, with the rest of the world not far off, driving an early surge in commodity demand and sending metals prices soaring. With the services market almost entirely shut down, buyers had turned to more [commodity intensive goods](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-bounce-back-as-consumers-snap-up-goods-11604315271) and [overwhelmed the markets](https://theloadstar.com/its-a-juggling-act-say-handlers-as-cargo-congestion-swamps-europes-airports/). Unexpected consumer demand drained inventories and manufacturers found themselves with record setting backlogs. This shift was further supported by the government’s stimulus programs, actively adding spending power to the consumer class.  * For some time now, there has been growing focus around renewable energy infrastructure and green policies. Current trends have pushed back against [new investment into coal](https://i.imgur.com/xDiza5H.png) and [Oil &amp; Gas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/joe-biden-keystone-pipeline-climate-crisis) and [numerous](https://i.imgur.com/VweHRwA.png) [countries](https://i.imgur.com/vZRsX4o.png) [have](https://i.imgur.com/16DSmh2.png) announced environmental targets. Renewable investments have been highly profitable with [studies stating](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/05/28/just-how-good-an-investment-is-renewable-energy-new-study-reveals-all/?sh=7b9d17194d27) that renewables investments in Germany and France yielded returns of 178.2% over a five year period, compared with -20.7% for fossil fuel investments.

[Economists now see US-China GDP parity in 2028 from 2033](https://i.imgur.com/OOkc7mO.png).

[Higher iron ore imports](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/iron-ore-imports-outside-china-show-signs-of-recovery-russell).  * Furthermore, EVs will require significant resources for new factories, batteries, and cars. This demand is already noticeable on [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png) and analysts have increasingly raised their [projections](https://www.mining.com/nickel-demand-for-evs-expected-to-shoot-up-in-the-next-20-years/) on the metal. Ford even admits [here](https://www.mining.com/web/ford-joins-global-initiative-to-promote-responsible-mining/) they will be more reliant on mined material going forward. [These guys will probably need more metals too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market).  * Global construction is looking at a [record growth](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2021/02/global-market-scan-2021-a-year-of-recovery-and-reacceleration-in-global-construction) for the year. Additionally, expanding the sector is a way for governments to have an immediate effect on [employment](https://i.imgur.com/JnbiYUS.png) and thus the economy. [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/infrastructure-stimulus-in-covid-pandemic-recovery-and-beyond)  * Lastly, the most recent [ISM](https://www.ismworld.org/globalassets/pub/research-and-surveys/rob/pmi/rob202102pmi.pdf) manufacturing index has continued to point towards growth with low inventory, high backlog, and overall bullish outlook on economic activity.  [Btw](https://i.imgur.com/6oK8as7.png)   **IV. Financial Demand**  * The government’s expansionary monetary policies were successful in staving off further deterioration, however this resulted in extremely low interest rates across the world as well as a sharp increase in the money supply. [The DXY has weakened](https://i.imgur.com/JC9Yylb.png) starting in March 2020 and [current consensus](https://currency.com/usd-forecast-2021#:~:text=US%20dollar%20news%3A%20more%20pain%20ahead&amp;text=Setting%20out%20its%20USD%20forecast,against%20most%20major%20fiat%20currencies.) is that it will further devalue as the Biden administration implements the $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure proposals. The massive printing [heightened inflation concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/inflation-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-the-fed-could-be-in-a-bind) and the demand for hedges such as metals. Furthermore, a [low dollar](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294) raises the buying power of foreign currency and [low rates](https://www.thebalance.com/commodity-prices-when-interest-rates-rise-4084273) ease capital for companies; both are economically linked to higher commodity prices.  * Alongside the economic machinations at play, major financial institutions such as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM) and [JPMorgan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fifth-commodity-supercycle-has-started-says-highly-regarded-jpmorgan-strategist-11613044794) have announced they see the beginnings of a commodity supercycle with some forecasts seeing iron ore as high as [$165/t for three years]( https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-jumps-as-vale-reports-low-output/) as others upgrade their projections on [steel](https://i.imgur.com/FuUtHLj.png). Not all metal demand is strictly industrial and trader demand for these metals for speculation and inflation hedging purposes are likely to further increase.  * PS. [This was JPMorgan just a little while ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/jpmorgan-defends-its-call-on-metal-trades-after-investor-backlash.html)   **V. Commodities, Metals, and Mines**   * The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged, stronger economic activity. Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments, weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns, as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies. With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions, consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory, high backlogs, and rising raw material costs. Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges.   * All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers. Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government’s upcoming spending agenda. The markets – on near zero interest rates – are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional $1.9T and $2.0T planned with potentially more support even after that. **Miners, aware of the impending inflection point, have already pledged to intensify cash distribution to shareholders.** $MT announced [$650M +$570M buyback](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/media/press-releases/arcelormittal-announces-share-buyback-program-3) and issued $0.30 dividends. $FCX announced a [performance based buyback policy alongside a cash dividend of $0.30/share](https://investors.fcx.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/Freeport-McMoRan-Announces-Reinstatement-of-Common-Stock-Dividend-and-Adoption-of-Performance-Based-Payout-Policy/default.aspx).  * Mines have traditionally been heavily slow businesses with lead times for construction to full production as long as [8 years](https://www.extractiveshub.org/topic/view/id/21/chapterId/268). While the jump from 2008-2010 came off a strong bull cycle with many mines already well into capacity expansion and new projects, 2020 has come off one of mining’s worst downcycles with weak capacity investments as miners opted to scale down from preexisting operations. In fact, 2020 saw production of [iron ore](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-iron-ore.pdf), [copper](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf), and [nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-nickel.pdf) all flat to lower versus last year. Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output, however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector. Given high enough demand, a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility.  **VI. Conclusion**  * The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy. The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly $4T in stimulus and infrastructure. Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets. Additionally, the US-China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure.  * Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity. These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs. The most recent $900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind, we have yet to see the impact of Biden’s $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure policy, and concerns around inflation have never been higher. All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand. Inflation, market demand, and short supply all combined; I see considerable upside for commodities, metals, and miners well into the future.  * $FCX 1/21c @32, $MT 1/21c @25, $VALE 1/21c @20  **Tl;dr:** [Fed print; metals go brrr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)  **P.S.** [Mining Stocks](https://i.imgur.com/bsXSJvP.png)  **P.P.S.** [Metals Prices](https://i.imgur.com/qP8aCJ3.jpg)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9081438|public|confidence|self|Miners and the Global Commodity Supercycle ft.

It is long but I hope you will enjoy it.     Read this all or you will die. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the    company Forum Merger 3 who is  merging with Electric Last Mile    Solutions, an EV company    specializing  in last mile delivery and work    vans. ELMS will be the first    and only  Class 1 electric vehicle on    the market, coming as early as   Q3,  with  no other Class 1 EV as    competition. They are also bringing a   Class  2  EV truck to market    next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to   be   first to market in    Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over  the   old  Hummer plant    in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of    working  with an    already successful EV company, allowing for instant     transposition  of   truck plans ready for production.  ELMS     has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has       received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current   stock     price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock   other than     some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical   behavior for   most   EV companies. So what  gives?  After      doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back   most investors back from committing to this great company is their        connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a        company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not        unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the        market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new  companies,       we want maximum transparency, which seems almost  impossible any   time     we're dealing with a Chinese company. However,  as my research   has   shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is  nothing to be   concerned   about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite –  something that   will help   propel them   forward and accelerate their  process through   previously   successfully   developed truck plans and  numerous industry   connections.  # I.  The Team  First,       let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to     know,  a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team  behind     ELMS  is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry  with   years  of   experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into  each of   the  team   members, some  interesting connections emerged  amongst  them  and  amongst   different   auto/EV companies(including a   connection to  Tesla)  . These   connections  made some of the pieces   start to fall  into  place. In   particular, I  wanted to figure out   more so their  connection  to the   Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and   something to  be concerned  about?   After digging deeper  my  questions  were answered.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Allstars](https://preview.redd.it/2bs3me57pph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3d824dc0ec289199bfbf443b6a2f4f70f39199b)  ***The Allstars*** ***-***  **James (Jim) Taylor** – 35+ years experience – CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**        he pivoted the company’s focus from the electrification of cars   and      SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors,   now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working   with).      Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.        Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of     Cadillac,    which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is     the    powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a     company and    what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs.  He    probably has    some of the most experience of anyone in the  industry    when it comes  to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with  Henrik  Fisker  of FSR) and    Workhorse which we all know. His  innovation and    experience on developing    different types of EVs,  will allow for    future design and build    improvements. Jim, also  Canadian, is known as    “The Great One” when it    comes to the EV  world. He is also known as    Jim “The EV Man” Taylor,    because like  the show Home Improvement,  he   is always building and    innovating in  the garage.  **Jason Luo** – 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.         Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems   (now      Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety     companies    in the world.  Oversaw the company’s acquisition of  Takata    Corporation    for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the  board  of   directors of    Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions,  ATCDrivetrain and    Sybridge  Technologies.    He has extensive  experience in the automotive    world and  more   importantly with large  companies. In addition he  has   been  through a few   different  mergers and acquisitions which is  an   added  benefit. He knows   what  it takes to come out on top.  **Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,        Inc .  She previously led Google’s automotive services program,      during   which time she released Google products, including Google   Maps,    into   automakers’ new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has   served on    the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd   largest  auto   dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is  that  she is  the   co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**        (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation       industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I       found on  their group website was called “High-Potential Regions for       Electric  Truck Deployments”. It talked about geographical areas  they      want to  focus on and develop – one of them being the Great  Lakes.   Guess    where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the  Great   Lakes.     This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events ,  so she   can use    this board as a  means to spread the word  throughout the   industry.    Interestingly enough,  this group just  started running an   EV truck demo    for data collection  and  analytics, and two of the   companies already    involved are  Lightning  E-motors and  Workhorse.  **Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,         during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard  also       helped expand the company’s international  footprint in many    European     and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS    get some     international connections. Hes overseen numerous    acquisitions, as well     as being a leading member of the team that    managed UPS’s IPO in 1999,   at   the time the largest in U.S. history.    He is no stranger to     understanding what it takes to make a new    operation a successful one.  **Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.        Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving       company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign       from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an       employee. You could  say she really turned his software into  hardware!      Brian currently serves  on the boards of aemsAG and  Footprint US      (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the  Boards of Deere      &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry  Association, as well as      serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone   Advisory Committee. He is the go      to guy for the chips and computers  for  the vehicles. This will  help     with any autonomous driving they  have  planned, as well as  their on     board ELMS-AIR system (more on  this later).  **Neil Goldberg**,       - 45+ yrs – Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;       Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing,      merchandising  and general management experience.  **David Boris –**       30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has  been      involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board  member,      underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed  Chef,  Inc.,     which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II  Corporation  in  October    2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,   despite it being  one  company   that I  was not fond of due to my  nutrition  background. I   think the   food itself  is over priced crap  but it has held  steady  in  price ever   since merger  completion. This  bodes well for  ELMS.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Players](https://preview.redd.it/q8j7p4l8pph61.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17458efffdd343f8a5ad386b9c4411e49ef3022b)  ***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***  ***Jerry Hu***       – 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership  and     Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and  other     management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**  ***Justin Prann*** – 15+ years – CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.  ***Kev Adjemian*** **–** 20+ years – CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**  ***Albert Li*** – 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.  ***Benjamin Wu***       – 15+ years – GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head    for    Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and  international      corporate transactions for both  private and public  companies.  So      as we can, see  this team is ridiculously good and has excellent       connections that  run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and  other      places  around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies  that  are      connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS,  tell  me    that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings.  This team     covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top  contender   in   the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience,  have held   top   level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the  knowledge   and   know-how in  many  different aspects of electric  vehicles and the     industry overall.  # II. What Does ELMS Do?  Now       that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they      do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial       delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV      companies  include:  ▪First and      Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely  HUGE     for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity  of     being alone  in the field.  ▪Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production  ▪Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later  ▪Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1  ▪Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China  Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note – this is from December so it may have changed some since.  &amp;#x200B;  [Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/rkcwj2napph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d0d49117764f39296c81d7c2c7a53928565fc5)  The       ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline       counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo    space   ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by     35% (50%    compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around     $1550 for   ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1.  It    becomes   even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume  per    cubic ft   that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have  218ft.   It  appears   that they  have plans to make different  variations of   their  Class 1  and  Class 3,  being able to turn them  into Class 2s as   well  based off   individual  needs. They will have a  range of 150 to   200 miles  and be   capable of a  full recharge in as  little as two   hours. These  types of   vans are used in  many  capacities of our   society. For example,  delivery   and ecommerce   (Amazon, Fedex, DHL),   communications (Verizon,    Comcast), small   businesses (local flower   shop, food trucks), and    utility and local   municipality vehicles.   There is no lack of demand for    these types  of  vehicles.  A    cool  feature  that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS   that  I   think has  been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the    vans    themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to  a      specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that    business.    This includes  things like installing custom drawers and    cabinets,    shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical    upfitting process    involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous    different ones, and    takes on avg 130-140  days from order to    delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :  ▪ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery  ▪ One warranty single point of contact for customer  ▪    Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently      in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and     Auto   Truck Group.  I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.  &amp;#x200B;  [Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/m4grfq9bpph61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f85a1b04e12db2c92c25425567d2052f4dae97)  Next,     the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS -AIR,     an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find   much      information about any specifics except for some clues in their      investor   presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data  systems     in   partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide  many     benefits  to  their customers. Some areas that will be  serviced include :  ▪Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles  ▪Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance  ▪Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports  ▪Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins  Some       of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla     for   example, are the ability for the software updates to happen       frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in       communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be       collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be.     The   experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from  Intel    will    be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing  with a    system   like this is more  and more areas of value for the  companies    buying it.   For example, there  will be savings from being  able to    easily collect   accurate tax data and  driving logs from  the drivers.    Time will also be   saved with something  such as the  automated  updates   and knowing exactly   when a van will need  to be  serviced or   inspected.  As time goes on and   more data becomes   collected, the   ELMS-AIR  service will only prove to  be  more valuable  for  both the   company and  their customers.  # III. Sales and Financials  The       ELMS team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in   connection     with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion  enterprise  value at     closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have  $379 million of  cash to     fund  operations and growth. They have said  that no additional   capital     requirements are needed after close to  achieve positive cash   flow.     With  their $379 million cash minus  $150mill in debt, that  gives  us    $229  million in net cash to work  with. There are a total  of     142,500,000  shares. Current market cap  at the share price of  $12, gives     us $1.71  billion.  ELMS      currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,   representing  a    revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to   60,000  orders by    the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they  are in   talks with or    have preorders from already,  include: Penske,  Cox +   Siemens (cant  make   that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS,  and others.   These  contracts   will work directly with  companies such  as Ikea,  Best  Buy,  Walmart,   Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience  and  connections of   the team will   no doubt lead to more  contracts  in the  future.  The  ELMS   business plan  includes a conservative volume ramp, with      approximately  4,000  vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth      quarter of 2021,   accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in      2022, and   approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. “Our team      collectively has   decades of experience launching vehicles for global      OEMs, and so  while  the facility has an annual production capacity  of     100,000  units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial   volumes    so  that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new   brand,     establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.”  I    have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000       preorders  being “contingent upon satisfaction of customer       requirements.” As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more       than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off  its      Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will  give   the    customers  everything they want and then some. If  anything, I   would    expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than  their Sokon   counterpart.  &amp;#x200B;  [Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.](https://preview.redd.it/6niamm8cpph61.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31829ca0dab1801b3b92033ced5fb13596095a9e)  **\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*  *THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.        Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was  the       mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very  mixed       results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an  emphasis  on      creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area.  Guess where  the  new     ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right  next to  South Bend  in    the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be  possible  that ELMS  will    have  first priority now for any new  government  contracts  relating to  EV   delivery or services, or maybe  additional   funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's  plan to   electrify the US, and now Mayor    Pete has a perfect  opportunity to   give back to his hometown and bring     more jobs and  prosperity to   South Bend and the surrounding areas.  And  as a matter  of fact, Pete   Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally  at  the  ELMS(Hummer) factory   last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his     radar.  *THEORY #2*:       This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor  presentation     when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks  will be used  for     municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing  of it and  said hey     just some random counties they have worked   with. The  Michigan and     Indiana seals make sense since that's where  they  are  located. And the     California ones also since that's where  most of   the former  employees   and  Seres motors was headquartered.  But then I   noticed the  top left   seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This  just so  happens  to be  right next to   my  hometown so I am very  familiar with  this area.  Why  does the   Fairfax, VA  seal appear  alongside those of  Michigan,   Indiana, and   California?  A  side note  about Fairfax  County – it is  very  wealthy and   very liberal.  Turns  out they have  quite a few Green   Initiatives in   action. Last year   they stated that  “One-hundred  percent  of eligible   county vehicles   scheduled for  purchase in fiscal  year 2021  shall be   replaced with   electric  vehicles and the  infrastructure needed  can be   supported in   fiscal  year 2021.”  Just a  few weeks ago another  article   stated  “Fairfax   County Public Schools  is getting its first  electric    school bus today  as  part of a  statewide initiative led by  Dominion    Energy.”  Interesting! It  seems  quite obvious Fairfax County is   gearing   up  for wide scale EV   adoption, and wants to do implement it  as  soon   as  possible. Maryland  and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for  highest rate  of  EV   adoption, while  Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be  damn sure they    will  be looking to  improve on that  number.  &amp;#x200B;  [Peculiar     section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County,   VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they  are    working on?](https://preview.redd.it/o34xxz0dpph61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c87eb08d3ef475c853527e9fb240fd67547a4c8)  Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**        received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December,  the       Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads  the    state’s    economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series  of    conditional   tax  credits and training grants based on its plans  to    create new jobs   in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**        in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment     (HBI)    tax credit program based on the company’s planned capital     investment  in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it     is an  excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.  Another     huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical       startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the      N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already       successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments       already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This  gives      them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we   compare     ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors,  “Rivian’s  becoming     the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion,  $3  billion,” Taylor   said.   “If you  think $200 million to $300  million  for product   engineering,   ours is $80  million, That’s  really just  airbags, seat   belts and   adapting to \[U.S.  safety  requirements\].  Tooling is already   in place   because SERES spent  $20  million for the  canceled SUV plans.   Earlier   post-Hummer occupants   also left some  usable equipment  behind.  “Coming   off the existing   platform is worth  hundreds of  millions,”  Taylor said.   “Supplier  tooling  alone would  normally be a  couple  hundred million.”   Well,  that's a  bargain.  The institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:  ▪Alpine    Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around        $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of ELMS. One of the biggest purchases so        far.  ▪BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ▪Phoenix Holdings Ltd – 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)  ▪Bank of America – 70k shares (\~$1mill)  ▪Toronto Dominion Bank – 15k shares (\~$203k)  ▪STA Wealth Management – 13k shares (\~$176k)  ▪UBS Group – Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)  We also have in the past month:  ▪Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.  ▪P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.  ▪Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.  ▪Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.  I     have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find       for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would  imagine      this  will get larger once there is an official merger  date.  As    investors, we would  like to see alternative revenue streams to  help     the  company grow.  ELMS has plans for a few different ways to   increase    their   business. One of the main ways is that they will  produce   their   vans  for  the entire North American market (CA and  Mexico),   Europe,  and   China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS  is   estimating a    potential upside  of $300 million. The other major  way  ELMS  will    increase revenue is  through the monitization of their   ELMS-AIR  data.    They will gather and  mine all the data and services   from their     vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable   information that other     companies will want to buy. They  will also   use this data to  optimize    and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This   data has an  estimated upside  of   around $50-100 million in increased    revenue.  As volume and sales  also   increase, they will introduce    passenger  van models, as well as  rental   or subscription based   services.  Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :  ▪No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches  ▪Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022  ▪Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market  ▪Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025  # IV. The Indiana Factory  &amp;#x200B;  [Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/a37ay5nepph61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c852006122b925ef4433e9f5cc61dc8b6630f7)  Another **MASSIVE**     way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the      production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they      will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was   originally    used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got   taken over   by  James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This   plant has the    capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually,   something that ELMS    will most likely need to  do by  next year. The   Indiana Office of    Economic Development Executive   Director Bill   Schalliol says “ELMS has    worked out a deal with the United     Autoworkers Union, which has    represented workers at this plant in     recent years. ELMS will initially    launch with 140 workers, increasing     staffing to 450 workers when it    reaches full production on one   line of   smaller vans. Within four    years, the company could have 960   employees if   it produces a second    assembly line, manufacturing   larger sized  delivery  vans.” The    Mishawaka plant was selected   because it has been  retrofitted  already    for electric vehicle   production, and has a strong  supply chain  and    experienced workforce   available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.  Another    bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production –      workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The      land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a     future  site  for in house manufacturing of parts.  In    addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters     with    31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200   employees    has   been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters     strategically    positions ELMS in the center of a network of   suppliers   and partners  and   provides access to one of the world’s   best   automotive talent pools.   The  state-of-the-art facility   includes an   over 15,000 square feet   prototype  lab, where ELMS plans   to assemble   initial battery pack and   electric  motor prototypes as   well as   complete pre-production vehicle   builds. ELMS  also plans  to  utilize   the facility as a customer center   where it can  work  with  customers to   understand their vehicle   specifications and   analytics  needs, as  well  as conduct test drives.     “In addition to    facilitating our  growth,  the design of our new global   headquarters   will  allow for   collaboration across all aspects of our    engineering –  from  vehicle   design, prototyping and software  development   – and  customer    engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver  for its customers   the  most    efficient and customized solutions for  their last mile use    cases,”   said  James Taylor.  ELMS    plans to   open  additional offices in California and other   locations  in    proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs“  ELMS  plans  to build    around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more  than double   output to   9,100  vehicles in  2022 when the second  vehicle is added,  and  grow to   83,000  for both by  2025. The vehicle  and plant are said  to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.”  Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.  # V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection  Ok,    sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company      that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Sokon deez nuts.   Yes,     officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as    DFSK.   They   have been around since 2003, and are well established in   the    Chinese   auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers,   actually.    Sokon  has  a proven product and demand.  They have over   200,000 gas    models,  plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to   over 1  million   miles  driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top   of that,  they  were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**       in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a   large     customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some   legitimate     companies that even me  and you can recognize. This   includes ecommerce     delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service   for the China Post,     utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles  for  the Hong Kong     International Airport.  **Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**  This    takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our       very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was     created   in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An      interesting   side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the      cofounder and   former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin      worked before   this? A little company called Atieva, now known as     Lucid  Motors!  One  thing I   want    to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen   mentioned     regarding “bad reviews” from employees online about  Seres    (Glassdoor I    believe). This has been cited as a reason for   concern  and    uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind  ELMS  will     function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have  here will   be    the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a  formidable   team    and workforce  together. Jim only started working  around May,  and    Seres  had already  been bleeding cash and laying  off workers.  The     combination of increasing  tensions with China and  the hardships  of     trying into expand in multiple  countries at  once, caused the  eventual     dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have  wondered also if  most of  these    reviews were due to turmoil going   on between specific  people  in the    company, such as Martin Eberhard  and  other CEOs. He  did get  into it    with meme lord Elon and that  ended up  leading to  his ousting  at Tesla.    At Seres, he also ended  up leaving them  in  less than a  year and he   took  people along with  him to another EV   startup.  Doesn't sound like   much  of a team  player.  Seres   ended up ceasing  their US operations, but has continued to  survive      overseas and has  successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be      producing a  Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad  to    be   honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.  **Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**  Well,    they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the       existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time   and      R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is       already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess  work      needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field  experience and      warranty data  from the millions of miles already  driven in these  cars.     This will give  ELMS a huge head start to  develop and improve  many     aspects of their  automated systems and  ELMS-AIR. The high  volume of     existing supplier  based contracts  will be used to their  advantage as     well. There will be  absolutely  no lack of connections  or reach that     this allstar team won't  be  able to tap into. And then  of course, the     amount of money saved  from  the Mishawaka plant and  already invested   Sokon development, is  well over  half a billion  dollars. Nice.  # VI. Is This A Chinese Company?  The     last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the       important question of: “Is this a Chinese company or not?”  **The short and easy answer is NO.**  **ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**  **They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**  Sokon       will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla       supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic   supply   for the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard   design    for   the batteries will be sourced in the U.S.  Unfortunately,  ELMS    cannot  go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to  transition as much  as    possible  in  the future. Right now, they are  also focused on making     sure they  can get  an attractive and  affordable price point to its     customers.  “Hey, made  in America.  Made in Mishawaka. Half of it’s     American,” he  said. “Our  engineers  are here. The software guys. The     homologation is  all based in   Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to    source  the majority  of our EV   systems and componentry here in the    U.S.    “You’ll be going  into  the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys.    I’d say  there’s a low   chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,” Taylor    said. “But  after we’re   finished, it should  be looked at as just a  few   parts from  China.  If we  move all the way  into vertical  integration,   we’re like   everybody  else. I’m not sure we  can hang  onto that price   point.”   So as  we can  see, there is some  strategy  here at play in   order to  secure  some of  these early and first  mover  advantage   contracts.  # VII. Technical Analysis  Had       to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much       nothing  overly bearish or bullish. ELMS broke below resistance the   past   2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise   above     it and  turn it from resistance back into support.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qs601a6hpph61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25524d8b088c71fa32bd9a269bf3614a12ecc555  # VIII. Conclusion  If       you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to   China     and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become   much     more  confident and aware of the future potential of this  amazing   new    company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came  into this    looking   to  alleviate some of my worries about the  stagnant and    seemingly  void  or  negative energy surrounding this  company. I came   out  the  other end  a  changed man. They say money  doesn't grow on   trees, but   they missed  one.  The ELMS tree. And it  has acorns for all   of us.  Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img auhv7g3ipph61...*  Disclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons  Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice.

It is long but I hope you will enjoy it.    Read this all or you will die. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the   company Forum Merger 3 who is  merging with Electric Last Mile   Solutions, an EV company    specializing  in last mile delivery and work   vans. ELMS will be the first    and only  Class 1 electric vehicle on   the market, coming as early as   Q3,  with  no other Class 1 EV as   competition. They are also bringing a   Class  2  EV truck to market   next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to   be   first to market in   Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over  the   old  Hummer plant   in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of    working  with an   already successful EV company, allowing for instant     transposition of   truck plans ready for production.  ELMS    has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has      received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current  stock     price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock  other than     some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical  behavior for   most   EV companies. So what  gives?  After     doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back     most investors back from committing to this great company is their       connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a       company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not       unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the       market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,       we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any   time     we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research   has   shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be   concerned   about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite – something that   will help   propel them   forward and accelerate their process through   previously   successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry   connections.  I.  The Team  First,      let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to    know,  a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind     ELMS  is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with   years  of   experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of   the  team   members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst  them  and  amongst   different   auto/EV companies(including a  connection to  Tesla)  . These   connections  made some of the pieces  start to fall  into  place. In   particular, I  wanted to figure out  more so their  connection  to the   Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and  something to  be concerned  about?   After digging deeper  my questions  were answered.  📷  The Allstars  ***The Allstars*** ***-***  **James (Jim) Taylor** – 35+ years experience – CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**       he pivoted the company’s focus from the electrification of cars  and      SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors,  now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working  with).      Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.       Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of    Cadillac,    which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is    the    powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a    company and    what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He    probably has    some of the most experience of anyone in the industry    when it comes  to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik  Fisker  of FSR) and    Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and    experience on developing    different types of EVs, will allow for    future design and build    improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as    “The Great One” when it    comes to the EV world. He is also known as    Jim “The EV Man” Taylor,    because like the show Home Improvement,  he   is always building and    innovating in the garage.  **Jason Luo** – 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.        Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems  (now      Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety    companies    in the world.  Oversaw the company’s acquisition of Takata    Corporation    for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board  of   directors of    Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATCDrivetrain and    Sybridge  Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive    world and  more   importantly with large companies. In addition he  has   been  through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is  an   added  benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.  **Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,       Inc .  She previously led Google’s automotive services program,     during   which time she released Google products, including Google  Maps,    into   automakers’ new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has  served on    the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd  largest  auto   dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that  she is  the   co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**       (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation      industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I      found on  their group website was called “High-Potential Regions for      Electric  Truck Deployments”. It talked about geographical areas they      want to  focus on and develop – one of them being the Great Lakes.   Guess    where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great   Lakes.     This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she   can use    this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the   industry.    Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an   EV truck demo    for data collection  and analytics, and two of the   companies already    involved are  Lightning E-motors and  Workhorse.  **Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,        during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also       helped expand the company’s international  footprint in many   European     and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS   get some     international connections. Hes overseen numerous   acquisitions, as well     as being a leading member of the team that   managed UPS’s IPO in 1999,   at   the time the largest in U.S. history.   He is no stranger to     understanding what it takes to make a new   operation a successful one.  **Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.       Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving      company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign      from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an      employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!      Brian currently serves  on the boards of amsAG and Footprint US      (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere      &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as      serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go      to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will  help     with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as  their on     board ELMS-AIR system (more on this later).  **Neil Goldberg**,      - 45+ yrs – Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;      Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing,     merchandising  and general management experience.  **David Boris –**      30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been      involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,      underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef,  Inc.,     which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation  in  October    2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being  one  company   that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I   think the   food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady  in  price ever   since merger  completion. This bodes well for  ELMS.  The Players  ***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***  ***Jerry Hu***      – 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and     Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other     management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**  ***Justin Prann*** – 15+ years – CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.  ***Kev Adjemian*** **–** 20+ years – CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**  ***Albert Li*** – 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.  ***Benjamin Wu***      – 15+ years – GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head   for    Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international      corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.  So      as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent       connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and  other      places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies  that  are     connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS,  tell  me   that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings.  This team    covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top  contender  in   the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience,  have held  top   level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the  knowledge  and   know-how in  many  different aspects of electric  vehicles and the    industry overall.  II. What Does ELMS Do?  Now      that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they     do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial      delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV     companies  include:  ▪First and     Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE     for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of     being alone  in the field.  ▪Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production  ▪Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later  ▪Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1  ▪Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China  Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note – this is from December so it may have changed some since.  Only Class 1 - no other competition  The      ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline      counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo   space   ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by    35% (50%    compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around    $1550 for   ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It    becomes   even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per    cubic ft   that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft.   It  appears   that they  have plans to make different variations of   their  Class 1  and  Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as   well  based off   individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to   200 miles  and be   capable of a  full recharge in as little as two   hours. These  types of   vans are used in  many capacities of our   society. For example,  delivery   and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL),   communications (Verizon,    Comcast), small  businesses (local flower   shop, food trucks), and    utility and local  municipality vehicles.   There is no lack of demand for    these types of  vehicles.  A    cool  feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS   that  I   think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the    vans   themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to  a     specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that   business.    This includes  things like installing custom drawers and   cabinets,    shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical   upfitting process    involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous   different ones, and    takes on avg 130-140  days from order to   delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :  ▪ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery  ▪ One warranty single point of contact for customer  ▪   Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently     in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and    Auto   Truck Group.  I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.  📷  Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.  Next,    the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS -AIR,    an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much      information about any specifics except for some clues in their     investor   presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems     in   partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many     benefits  to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :  ▪Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles  ▪Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance  ▪Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports  ▪Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins  Some      of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla    for   example, are the ability for the software updates to happen      frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in      communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be      collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be.    The   experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel    will    be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a    system   like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies    buying it.   For example, there  will be savings from being able to    easily collect   accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers.    Time will also be   saved with something  such as the automated  updates   and knowing exactly   when a van will need  to be serviced or   inspected.  As time goes on and   more data becomes  collected, the   ELMS-AIR  service will only prove to  be  more valuable for  both the   company and  their customers.  III. Sales and Financials  The      ELMS team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection     with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at     closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to     fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional   capital     requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash   flow.     With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that  gives  us    $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total  of     142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of  $12, gives     us $1.71  billion.  ELMS     currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing  a    revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000  orders by    the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in   talks with or    have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +   Siemens (cant  make   that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.   These  contracts   will work directly with  companies such as Ikea,  Best  Buy,  Walmart,   Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and  connections of   the team will   no doubt lead to more  contracts in the  future.  The  ELMS  business plan  includes a conservative volume ramp, with     approximately  4,000  vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth     quarter of 2021,   accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in     2022, and   approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. “Our team     collectively has   decades of experience launching vehicles for global     OEMs, and so  while  the facility has an annual production capacity of     100,000  units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial  volumes    so  that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new  brand,     establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.”  I   have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000      preorders  being “contingent upon satisfaction of customer      requirements.” As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more      than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its      Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give   the    customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I   would    expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon   counterpart.  📷  Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.  **\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*  *THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.       Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the       mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed       results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis  on      creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where  the  new     ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to  South Bend  in    the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible  that ELMS  will    have  first priority now for any new government  contracts  relating to  EV   delivery or services, or maybe additional   funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to   electrify the US, and now Mayor    Pete has a perfect opportunity to   give back to his hometown and bring     more jobs and prosperity to   South Bend and the surrounding areas.  And  as a matter of fact, Pete   Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally  at  the ELMS(Hummer) factory   last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his    radar.  *THEORY #2*:      This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation     when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used  for     municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and  said hey     just some random counties they have worked  with. The  Michigan and     Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are  located. And the     California ones also since that's where most of   the former  employees   and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I   noticed the  top left   seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so  happens  to be  right next to   my  hometown so I am very familiar with  this area.  Why  does the   Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of  Michigan,   Indiana, and   California?  A  side note about Fairfax  County – it is  very  wealthy and   very liberal.  Turns out they have  quite a few Green   Initiatives in   action. Last year  they stated that  “One-hundred  percent  of eligible   county vehicles  scheduled for  purchase in fiscal  year 2021  shall be   replaced with  electric  vehicles and the  infrastructure needed  can be   supported in  fiscal  year 2021.”  Just a  few weeks ago another  article   stated “Fairfax   County Public Schools  is getting its first  electric   school bus today  as  part of a  statewide initiative led by  Dominion   Energy.”  Interesting! It  seems  quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing   up  for wide scale EV   adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon   as  possible. Maryland  and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of  EV   adoption, while  Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they    will  be looking to  improve on that  number.  Peculiar    section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County,  VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are    working on?  Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**       received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the       Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the    state’s    economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of    conditional   tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to    create new jobs   in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**       in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment    (HBI)    tax credit program based on the company’s planned capital    investment  in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it    is an  excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.  Another    huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical      startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the     N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already      successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments      already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives      them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we  compare     ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, “Rivian’s  becoming     the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3  billion,” Taylor   said.   “If you  think $200 million to $300 million  for product   engineering,   ours is $80  million, That’s really just  airbags, seat   belts and   adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\].  Tooling is already   in place   because SERES spent  $20 million for the  canceled SUV plans.   Earlier   post-Hummer occupants  also left some  usable equipment  behind.  “Coming   off the existing  platform is worth  hundreds of  millions,”  Taylor said.   “Supplier tooling  alone would  normally be a  couple  hundred million.”   Well, that's a  bargain.  The institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:  ▪Alpine   Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around       $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of ELMS. One of the biggest purchases so       far.  ▪BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ▪Phoenix Holdings Ltd – 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)  ▪Bank of America – 70k shares (\~$1mill)  ▪Toronto Dominion Bank – 15k shares (\~$203k)  ▪STA Wealth Management – 13k shares (\~$176k)  ▪UBS Group – Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)  We also have in the past month:  ▪Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.  ▪P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.  ▪Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.  ▪Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.  I    have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find      for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine      this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.  As    investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help     the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to   increase    their  business. One of the main ways is that they will  produce   their   vans for  the entire North American market (CA and  Mexico),   Europe,  and  China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS  is   estimating a   potential upside  of $300 million. The other major  way  ELMS  will   increase revenue is  through the monitization of their   ELMS-AIR  data.   They will gather and  mine all the data and services   from their    vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable   information that other    companies will want to buy. They  will also   use this data to optimize    and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This   data has an estimated upside  of   around $50-100 million in increased    revenue. As volume and sales  also   increase, they will introduce    passenger van models, as well as  rental   or subscription based   services.  Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :  ▪No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches  ▪Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022  ▪Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market  ▪Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025  IV. The Indiana Factory  Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.  Another **MASSIVE**    way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the     production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they     will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was  originally    used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got  taken over   by  James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This  plant has the    capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually,  something that ELMS    will most likely need to  do by  next year. The  Indiana Office of    Economic Development Executive   Director Bill  Schalliol says “ELMS has    worked out a deal with the United    Autoworkers Union, which has    represented workers at this plant in    recent years. ELMS will initially    launch with 140 workers, increasing    staffing to 450 workers when it    reaches full production on one  line of   smaller vans. Within four    years, the company could have 960  employees if   it produces a second    assembly line, manufacturing  larger sized  delivery  vans.” The    Mishawaka plant was selected  because it has been  retrofitted  already    for electric vehicle  production, and has a strong  supply chain  and    experienced workforce  available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.  Another   bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production –     workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The     land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a    future  site  for in house manufacturing of parts.  In   addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters    with    31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200  employees    has   been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters    strategically    positions ELMS in the center of a network of  suppliers   and partners  and   provides access to one of the world’s  best   automotive talent pools.   The  state-of-the-art facility  includes an   over 15,000 square feet   prototype  lab, where ELMS plans  to assemble   initial battery pack and   electric  motor prototypes as  well as   complete pre-production vehicle   builds. ELMS  also plans to  utilize   the facility as a customer center   where it can  work with  customers to   understand their vehicle   specifications and  analytics  needs, as  well  as conduct test drives.     “In addition to   facilitating our  growth,  the design of our new global   headquarters  will  allow for   collaboration across all aspects of our   engineering –  from  vehicle   design, prototyping and software development   – and  customer    engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers   the  most    efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use    cases,”   said  James Taylor.  ELMS   plans to   open  additional offices in California and other  locations  in    proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs“ ELMS  plans  to build    around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double   output to   9,100  vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added,  and  grow to   83,000  for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said  to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.”  Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.  V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection  Ok,   sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company     that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Sokon deez nuts.  Yes,     officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as   DFSK.   They   have been around since 2003, and are well established in  the    Chinese   auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers,  actually.    Sokon  has  a proven product and demand.  They have over  200,000 gas    models,  plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to  over 1  million   miles  driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top  of that,  they  were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**      in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a  large     customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some  legitimate     companies that even me  and you can recognize. This  includes ecommerce     delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service  for the China Post,     utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for  the Hong Kong     International Airport.  **Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**  This   takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our      very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was    created   in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An     interesting   side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the     cofounder and   former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin     worked before   this? A little company called Atieva, now known as    Lucid  Motors!  One  thing I  want    to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen  mentioned     regarding “bad reviews” from employees online about  Seres   (Glassdoor I    believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern  and    uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will     function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will   be    the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable   team    and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May,  and    Seres  had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers.  The     combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships  of     trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the  eventual     dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if  most of  these    reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific  people  in the    company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He  did get  into it    with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to  his ousting  at Tesla.    At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in  less than a  year and he   took  people along with him to another EV   startup.  Doesn't sound like   much  of a team player.  Seres   ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive      overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be      producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad  to    be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.  **Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**  Well,   they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the      existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and      R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is      already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work      needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and      warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these  cars.     This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve  many     aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS-AIR. The high  volume of     existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their  advantage as     well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections  or reach that     this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then  of course, the     amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and  already invested   Sokon development, is well over  half a billion  dollars. Nice.  VI. Is This A Chinese Company?  The    last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the      important question of: “Is this a Chinese company or not?”  **The short and easy answer is NO.**  **ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**  **They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**  Sokon      will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla      supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply   for the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design    for   the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS    cannot  go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as    possible  in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making     sure they  can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its     customers.  “Hey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it’s     American,” he  said. “Our  engineers are here. The software guys. The     homologation is  all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to    source  the majority  of our EV  systems and componentry here in the    U.S.    “You’ll be going  into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys.    I’d say  there’s a low  chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,” Taylor    said. “But  after we’re  finished, it should  be looked at as just a  few   parts from  China. If we  move all the way  into vertical  integration,   we’re like  everybody  else. I’m not sure we  can hang  onto that price   point.”  So as  we can  see, there is some  strategy  here at play in   order to secure  some of  these early and first  mover  advantage   contracts.  VII. Technical Analysis  Had      to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much      nothing  overly bearish or bullish. ELMS broke below resistance the  past   2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise  above     it and  turn it from resistance back into support.  📷VIII. Conclusion  If      you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China     and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much     more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing   new    company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this    looking   to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and    seemingly  void  or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came   out  the  other end  a  changed man.

Although entertaining, “NIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!” comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it’s cold AF outside.  So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don’t like these stocks.  **1. Positions**  [https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.  A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.  **2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**  Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.  Current PS as of 2/10/2021  \- TSLA: \~25  \- NIO: \~40  \- XPENG: \~41  \- LI: \~19 (It’s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)  Let’s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let’s look at high margin tech anyways.  \- NFLX: \~10  \- ABNB: \~28  \- PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)  Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma’s teets  \- TM: \~0.8  \- F: \~0.4  \- VWAGY: \~0.5  I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don’t ask me how I did that, the answer either won’t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what’s important right now.  Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn’t change  \- TSLA: \~22  \- NIO: \~29  \- XPENG: \~26  \- LI: \~14  Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it’s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king’s girlfriend.  Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.  Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.  **3. Revenue Growth Stunted**  You might be one of those Stocktwats and you’re thinking; “but but... they’ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!” \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won’t and here is why.  Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They’re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn’t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.  Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you’re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug’s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.  TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you’re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?  NIO: 100% SUVs  Xpeng: 40% SUVs  Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking “Well, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.” Fine, let’s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.  Let’s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs  Tesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800  \- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)  \- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s  \- Charger network: 20,000+  NIO EC6  \- Price: \~$57,200  \- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)  \- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s  \- Charger network: 290+  Xpeng G3 520  \- Price: \~$30,580  \- Range: 520 km  \- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s  \- Charger network: 866+  You may be thinking the G3 520’s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you’ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.  “But JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It’s perfect for China’s dense cities!” If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That’s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I’d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can’t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I’m Chinese and know some first hand) don’t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.  Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.  Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla’s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.  “But JJ… China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!” Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.  Solar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn’t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.  Oh and let’s not forget about autonomy… no, let’s forget about it (for now).  International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a ""made in china"" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.  Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it’ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.  **4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**  History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was ""made in china"" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).  Let’s look at the current state of margins.  Q3 2020 Gross Margins  \- Tesla: 23.5%  \- Nio: 12.9%  \- Xpeng: 4.6%  \- Li Auto: 19.8%  We’ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it’s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla’s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.  “But JJ, that’s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!” First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier “ramp” years.  2017: 18.9%  2016: 22.8%  2015: 22.8%  This may not look right, something must be wrong you’re thinking. Well, let’s we take a look under the hood, you won’t find Trayvon Martin.  \- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the “skateboard” design, saying it’s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!  \- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.  [https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)  Can you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?  \- Tesla’s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.  \- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron’s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.  \- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.  \- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources  \- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network  \- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*  \- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn’t trust Nio and Xpeng’s software with your wife’s boyfriend’s life  **5. Closing**  Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let’s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?  CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.  I’m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it’s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I’ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.  At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I’ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.  TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9041031|public|confidence|self|Celebrate Chinese New Year with PUTS on $NIO &amp; $XPEV, Wish Me Luckin|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'hkfPat1cVtLGAIz1tAV6og1utgNSfM577ZAGcXXhByY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QYId13xGGvi2VCkqY9sE1nEa5so9l35T6GsyChzN3_c.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2db895b8d6627f0ec21e9f5129243e48627c3bfa', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QYId13xGGvi2VCkqY9sE1nEa5so9l35T6GsyChzN3_c.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a8939f9d4e30cbd6776e7469aca9e1122a502cc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QYId13xGGvi2VCkqY9sE1nEa5so9l35T6GsyChzN3_c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1bd3b0832b8ed84d26c0e198d1e070388d02a91', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 315, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QYId13xGGvi2VCkqY9sE1nEa5so9l35T6GsyChzN3_c.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=024c9499bd4b482540773b9c1cd9e99e0f75f2fa', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-02-14|FORD

Price break below support, break below trend, enter time of sad! But then other monkee buy! Say cheap! Stock price wedge! And lots monkee buy! So price break through wedge and resistance!  You see, monkee, wedge is strong, big pressure. If stock go up though wedge mean BIG UP! If stock go down through wedge mean BIG SAD! Like hole in coconut, stock pour!  But here, stock break free! Like hole in clouds. Stock go BIG UP!  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/f5q4s9adjhh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11ddf4912effb68d1db41af08442c9a9bb4ec3be  Wedge easy see.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/4m4n280hjhh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669d72d4af09fa42879f2bee98a167a3cf2d7b9a  Wedge again?

Monkee see. BIG UPS! Stock price break free of wedge and downwards trend! Stock is only go up!  &amp;#x200B;  **BUT ACTUALLY STOCK GO DOWN FIRST**  No be sad, monkee. All come up come down. Many monkee say ""Stock too much up, too much banana.""  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/i77cmbp2khh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a2b33c3edc6f605d724d0e8d4b06847df3e4842  This MACD chart.

If river cross snake, big down. If snake cross river, big up! Now, river cross snake, so probably big down coming. **BUT NOT ALWAYS TRUE!**  That is why, monkee, monkee see many charts. Monkee see many indicators! Monkee smart, monkee guess and check!  **Monkee look at Bolinger Bands next!**  https://preview.redd.it/ho2ozvyjkhh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45c9e04887e3083354c66e8b9b562191d2ff0b76  This call Bolinger. Bolinger maker man say ""When price is big in bolinger, price is overprice."" and ""When price is low in Bolinger, price is underprice."" Monkee see, in Bolinger, price is overprice.   Bolinger also show if price is making ups too fast and downs too fast. When bolinger big, price ups and downs too fast! So you see, price making too big ups too big downs.  Not only this. Also Bolinger maker man say ""When Bolinger is get more skinny, trend become backwards."" So you see monkee, up trend be down trend soon!  But still! Monkee careful. No want lose banana! So monkee do more DD, be good monkee. Because last week, monkee lose all money on $GME and $SNDL. Bad monkee! Monkee no listen to reddit!  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1fdr4xr0mhh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=677be91c0f44beece9c4a75d0551c608e4f31ec2  Monkee check RSI! RSI very good. When RSI in middle, stonk OK! When RSI is high, TOO MUCH MONKEE BUY! If stonk above purple, STONK IN DANGER, SELL NOW!  Not only this, but if RSI and STONK no match, mean trend go backwards! Name of this is called ""Divergence"". But little monkey head don't worry big words.  What monkee see is difference in graph. Stonk say I go up! RSI say I go down. Stock BIG UP when few monkee buy?! Not good. When this happen, listen to RSI. Bubble pop soon!  Some stupid man say ""NO! RSI NO MEAN TOO MUCH BUY OR SELL!"" But monkee, this how other monkee use RSI. And RSI very popular. So many other monkee now think same. So many monkee is want sell.  *IF MONKEE WANT TO LOOK BY SELF, MONKEE SEE THAT RSI PREDICT $GME AND $SNDL BIG DOWN! MONKEE NO LOSE ALL BANANA IF LOOK AT RSI! Monkee sad, monkee learn, monkee make banana.*  &amp;#x200B;  **So what monkee talk to you think? Go up? Go down?**  https://preview.redd.it/enx89a2wnhh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de5816d5b7c721e230e49b7965858bd9511a4ece  You see monkee, $F boring STONK! That why good for learn, good for trade. $F make boring car, not cool car like big dongerino friend $TSLA and friend Musk.  $F is sleepy, like follow trend. You see last $F go too much big from up trend so $F big crash and then go up again. Or even go down after.  So monkee talk to you think say this happen again.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qypwuqgjohh61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0acc3a8cc0a3e2318258a1d29bee01549a699290  Stock go up again with up trend, but first stock come down. No be sad. Monkee buy puts. Then when big down sell puts buy calls! Many banana! Ho ho ho!  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR: AWOOOGA!**  * Too big up in trend * Too many monkee buy * Now cost up too much * River cross

I am predicting this will change this year. Toyota will probably make an announcement in that regard in order to compete with Ford, Kia, Tesla and other automakers already embracing electrics.   With their vast hybrid lineup and their own proprietary battery production capacity, I think that any such announcement will send them rocketing.   By the time they do, you will have already missed the initial jump.

Of course it left a sour but familiar taste in the mouths of Lisa Su's cuck army and AMD fanboys. Today I'm here with another treat for you, don't be shy I know deep down you like it.   Honestly Intel has so many juicy bits of DD to squeeze out its hard to pick where to start.   [from Intel's 10K pg17](https://preview.redd.it/oxulb5pl7ah61.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1d4f2b7e110578ceafa5d0cb790a7fb85d476d)  Nevertheless I know you are hungry so Ill start with an appetizer.   Mobileye  Don't be fooled, If Mobileye was an independent company it would probably be you guys' main dish and desert after it had been pumped to a 100B market cap like many of the ""tech of the future"" sector stocks. The reality is, Mobileye is the future and the 100B market cap would probably not be that outlandish in this market. One word:  Autonomous vehicles.  That's right, a market that is in its most infant state but that has the potential to be bigger than the United Kingdoms economy by 2030.   Don't take it from me ""The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2021 ad reach $1,191.8 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $1,642.9 billion in 2025 growing at a CAGR of 17.4%, and $3,195.0 billion in 2030 growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. ""1\*  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img g8cc9qtt9ah61...*  Mobileye is one of the leaders in the autonomous vehicle industry and is poised not just to grow in market share but to take over. Last year they brought in for Intel a cool Billion, yeah I know its nothing much, its just double AMDs net earnings last quarter and about 1 and a bit% of Intel's annual revenues. Oh yeah I know you must be seething at the way I am phrasing this.   Professor Amnon Shashua (CEO of Mobileye) who you will be calling Daddy very soon when your asymmetric relationship with Su Bae doesn't work out had some interesting things to say this year, "" Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1  across over 25 OEMs.""   Intel also acquired Moovit to facilitate Mobileyes dominance, ""We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.""  Fuck Tesla fake autonomous driving program, when the robo taxis do come they will have mobileye in them.   Intel bought Mobileye for 15.3 Billion $ in March 2017 when they were at the start of a year that brought them 200 million $ in revenue. You see what I mean when I say this could be valued at 100B in market cap given the current market (Its a type of bubble(might not pop but its still a bubble), IDGAF what you say).   But Intel's market cap is only 250B? What's going on here Mr Market? Have you been eating crayons? Its alright, a little nudge and you will wake up.   By buying Intel you are in effect able to buy a stake in the future of autonomous vehicles at tremendous discount.   Like I said, this is just a little treat. Intel is a full meal and it has a lot to give.  1700 INTC shares, 500 April 16th 80$ strike calls and yesterday before close I added a little 50 Feb 26th 65$ strikes for good measure. Your wife's boyfriend is counting on you to be smart and by Intel calls or you wont be able to subsidize their trip to the Maldives.

Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between vehicles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We are a **premier provider** of AI- powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles, including one of the world’s most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants, such as “Hey BMW” and “Ni hao Banma”.     **Market Capitalization:**      Cerence has a market cap of just **$5 billion**. As a play on two of the hottest growth segments (EV and AI), Cerence has and likely will continue to see prolific growth.       **Customer Profile:**      **CERENCE products are in 53% OF ALL NEW CARS SHIPPED in 2020. This equates to 38 MILLION cars alone in 2020 and 325 million vehicles to date.**         Customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including BMW, Daimler, FCA Group, Ford, Geely, GM, Renault-Nissan, SAIC, Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, DENSO TEN and Harman. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between their brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone.         **Competitive Strengths: ** (directly from 10K)      **Industry-leading speech-related technology**        **Hybrid edge-cloud system architecture** Our software platform’s hybrid architecture combines the performance, reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity.       **Bespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning** Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation, entertainment and control require tight integration with onboard vehicle components, which vary widely among vehicle models. Separately, speech interaction systems can be significantly hampered by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components. To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns, our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models.       **Broad language coverage** Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects, far more than any of our competitors. As a result of our broad language support, our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform in over 60 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including China, the U.S. and all other large automotive markets. Our language support also enables multi-lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection, point-of-interest selection, and cross-border navigation among others, representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones. We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi-lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage, as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time-consuming.       **Broad, global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers** We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years, working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands.       **Competitors:** A real DD always addresses the competitive landscape.     **Large technology companies** Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, offer Internet-based virtual assistants. Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants, we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience.        **Small, focused competitors** We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice-based virtual assistance, including SoundHound in the U.S., iFlyTek in China, and other regional and technology-focused competitors. These companies have had some success selling into our customer base. However, we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages, including our scale, our globally distributed team, our best-in-class portfolio of compatible languages, and our deep focus on the automotive market. We also believe that our technology, particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning, is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors. We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings.       **Competitors (My analysis):**       I appreciate that Cerence's auditors make sure they address all potential risks. However, I do not see big tech as a threat. I see them as a ""gain-guarantee."" Cerence's AI is years ahead of the big players and Cerence’s small peers. The biggest risk I see here is that a company--ahem like AAPL or Google--might purchase Cerence. Cerence's market cap makes it a likely candidate of a buyout in the future.        **Revenues:**       Revenues are up to $326 Million for fiscal year 2020. **$95 Million in Q1 2021** literally on pace for 25% revenue growth. [Here’s a chart with Revenue growth for the last three years]( https://imgur.com/a/eNKnHnR)        **Gross Margin:**     72% gross margin in the most recent fiscal quarter. Huge margins which is extremely attractive.    **Research and Development:**       The best expense on the income statement in my opinion. Cerence has had negative net incomes in the past few fiscal years due primarily to R&amp;D costs. This maintains and expands their already vast competitive advantage.       “We believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market-leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities.”    **Balance Sheet:**      $1,700,000,000 assets to $700,000,000 liabilities. For my finance guys, a 1.37 current ratio. $266 bil in LTD.            Goodwill is a concentrated risk that makes up most of their assets (over $1 billion). Definitely not the best.     **Cash flows:**      Cash flow from op positive.

I have included TLDRs at the beginning of the post because I know we are all illiterate and lazy autists.  Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.  TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.  TLDR (Part 1): Oshkosh has excellent management in place with a great track record not only maintaining market share in its current sectors. It has grown every year since CEO has been put in place except for the Covid year. The OSK team has been working hard to get into the electric commercial vehicle space, and it looks promising.  Oshkosh’s Pilot will navigate us through the Stars and to the end of the Universe.  Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate that provides products to access equipment, defense, fire &amp; emergency, and commercial sectors. It was founded in 1917. It is a business that has been around longer than the boomers we know in our lives. Since it has survived multiple recessions and depressions, it will not be going anywhere.  The CEO of the company is Wilson R Jones, and he has been with the company since 2005 as general manager and in other roles. He has been the President/CEO since 2016, and the company has seen growth year after year. This guy is like a fucking wizard that only knows how to grow. The company did take a hit in 2020, and so did basically any companies that didn’t facilitate stay at home orders and the pain of Covid (eg. Zoom).   During Wilson’s tenure, the stock price of OSK went from around $30 to $100. This growth in stock price isn’t just due to the markets being hotter than my neighbor next door. The revenue of OSK from 2016-2019 went from 6.28B  to 8.38B, and the EBIT of OSK went from $367M to $805M. During 2020 the revenue dropped to 6.82B, and the EBIT dropped to $406M. The company took a dip, but are we really going to hold that against him? He has a track record of performing, but you can’t do anything if there is a black swan event. ([Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/financials?p=OSK))  Wilson and the OSK team aren’t satisfied with its current business sectors. They have been building relationships and joint ventures to dominate the commercial EV space. Their notable partners entering the commercial EV space are [FORD](https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/) and [Microvast](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005668/en/Oshkosh-Corporation-partners-with-Microvast-to-strengthen-electrification-capabilities). Their first mission is to swoop in and steal the USPS contract from Workhorse, like how my wife’s boyfriend stole my wife away from me. I hate that fucker. I will talk more about this later on.  The management team has a strong track record, and they are only looking up and beyond just the moon. They will navigate us through the stars and into another galaxy.  In the next post, I will talk more about the valuation given to OSK and why it is a steal even if they didn’t plan on providing electric commercial vehicles for USPS.

Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):  \- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.  * Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform. * BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology. * BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles. * BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**  **Okay, so why is this important?**  1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles. 2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.** 3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\* 4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**  Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.  **The Sobering Part of this DD:**  After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.  I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**  **Final Thoughts:**  Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though.

We've become pimps for equities: prop 'em up to make them look pretty and sell them off to a troglodyte infested with STD's. We need to change the way we see stocks as a piece of a company that offers potentially good returns with a little bit of patience and gambling. Get-rich-quick schemes, as we have seen throughout the last 30 days can easily turn into get-broke-even-faster gambles that ruins your wallet and stock market participation when faith is lost in the system (which is key if we want to grow retail investing to the likes off our boomer counter).   You might've heard ""you want to invest in your future."" Take it seriously. Throwing 10-50 stacks at GameStop to fend off ""short ladder attacks"" or injecting steroids into a no-name Canadian weed company that rivals the market cap of Wendy's is pretty reckless, and you deserve to lose that money when it craters. INVEST LONG TERM BUT GAMBLE WITH THE MARKET. Make sounds decisions but make bets on market conditions to fulfill your cocaine addiction.  With that said, there's a great investment opportunity in SPG (Simon Property Group). Simon is an American commercial real estate company, one of the largest REITs, and the largest shopping mall operators in the US. They had a steep selloff in March of last year, but has seen a rise of 3100 basis point YTD (31%). They have more room to climb because of stock momentum, COVID vaccines, consumer demand, and a aggressive strategy to stay ahead of competition. Despite this, they're still bullish. During the Q4 call, they remain ""confident"" that the worse is behind them, and SPG is trading at a discount of $109 to its target price consensus of $125.  In 2020 with COVID ravaging the bottom line for a lot of companies, they pulled in some impressive numbers.   **Company Statistic Over the Last Year back from December 2020**      * generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow; * acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group who specialize in super-regional and outlet shopping malls in the United States and China (China is back in business, remember?) ; * raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets * opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments; * returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid (for comparison, even though they're not a REIT, Ford suspended dividends along with many other companies) * Occupancy was 91.3% at December 31, 2020. (Doesn't even seem like COVID made a dent). * Base minimum rent per square foot was $55.80 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year.  **Chart Analysis**  They have historically been almost spot on with moving average analysis. Comparing their 50-day and 200-day moving average, they're currently on a bullish trend, positive upward momentum to a higher stock price. The short term moving average is above the long term line, thus indicating they're in for a good run in the near future.   **COVID Vaccines**  We know that the Biden administration is pushing for vaccinations. For good reason: once we're at herd immunity, states will be opening up because they're in need for revenue after incurring major expenses to keep their hospitals and small businesses staffed and opened during the height of the pandemic. Today we learned that the Biden administration is moving up their timeline to distribute vaccines after Pfizer and Moderna made a deal to provide 200 million shots. Once people are vaccinated to the threshold of herd immunity, the economy will start moving in the right direction. And, remember, Simon is trading a discount now. Once people feel more comfortable being around others, mall traffic can expect to increase.  **Summary**  I know some of you see the market as a casino, but I know a lot of you don't even have money to buy into a poker game at a low-class joint and are holding your wife's boyfriend's dicks shell-shocked at the change of market tides. But, if you bet on America, you can never go wrong. Once sentiment changes, if it has already curved in the right direction, businesses will attract the traffic. Maybe not pre-pandemic levels for some, but their stock price will rise as we get closer. SPG is primed for a return built on solid fundamentals (curse word in this sub?), an upward trend based on chart analysis, and growing confidence in our ability to be around others after much fatigue. Right now, betting on America is wagering if we can make a recovery. And when have we been unable to recover as a country?"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8948359|public|confidence|self|#SaveTheMalls for a Good Long-Term (Yes, the Dreaded Word on WSB) Investment Opportunity|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhz5dw/savethemalls_for_a_good_longterm_yes_the_dreaded/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-02-12|FORD

Microvast is already an established battery company (100m revenue, 1.5bil in contracts through 2027) with a 20min charging batt and most of their clients are larger vehicles, i.e. buses, vans. You may have seen it jump 70% to 25 just to pull back to about 20 over the last 2 weeks.  **Oshkosh**  Oshkosh recently entered a ""strategic development"" with Microvast, and just the other day the news broke that Microvast is building a factory in Tennessee (read: US-based). Oshkosh (OSK) also invested 25m into Microvast in this move. This new Tennessee factory represents their third one, but importantly their first in the US. The other two are in china and Germany.  **USPS Contract**  So recently there has been talk about the USPS contract, and whether garbage-on-wheels WKHS will get it. obviously this would represent an upwards rocket for WKHS so maybe an options play is worth it , idk I'm no greeks savant.  Folks here have made the point that WKHS is the only fully electric EV-maker in the ring still, and therefore they have the upper hand to win the contract. Meanwhile OSK submitted a contract which included some gas vehicles. (it is worth noting that the USPS contract does not ask for 100% electric, allowing for some gas) But seeing as WKHS is not really at scale (at all), and the democrats whole identity is saying the exciting thing (EV USPS Fleet) and doing another less exciting (some gas some electric) and Oshkosh is an established player in government contracts, I think they have the upper hand. But Oshkosh is already work 6b, is splitting the contract with Ford, and is still a govt manufacturer. The upside here is limited.  **Manufacturing**  This is a big point that I haven't seen adequately addressed. The OSK competitors simply don't have the infrastructure set up to produce the number of trucks needed to supply the USPS.  WKHS - Owns 10% of a factory in Lordstown  Karsan - partners with Michigan factory but is only an electric engine, not full truck. USPS needs new vehicles as the old ones are prone to breakdown/fires.  Oshkosh/Ford - Duh massive US manufacturing capacity.  **Microvast as the Growth Play**  Microvast is clearly positioning themselves to benefit from the US vehicle electrification age. The battery shortage is just beginning and Microvast is set to land some big contracts either way. But OSK winning the USPS contract and contracting Microvast for some of the battery tech would give the company a new shine. It is worth mentioning that the company has trash PR. just look at their website. If this happens I'm expecting THC🐝 to break 30.  **Quick Technicals**  No funky lines but this is a SPAC. It trades on news and deadlines. The definitive agreement pumped it up and now its bleeding until either merger or good Microvast news. With a small float, this stock will rocket on this news, and probably won't sink below 17 without it.  The stock also just got options, which could play into a nice run.  **Positions**  I'm jacked to the tits with 750 commons, 2k warrants. This play represents over half my portfolio lol.  **P.S.**  This thing just has my spidey (read: Dem hater) senses tingling. Its the exact type of deal that the govt likes to make, satisfies all the PR necessities etc. How much THC🐝/Microvast stands to gain from this deal is unclear, but OSK winning the contract is obvious imo."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8925673|public|confidence|self|Betting WKHS on the USPS Contract?

It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.  In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.  Part 1: History of Self Promotion  Part 2: The USPS Contract  Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability  Part 4: Positions or Ban  \---------------  **PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**  WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:  * [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)    * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more? * [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)    * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a ""blue chip customer.""](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)  * Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016    * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html) * Several other small examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered. * Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER. * [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)    * Let's take a look at that fine print: ""The order is split between Workhorse’s C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions."" Yeah, we'll see how that goes.  \---------------  **PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**  There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.  First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:  * Workhorse * Ford-Oshkosh * Karsan-Morgan Olsen  *I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel bull arguments below.*  Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):  1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15. 2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/) 3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney. 4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles    1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.    2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing. 5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).  So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.  I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:  &gt;“We’ve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I’ll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we’re ready for that. Now we’ve got our fingers crossed. We believe we’ve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,” John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.   &gt;   &gt;Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)  And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):  &gt;**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**   &gt;   &gt;I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS’s needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?   &gt;   &gt;**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**   &gt;   &gt;So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.   &gt;   &gt;**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**   &gt;   &gt;I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.  So USPS has the following options:  1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch. 2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).  Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]  \---------------  PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY  I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say ""Lordstown"" like it means something.  This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.  \---------------  **PART 4: YOLO**  Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.  *Processing img rgsgv499lsg61...*  *Processing img yvpad8aglsg61...*  [9k Workhorse Puts \(short-term\)](https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38fb339ee6e4153b592bdb01f4313ddf375024dc)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8891287|public|confidence|self|WKHS DD: Zero chance of winning a significant portion of USPS contract|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lheq8x/wkhs_dd_zero_chance_of_winning_a_significant/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'sLOCiRxhdZsf8WGj_vh5YsbeIThXuDzhMYx67eHtWjg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I-TcvRl-rtzruGEcsHfuHE-k2Y2UIYBroem0bM3sZR8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d1498ce9be24daa25f992473653c6ad3f4e0ade', 'width': 108}, {'height': 145, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I-TcvRl-rtzruGEcsHfuHE-k2Y2UIYBroem0bM3sZR8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8231f066fa5553f1a4bfa6c8c5388b7068d95a26', 'width': 216}, {'height': 215, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I-TcvRl-rtzruGEcsHfuHE-k2Y2UIYBroem0bM3sZR8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae6a5d60b730f583211b939b6087aad65aa3ccf', 'width': 320}, {'height': 430, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I-TcvRl-rtzruGEcsHfuHE-k2Y2UIYBroem0bM3sZR8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=151c5b38b9cbca0e3fb5e4460626b74fc95a6b1d', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 559, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I-TcvRl-rtzruGEcsHfuHE-k2Y2UIYBroem0bM3sZR8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0291281204395b0fb906e8a6f021172c09d54fac', 'width': 831}, 'variants': {}}]}|{'b7wqswymlsg61': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'b7wqswymlsg61', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2cc02825b13c61385904d2dafc6fe4ce828a1f3', 'x': 108, 'y': 27}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9fc5ea38d4063b4b91d65c4a4b2e61aad5f5ab', 'x': 216, 'y': 54}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=264aa0d494c01575ae23bff1b0efc44aafae649a', 'x': 320, 'y': 80}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35454ef935976d55c4b2ed55bc8e721edf7c4cc0', 'x': 640, 'y': 160}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=796e3cd527823a528389f82eb4fef5a46bbb5f22', 'x': 960, 'y': 241}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38fb339ee6e4153b592bdb01f4313ddf375024dc', 'x': 1018, 'y': 256}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'rgsgv499lsg61': {'status': 'failed'}, 'yvpad8aglsg61': {'status': 'failed'}}|||||||||||2021-02-11|FORD

Long time commenter, first time DD’er; and I am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this DD. This is for pure autistinal personnel.  This is my take on a lot of DD going around WKHS. This is NOT an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will ‘stick to the HFs’. Fuck that I’m just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with y’all to get rich; if you like them great! If you don’t, great, but also fuck. This is also not technical analysis. I can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but I really believe that you cannot use TA to predict the USPS. Sources for technicals are at the bottom.  WKHS price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the USPS contract. They (the USPS) have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets USPS’s $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governor’s meeting that occurred this week. Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the president’s Zero-Emission initiative. Let’s pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and I’ll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:     -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet     -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles     -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)     -OSK/F’s submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)     -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA     -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players     -WKHS has patents and improvements to ‘last-mile’ delivery  But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Let’s talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvee’s and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $706.2mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.  Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:     -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.028     -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.012     -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600  The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.  Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $10.10 to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $8.08. So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive? 1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg 2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime 3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up “to get exercise” = way more time for delivery   The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.  With all this being said it’s obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:  Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.  Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.  Scenario Three: 20% chance: They can’t come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.  Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.  TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.  My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32C’s at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19 Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.  &gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.  *****  &gt; # 3. Twitter is ‘bigger than any one account,’ CEO says  &gt; * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday’s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is “bigger than any one account,” said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.  *****  &gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments  &gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump’s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he’s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.  *****  &gt; # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing  &gt; * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/UcNjYBi.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jzsj6V4.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bEWgiAZ.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K690R0u.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/NGnaqee.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vLhBS2V.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1p6W5Oy.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qxoyyCv.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9Jx5owU.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/I9j8fVZ.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/iAjNlv8.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1MVWFH6.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xZ56Gwf.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2MZhVwY.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-under-armour-twitter-bunge-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Coca-Cola (KO)** – Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates.

We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.  The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).  The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.  I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.  What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.  Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.  Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.  The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.  The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.  Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out.

55 shares @ $36.22 (Not a big position, but whatever, it's what I could afford.)  The Low-Down:  Workhorse ($WKHS) is an EV commercial truck manufacturer primed to moon. They're one of the finalists for the $6 billion USPS contract to replace the old, outdated postal trucks with shiny, new, sexy trucks. This contract was supposed to be awarded in December but got delayed. We can expect the results within the next month.  The two other finalists are Karsan, a truck manufacturer from TURKEY and OshKosh/Ford who are putting up an ICE truck (but have said they could pivot to an EV if required).  Now, the contract itself isn't for an EV truck however adding fuel to the fire (acid to the battery?) in support of WKHS is that Biden wants the entire federal fleet to be zero emission. This is great news.  Also, WKHS is based in Ohio, American made and a union company. If your pecker isn't half chubbed and saluting at those words, then honestly you're a pinko commie un-Murrican bastard. And you can bet your ass that is being factored into the decision as to who to award. You really think that they're going to give this money to the Turks? No, this administration knows it has to pay at least lip service to American manufacturing and union support. And honestly, as Americans, that's shit that we should be supporting, too.  Their debt is around 70 million right now, which pales in comparison to the money they'll be getting if (when) they get the USPS contract.  EDIT: Oh yeah, and their short interest (SI) is around 27%, which you idiots who got spoiled @ &gt;100% may scoff at, but is still pretty high in the normal world.  TL;DR - Don't be an idiot and sleep and WKHS. It's a great long-term play but I also believe it has potential for healthy short term gains.  EDIT 2: To put forth the other argument for why the OshKosh/Ford truck could beat out WKHS, so you see the other side of the argument: both OshKosh and Ford already have their tenterhooks in the government and definitely could win the contract. Also, as an astute person pointed out: the USPS currently doesn't have the infrastructure to support a full EV fleet, meaning that OshKosh/Ford's offering may be an easier transition.   However, I don't think these necessarily weaken WKHS's position at all. Granted, I could be putting WAY too much stock in a cynical/political POV with this, but the way that I see it is that the contract is going to be 'weaponized' to be about more than just replacing the aged USPS fleet and will instead be something to tout as a green victory for the administration. Which I believe is overall a great step in the right direction and something we all should be happy about but let's be honest: decision makers understand optics and a PR release that says ""USPS moving their entire fleet to 0 emissions"" will play a lot better than ""USPS adopts new truck. Plans to move to 0 emissions by 2030"""|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8658010|public|confidence|self|You're an idiot if you don't have some WKHS in your stable|2.0|[]|0.81|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcl2oj/youre_an_idiot_if_you_dont_have_some_wkhs_in_your/|some_ads|7.0||||||||1612461534.0||||||||2021-02-04|FORD

Positions: 230 $15c Jan 2022  https://preview.redd.it/quhsl8g03hf61.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1b2bda4d0ecf816f47d8986b8dd241603ea2e7  First of all, fuck the suits and GME 💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍 I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.  **It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.  If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.  If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.  **Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.  **So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.  GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.  So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).  **Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars.

Just a thought I had. We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers have been saying it’s overvalued for the last I don’t know how long, or in a bubble (which, in all reality could be true).  However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft, Ford pairing with Google, and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the EV bandwagon.   This got me thinking. Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford’s market cap is literally half of NIO’s (who has 7,000 employees). It’s hard to justify, in my mind at least.  I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional automakers  have in comparison to these other startups gives them a HUGE advantage.  But now that these guys are finally making their own EV’s, I think investors are starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well in the near future.  I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but very rarely that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an “energy company” and blah blah blah. What do y’all think? Am I stupid?

One thing I found interesting is that not only does short volume for GME increase to greater than 50% of total volume on Jan 27, but on Jan 28, the Exempt Short Sale Volume increases significantly as a percent of total volume (\~6x increase from 27th to 29th).  As we all know the 28th is the day that brokerages were forced to shut off memestocks and when we saw what many have claimed to be a major coordinated attack to drive down the price over the course of a few minutes to trigger long margin calls and stop loss orders.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ebhlm72bhbf61.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d929d552fb4e5d7093b620e78db0f47baceb7d89  Here is what this same data looks like for some other securities over the same time frame. I took particular note that BB had a sudden increase in this exempt short volume which seems to match up with a sudden downward movement in its price yesterday morning. Although the overall short volume decreases, so not sure what total impact that had on the price.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ojjznv7chbf61.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a9b2d7d33db7245070f9dc29f55156823e1818  https://preview.redd.it/k20vscdfhbf61.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d3a4032695aab1846d2650bfed81c881238d6ac  https://preview.redd.it/dxd1w5bhhbf61.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c2ea725b230382428c716d8438aa87ffc417428  https://preview.redd.it/os1hyvtlhbf61.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ff15ba690eda9513d6f5d4751bf8792550fedeb  https://preview.redd.it/u437clwuhbf61.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecb57b8d352b4116f6bd0ae07698a33addbf282  What is Exempt short volume? Here is how investopedia describes it:  ""Though the SEC oversees brokers who issue short-sale orders, they do not execute regularly scheduled audits or required regularly filed reports by brokers. Instead, the SEC expects broker-dealers to be self regulating, by maintaining their own records which are subject to audit at any time. With this in mind, broker-dealers are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their documented policies and procedures.  Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. That means that if prices come in outside the [National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp), they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets. Marking for these orders is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation SHO exceptions.""  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp)  I don't know jack shit about what this means, and I'm not a financial advisor, which is why I'm asking for someone who knows more about this to explain the significance of this. Does this help support the argument that Hedgies/brokers are circumventing the NBBO for ladder attacks when LULD rule is triggered? Were there frequent enough trading halts since Jan 28th for this to have a significant impact? AAPL and Ford have very small but non-existent data for Exempt short volume, and I'm not aware of any limit rules applied to them over the last few days, so where did their exempt short volume come from?  My position is \~50 shares of GME at \~$120. Small long positions in some of the other securities mentioned, but GME is by far the biggest."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8623143|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/O1wsBPd3b2KFkfFrUdIUlUafXg3oRUyqFL_EB6YZnig.jpg|"Sharp increase in ""Exempt Short

I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion. Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).  Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19  There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls  1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr! 2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently)  3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video) 4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars). 5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet  It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8608757|public|confidence|self|Fuck TSLA, NIO, and GM -&gt; Go for Ford 🚀🚀💎|0.0|[]|0.43|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjl9e/fuck_tsla_nio_and_gm_go_for_ford/|some_ads|7.0||||||||1612344222.0||||||||2021-02-03|FORD

I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.  Desktop Metal (DM) DD  DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.  The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.  Pros :  1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.  2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.  3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.  4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.  5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.  6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.  7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.  8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.  9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.  Cons :  1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.  2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc  (More cons are welcome)  My positions:  100 shares at $21.35  7 calls for $40 05/21, 9 calls for $35 05/21, 1 call for $20 05/21  Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!  Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.  PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

Listen up retards,  I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.  BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.  The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark “for their secure productivity needs.”  [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity-802136475.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity-802136475.html)  Samsung Knox uses BlackBerry Spark  [https://www.samsungknox.com/en/partner-solutions/blackberry-spark](https://www.samsungknox.com/en/partner-solutions/blackberry-spark)  They “won” the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.  [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-shares-rise-after-facebook-agrees-to-settle-lawsuit-over/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-shares-rise-after-facebook-agrees-to-settle-lawsuit-over/)  Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)  [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-shares-rise-after-facebook-agrees-to-settle-lawsuit-over/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-shares-rise-after-facebook-agrees-to-settle-lawsuit-over/)  Blackberry and Baidu have teamed up to work on autonomous cars in China  [https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/blackberry-and-baidu-deepen-autonomous-connected-car-partnership/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/blackberry-and-baidu-deepen-autonomous-connected-car-partnership/)  Automotive companies fuck with QNX (article is outdated) they say its in 175 million cars now  [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles#:\~:text=Automotive%20OEMs%20and%20tier%20ones,%2C%20KIA%2C%20Maserati%2C%20Mercedes%2D](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles#:~:text=Automotive%20OEMs%20and%20tier%20ones,%2C%20KIA%2C%20Maserati%2C%20Mercedes%2D)  Also the deal with Amazon.  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/blackberry-stock-price-record-rally-automotive-software-deal-amazon-bb-2020-12-1029854658](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/blackberry-stock-price-record-rally-automotive-software-deal-amazon-bb-2020-12-1029854658)  Also I think the CEO is very motivated to make it work with 5 million in shares being locked up until the stock can reach $16-20 over a 10-day trading average. Also the sweet sweet $90 mill if he can get the stock to $30 before November of 2023.  [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blackberry-ceo-john-chen-has-millions-of-reasons-to-love-wallstreetbets-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blackberry-ceo-john-chen-has-millions-of-reasons-to-love-wallstreetbets-2021-01-27)  While I don’t think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think it’s a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday  But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.  Not financial advice.  Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)  Edit2: Saw some talk about Ford ditching QNX but it looks like they will still support Sync (and Apple Car Play) in new cars so not sure how that's going to work  Last edit promise: No buying limits on $BB on any platform as far as I can tell.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8598923|public|confidence|self|$BB is a good company|14.0|[]|0.93|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbcs7g/bb_is_a_good_company/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'hN3SsNt6ht2SpguwnaBdzWL6Yn47kb6GRKOMq8lNlEE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uI3-TG6TYTjFI5f9LuRTRcZzrTXp7Juhyuf4kbNbzzU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac58fa6bb04529b38580b4dbae78ff29bd046cd4', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uI3-TG6TYTjFI5f9LuRTRcZzrTXp7Juhyuf4kbNbzzU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecacbed14789e6889731c695607dc5bd5dde3cf7', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uI3-TG6TYTjFI5f9LuRTRcZzrTXp7Juhyuf4kbNbzzU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44752da62bbee71899f9fb960d35004cd25c2493', 'width': 320}, {'height': 337, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uI3-TG6TYTjFI5f9LuRTRcZzrTXp7Juhyuf4kbNbzzU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d39af0d96a2d18373e0273d38c17ba5530a85ad', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 419, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uI3-TG6TYTjFI5f9LuRTRcZzrTXp7Juhyuf4kbNbzzU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d2e53ed6252d7ee4da57418485537f85c10b487b', 'width': 794}, 'variants': {}}]}||||1612323523.0|1.0|||||||2021-02-03|FORD

down your pitchforks and stop raging at Robinhood and read about the next moonshot for 5 min...  TLDR for you retards who don’t have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.  **Summary** 🚀🚀  XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.  **The players**🚀🚀  Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.  Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.  Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.  **Application**🚀🚀  The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here’s how:  - XL’s hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.  - Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.  - XL grid is XL’s charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites.   These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.  ** Other Info**🚀🚀  - On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine  - Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola.   - The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a “Buy America” executive order that creates new guidelines for the government’s $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity  🚀🚀- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. 🚀🚀  **TLDR**  XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and we’ve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri.   Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and 🏳️‍🌈🐻, but do so with XL fleet in mind.    Giraffe out.

I purchased Ford on Friday based on a technical pattern hoping for a quick swing.  Today Ford announced a six-year partnership with a Google.  What was intended to be a short hold, has no turned into oh shit!...this could be huge. Everyone knows that every EV company out there has exploded higher over the last year including anyone with anything related to autonomous driving as a business channel.  $F has performed... well like ford. The stock is in the 10’s.  However this could change things big time.    With further initial research I found that Fords head of global design Moray Callum (square looking old white guy in a suit) has retired and they have recently hired Anthony Lo.  I looked into this guy and he has led the design of some badass cars I’ve seen, including this one https://www.saabplanet.com/saab-aero-x-anthony-lo/  I’m still putting the pieces together and doing my DD but is $F a potential big time tendie over the next few years?   Anyone have thoughts?

Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let’s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.  We saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers.   So, let’s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It’s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.  We also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.  Meanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.  This week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.  In some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021🚀🚀🚀, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla’s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.  Meanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn’t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites🚀🚀🚀.  The recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) 🚀🚀🚀, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than ¾ of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.  Interactive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.  So… I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second… this one is very hard to predict… Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven’t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.🚀🚀  And finally, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).  **Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!

My father lost his restaurant manager job at a corporate chain, and my parents struggled to keep the family financially afloat.  During the bottom of the market, my dad took charge of his 401k, which had an amount way too low for someone at his age. He decided to invest it himself, and I followed up with him. At the age of 13, I bought my first two stocks, Ford and Ciiti for 2.93 and 2.72 respectively. Within a year, I had tripled my portfolio. This inspired me. I started working as a lifeguard during the summer and a waiter through the rest of the year. I saved up 80% of what I would make and invested it in the market.  At 15 I got into trading derivatives. And throughout high school, my annual returns ranged between 60 and 140%. It allowed me to build enough savings to where I didn't have to worry about rent in college. When I got my bachelor's I had the opportunity to take a gap year and cheaply travel around the world from Scotland to Ukraine to Taiwan.  I was fortunate in having both the luck and ability to get into the market at such an early age. It shaped my world view, and how I viewed the stock market in general. I never saw it as a corrupt system manipulated by hedge funds extracting money from people. I saw it for potentially being a great equaliser. Something that could potentially lift people up from their lower class status if they saved and invested.  But then as I got my Bachelor's and later my Master's in Finance and Economics my views began to change. The more I learned about Wall Street, the more I became disgusted with hedge funds gaining the system and extracting money from people and wasting resources on private jets, yachts, and extravagant mansions. They aren't even creating any value. It's just a game of who can manipulate each other the most to extract money from them.  It doesn't have to be this way though. The past week has proved this to me. If enough individuals join together they can ruin their advanced capital extracting strategies, and maybe even convince regulators to do their fucking job and put an end to these bastards stepping all over us. We have a chance now of doing what that lying bastard of a corporation Robin hood claimed they wanted to. We have a chance to truly democratise the stock market.  LETS TEACH THESE BASTARDS A LESSON!

I was looking forward to learning the lingo and trying my best to make a good side hustle.   I read news and posts and try to articulate how this has come to be, and the only way is to completely toss human greed out of the window and trust your fellow redditors. It's quite astounding and I've grown a very wholesome respect for each and every one of you.   Before, I just came here to read silly stories, hype myself by finding people who had made more money than my salary x10 in just an option, how retarded.  I tried to explain to my (not so market savvy) friends the extent of what's happening here, and how it came to be, and most importantly how proud I am. And as I do so my largest holding starts to gain traction on WSB.  I am a Canadian male, 22, I was born in British Columbia and was taken away from my mother by child protective services, she had an issue with alcohol and heroin and it was hinted that I might've had some in my system when I was born.  Child protective sent me to live with my father, who was his own cup of tea. To summarize, my father was a drug dealer and I was his accident baby, he had not the experience or will to raise me and I was neglected my early years of life. I assume he hadn't worked out with my mother as they were just having a fling.  My grandmother, fathers side, set me up an air mattress in her kitchen when I was four years old and that was when I unofficially moved out. There was lots of restless nights at my father's and id often catch the school bus with him still being awake and drunk from the night before. There were many strangers sleeping on my bed over the years.  My family and I had always had problems with poverty, my father's money was taken when he went to jail, Ive never really met my mother, and I burned through my single grandmothers savings by needing food and school supplies.  I went to college in 2017 for mechanical engineering,  I really liked it and got great grades. I met the first woman I've really, really liked there, we got along perfect.   Nearing the end of my second year she grew distant and ended up cheating on me with someone in my program, I dropped out and refused to see her again. I was on OSAP student loan program which was tanked by Doug Ford, I had to pay it all back.  Since then I have been working as a cleaner at my local courthouse, I save money in my brokerage, buy groceries for granny, and am trying to pay off her debt (abt. 9000CAD).  I don't talk to either of my parents, obviously. But I am worried because she is now 71 and showing signs of mental decline.   I was planning on going back to school, university (Bachelor of Engineering (software)/Masters of Business administration) in 2023 or 2024 if I had saved up enough to reasonably support myself, continue work, and go to school.  I sit here watching gamestop, dumbfounded, and here you are boosting my largest holding now killing my shorts. If this really works out for me I can finish school before I am thirty, and I can pay off grannys debt sooner than that even. If this works out I swear I'll come back with my degree (and proof) and I'll train you retards with the knowledge I've absorbed. Mark my words. I really feel like I could be pulled out of poverty along with my future right now. And I  owe it all to you.  I'm crossing my fingers, I've been long for a while and do not plan on selling my little nest-bags I have here. I have 1746 at .585 average in my personal, and I have 4218 at a .61 average in my tfsa. God help me. As I write this message we are booming and I'm so proud. I hold 90% of my portfolios in SNDL.

In this  -  yesterday little - today large - forum I learned so much about how the  system works. And so many others did as well.

You may have noticed a few things happening in stocks the past little while such as EV plays being popular, wsb realizing its potential power as a meme stock pumper, and, most recently, triggering short squeezes on heavily shorted stocks. If you haven't noticed any of that, don't worry, you still belong here and we accept you.      Now I want to say one thing before we get into this - **DON'T SELL GME!**      This is not some play to distract from the big kahuna. It's a potential next move and we should have a little time. So let me repeat, do not fucking sell.      Let's go ahead and get the main idea out of the way...      **TLCR;** XL Fleet is one of the many Electric Vehicle plays on the market right now. It has the potential to be an incredible value play going forward, but more importantly, it's looking like a short term play given its shares floating and its short float. Buy calls, buy shares, just buy it. Obligatory - 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀        **The Company**   Xl Fleet was founded in 2009 by an MIT grad by the name of Tod Hynes under the name XL Hybrids, the name denoting the core focus of the company in its infancy - hybrids, baby. They actually upgrade your gas powered vehicle to one of two hybrid configurations. They aren't as sexy as EV's with their cutting edge marketing and cool, you're in the future vibes, but they save money that companies would spend on fuel and they cut CO2 emissions. They do this through three existing services:   	* XL Hybrid - 25% MPG improvement, 20% CO^2 reduction 	* XL Plug In - up to 50% MPG improvement, 33% CO^2 reduction   	* XL Link - basically just software to monitor your upgraded hybrid fleet to save more money and stuff These are the three systems that they have installed so far, but they have two others they are racing to deploy:   	* XL Electric - Full on BEV's, none of that hybrid shit, not available yet but companies that are happy with XL Fleet will start buying these guys down the road.   	* XL Grid - Handles the charging and storage for your fleet of environmentally friendly vehicles      The XL Hybrid one is pretty straightforward. They use regenerative braking to provide electricity the car can use when accelerating afterwards. Over time this saves fuel. The Plug in option is a lot more EV style. Basically, they have a bigger battery that they charge up at a station, and that handles the power needs for the vehicle until it can't, at which point the regular engine kicks in.   Their goal is pretty straightforward - to provide simple, sustainable fleet electrification solutions to the commercial fleet market. This term ""electrification"" comes up a lot with them, it's just their half step towards fully electric vehicles that might be too expensive at present. Just how big is this market? XL Fleet's investor presentation cites their total addressable market as being over 1 Trillion. Now I can't count that high but my understanding is that it's quite a large number.       **The Leadership** Tod Hynes - Founder and President - literally teaches a class called Energy Ventures at MIT in his spare time.   Dimitri Kazarinoff - CEO - scaled hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x in two years. This matters a smidge because of that 1 trillion number and the fact that, while XL fleet is leading the electrification market,there is enormous potential for growth.   Colleen Calhoun - just brought her in a month or two ago - former VP and General Manager of the  XL Grid Division at General Electric and worked with them on Global Growth Markets.   Deb Frodl - Previously served as Global Executive Director for Ecomagination at General Electric. I don't even know what that word means but it sounds smart as fuck.   Niharika Ramdev - worked in supply chain finance for General Motors.   Sara Sclarsic - made a biotech company on her own, works with climate change stuff, and is pretty hot.      **Why XL Fleet?**   Transporation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US and fleet managers are under increased pressure to curb emissions. Some of you may have noticed the United States had an election recently, and the new guy wants us to save the planet and have non binary drum circles. Now you can feel how you want about that, but the bottom line is that if we don't have a biosphere conducive to the existence of the human species, then civilization collapses, and that means there is no more stock market. Pretty lame.      If you really don't give a shit about climate stuff, then just focus on the fact that XL Fleet saves companies money. One Coca Cola fleet manager said, ""There are fuel savings and potential maintenance savings. The XLH powertrain unit pays for itself three times over its lifespan due to these savings."" Well that's notable. That's the little guy, too. Just the XL Hybrid, not even the plug in version. XL Fleet is working with tons of big names like Coke, Pepsi, FedEx,Harvard?, Seattle firefighters, etc. They specialize in Class 2-6 commercial vehicles but are expanding into the large class 7 and 8 ones. That means they electrify utility vans, pickup trucks, box trucks, school buses, mini buses, delivery vehicles, step vans, bucket trucks and are going to eventually upgrade transit buses, tow trucks, refuse trucks, and semi tractors. Now I only know what about a quarter of those are without pictures, but you get what I'm saying. If it's a boring, task oriented vehicle you see a hundred times a month, then its probably something XL Fleet is trying to ""electrify.""      If the government makes a hard pivot to BEVs then XL Fleet may miss that market, but the big companies will still want to use them. Coke, Pepsi, and others have millions of vehicles. And no EV overhaul can happen overnight. By the time its in full swing, XL Electric will be up and running, bringing on new customers and converting existing customers.      One last thing, they already have deals with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Ford, Chevrolet, and Isuzu to make it easy to install their productst. I believe the financial types call that a moat. I'm a bit of a simpleton and just consider it another reason this rocket ship is heading for the heliopause.     **Slightly Financial Stuff**   XL already sells stuff. Oh yeah, you read that right. In this speculative EV landscape where people throw money at you for talking about skateboards and shit, XL has customers and real life products. Don't get me wrong, I think Canoo and Arrival sound cool, but they aren't going to be pumping out millions of vehicles any time soon. XL has plans to scale up exponentially by 2024.      Estimated revenue in 2021 is 75 million with 17 million in profits. Fast forward to 2024 and estimated revenue is 1.3 billion with 340 million in profit. Those estimates are on 6% North American Market penetration. That's ignoring their efforts at expanding overseas and their potential to outdo that 6% estimate.       Let's look at valuation, specifically estimated Enterprise value/revenue for 2023. Their investor presentation states their EV/Rev will be 1.5. For comparison, Tesla will be 6.4 and Workhorse will be 5.5. The numbers for 2024 look even better. Now I would have made a chart or attached a link but I'm tired and don't want to figure that shit out.      The bottom line is they have a product, a plan, and a good foothold in a massive addressable market.      **....Oh yea, the motherfucking short squeeze**   Almost forgot. So XL has a float of about 8 million shares. 71% of those are shorted. 8 million is a comically low number. Now, their shares outstanding is about 140 million or so, but those are locked up till roughly mid summer. If I've misunderstood that please correct me, but it looks like we've got some time to throw money at it, so do your GME thing and put some profits in XL Fleet.     Positions: 735 shares at 20.46. Cramer said don't buy it in the 20's and I say fuck Cramer. Also I don't know enough about the specifics of option pricing to really tell you if there are good deals to be had there, but the latest dated ones are August so I dunno.      If you've made it this far, I question how you spend your time.      Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, I have no clue what I'm talking about, I JUST LIKE THE STOCK!"|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4607994|public|confidence|self|A Look at XL Fleet|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ypdq/a_look_at_xl_fleet/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-01-28|FORD

Blackberry, Ford, Nokia, GME. What do these stocks all have in common? They all started off 2020 with low volatility or decreasing stock price, suddenly they swing up. If you invested $1000 into January 2022 call options for GameStop at its lowest point in 2020 ($5/share), you could have somewhere around $400,000-500,000 right now ($250/share)  How does this work? Well options have premiums based on the implied volatility of the stock itself (stocks that moves sideways have much lower options premiums than a high volatility stock). You can take advantage of this by buying long term expiry options (LEAPs) at relatively lost low cost with respect to the stock price. In a nutshell, find stocks that have been trading sideways for ages but more recently have gained huge growth potential.  # Example, please skip this if you’re a super autist  Let’s say Nokia is at trading at $4/share, it’s been priced on average at $4/share for the past 2 years. Its implied volatility is very low, so short volatility sellers (people who write the call/put contracts) are more willing to sell contracts at cheaper prices.  In this case a call option with a strike price of $5 for January 2022 trades at $0.3/share or $30 per contract.  The contract seller is assuming that Nokia won’t break past the strike price + premium ($5+$0.3 =$5.3) by January 2022.  This options contract is SUPER cheap, just compare the ratio of (share price)/(option premium) = 4/0.3 \~= 12. Right now GME is trading at $77/share and a $110 January 2022 call option is $35/share. Thus, GME’s (share price)/(option premium) ratio $77/$35 = 2.2. That’s a vast difference in the cost of the option with respect to the stock price between GME and Nokia.  However after just a $0.6 increase in Nokia’s stock on January 25th, 2021 ($4.2/share-&gt; $4.8/share), $5 January 2022 Nokia calls rose from ($0.3/share -&gt; $1.2/share) = 300% return.  The ratio of (share price)/(option premium) = 4.8/1.2 \~= 4. Which indicates that Nokia leaps are suddenly priced wayyy higher due to an increase in implied volatility of the stock.  If Nokia let’s say goes from $4/share to $20/share by 2022, the VALUE of the options contract COULD go from let’s say $0.3/share/contract to let’s say $15/share/contract depending on the Vega of the stock. That would be a 5000% return ($15/$0.3 = 50x) of your capital.  # How is this “Lower Risk”?  \- Worst case scenario:  you buy yearly call options and the stock continues to move in the opposite way than the one you predicted and/or stays stagnant. So what? You can sell the call option if you feel that your judgement was wrong and gain back a significant portion of your premium, as opposed to weekly options where if you miss the mark, game over.  \- Best case scenario: non linear returns (1% - infinity%) . If your low volatility stock suddenly rockets up over the year or two, well then you’ve earned more tickets to tendie town.  \- If you wanna play with high volatility stocks, might as well buy shares as the risk to reward ratio simply isn’t worth it.  # Summary of What to Look For  1. Look for companies with low implied volatility but ridiculously high growth potential (think Nokia, Blackberry, Ford)  2. H Y P E Potential.  GameStop, Nio, Palantir. All these stocks were shunned at first but when they gained hype, they touch the moon. If you bought calls for these companies when they were trading cheap, you'd be a rich MF.  3. Stocks with high liquidity. Don’t employ this strategy on low market cap stocks (less than $1billion imo), great way to be a bag holder most of the time. If you're bullish on these sorts of stocks, load up shares instead  4. Keep track at the average volume of trading with respect to shares outstanding, the more active a company is traded, the more likely it is to rocket. By keeping track of the velocity of shares being traded, you can somewhat predict whether a stock is likely to rocket because more people want to get in.  5. Solid fundamentals (low debt, profitable, high book value)  6. Pro Tip: DON’T BE A RETARDED SHORT VOLATILITY SELLER (writing call/put options) UNLESS YOU CAN HEDGE YOUR POSITION WITH SHARES. These strategies have liner gains (option premiums) but potential non-linear losses (stock suddenly plummets or moons in opposite direction of the option, i.e GME Short Squeeze).  TLDR; Don’t be a full retard, invest in CHEAP long term options (leaps) on companies with historical low implied volatility but huge growth potential. Stocks to look out for $NOK, $LUMN, $ERIC, .

More strategery here as shareholders were asked to whip out their 💎🍆 and slap the other side of the negotiating table's bidders/buyers in the face with them, by approving a 60m share authorization. MVIS can now survive until 2022 while they finish their LiDAR sensor due in April 2021.  https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iss-and-glass-lewis-recommend-approval-microvision-proxy  https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-third-quarter-2020-results  “MicroVision is focused on pursuing a strategic transaction at the right value for our shareholders.

We can expect some solid guidance and more hype.   &amp;#x200B;  Finally, with earnings, there isnt really too much to lose playing options.

For those autists out there that are too dumb to click the links, here is the TDDR for you –  Apple is going to market a car in 2024.  QNX makes car software work in EV.  Apple is rumored to be expanding its office in Canada, their current office is right fucking next door to Blackberry/QNX.  Apple has already siphoned of some of the QNX staff, but not all, and not the source code.  Apple needs QNX software for their EV.  Blackberry has 38,000 patents, with 10,000 of those with the word ‘vehicle’ in the patent.  Apple can use these patents. Apple needs these patents to get into a new car market. They are going to get their ass sued off when they start selling cars.  Tesla could also use these patents. Uber, Ford, GM, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, could use these patents. And the QNX software and software team.  Apple is (my guess only) making a bid for Blackberry to scoop up the rest of the QNX team, the source code and the patents. Tesla may be making a counterbid. Other players might be involved. Elon uses the QNX code already in his spacecars.  I don’t know anything factual, because I am a retard, this is only my guess based on the link, the reddit post above and logic. My autism has really progressed well since I am no longer a 🌈🐻.  The only logical autistic, retarded conclusion is that Blackberry stock is going to be worth $25B within the month. I am gambling my net worth on absolutely nothing but an anonymous reddit post.

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook &amp; Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM &amp; Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% &amp; the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.  About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%  For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.  Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies &amp; Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.  Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil &amp; Gas companies were the biggest losers  We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points  This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft &amp; Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&amp;T &amp; Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday &amp; Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla &amp; Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.  In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday &amp; Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low &amp; the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.  In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.  We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV &amp; self-driving sector.  Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB &amp; the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.  So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons &amp; especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely &amp; have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.  So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%  **Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!

So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% &amp; the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.  About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%  For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.  Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies &amp; Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.  Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil &amp; Gas companies were the biggest losers  We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points  This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft &amp; Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&amp;T &amp; Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday &amp; Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla &amp; Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.  In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday &amp; Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low &amp; the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.  In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.  We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV &amp; self-driving sector.  Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB &amp; the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.  So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons &amp; especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely &amp; have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.  So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%  **Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!

The report estimates the potential revenues when the cars are connected online. They said that the overall revenue pool from car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 - 750 billion by 2030.  Here is a breakdown of the possible revenue streams as per the report:  In-Car Sources of income (QNX Income):  1. OEMs selling the service to customers and advertisers paying for the data are among the business models that might contribute to the value of the data-enabled social driving experience, which is expected to have an estimated value of USD 7 - 8 billion by 2030. 2. High-tech giants are positioned to provide the fundamental car data analytics services that car OEMs and advertisers are willing to buy. In addition to being the IT backbone, they can offer front-end applications. 3. Start-ups are the smaller counterparts of the high-tech giants, entering the car data monetization space from a variety of angles, such as developing new apps, engineering innovative hardware/interfaces (e.g., retro-fittable gesture-activated controls) 4. Retailers and service centers are using car data analytics to optimize their sales network and get the messages about their offerings directly to drivers 5. Automotive OEMs. In addition to selling connectivity-related options and services (e.g., infotainment, navigation), OEMs are already becoming active in-car data analytics to better understand how customers use their cars, shape their repair and maintenance choices, and improve the link between dealers and customers (e.g., allowing for real-time, remote booking of vehicle check-ups). 6. Insurers are able to capitalize on car data by offering usage-based insurance contracts, exploring occasion-related policies  Big data and Cloud Sources of Income (IVY Income):  1. Service providers offer data management services 2. Regulators/government institutions are setting the standards regarding the collection and sharing of car data. 3. Automotive suppliers are developing the software and hardware that are forming the infrastructure capable of capturing, analyzing, and selling car data 4. Roadside assistance providers can collect and process distress calls in real-time from vehicle sensors and automated alerts 5. Infrastructure operators, including billing/toll road operators and recharging/refueling players, are analyzing car data to optimize the geographic deployment of their respective services  Customer willingness to pay for features – as opposed to a preference for free, ad-supported features – varies across use cases and geographies. To make it easier for us to have an early estimate of QNX potential revenues, we need to know their market share geographically too.  Germany (As per 2020 Sales):  QNX Clients: VW + Mercedes + BMW + Audi + Ford + Toyota + Kia= more than 62% of the Auto Market  China (As per 2019 Car sales):  QNX Clients: VW+ Honda + Hyundai + Mercedes + BMW +Kia= 42.7%  USA:  QNX Clients: More than 70%  \*\*New EV Clients of QNX are not included and not projected in any figures  \*\*GM and Porsche signed deals with Android Auto and Apple to be the operating systems of the car despite these cars running with QNX system.

In any event when our EIA was green lit in 2020 in February, the pandemic hit. And stalled and gave a massive pause to the entire mining industry. We now move fastforward to today.

Ford and for some time now, Volkswagon. All major worldwide car manufacturers are pivoting towards the EV paradigm shift. Tesla only makes about 500,000 cars per year, barely.

People in wall street are going crazy because these two stocks are years behind in EV's, the Microsoft deal is somewhat good news but using AI for cars takes experience and lots of data. I'm big on EV stocks and growth stocks, it doesn't take that much to impress me as long as there's potential and see proof.  GM and Ford are making EVs that have expensive old inefficient batteries and no software to make the motors independent to make them more efficient, they have no charging infrastructure and terrible milage. I'm more likely to put my money in $GOEV, $NIO, and Lucid motors when they're public. Startups have to innovate to stay alive, big carmakers have to put out a joke car so their investors think they will do something. Tesla has shown their innovators even while having the largest market cap and only delivering 500k cars a year. Telsa has the leg up in every sector but manufacturing power, which will change very soon. They have better software, better Machine learning, they have more EVs on the road giving their AI more data which makes it way better, their car efficiency is much better and they know how to make an EV  (now). They have better design and engineering, Ford and GM have a few cars combined Tesla has 4 out right now and 3 more on the way.  Ford and Gm even show that they are dependent on startups, remember GM and $NKLA instead of developing their own cars because they're too lazy they try buying a truck company that was public for a few months and no real working trucks.  Rivian and Ford not much more to say. Rivian is good but under funding from a joke car company, they will buy Rivian cut corners to make an easy cheap car. Ford and Gm arent innovators, you want a big car company that is somewhat serious good luck their plan is to buy a start-up.  Everyone wants TSLA to go to them, china loves tesla and they usually hate American companies that should prove how much countries want EV makers. The whole point is GM and F are jokes they got so used to making the same car and not needing anything they forgot how to innovate and bring change. VW their liars they can't even make a good ICE car how do you expect them to make a clean energy car without making an ICE emission problem almost no other carmakers have. You may see I'm a hardcore Tesla bull. You want 3 real cars $NIO and $TSLA and Lucid motors. You don't like Evs then GME and PLTR.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1948489|public|confidence|self|$GM &amp; $F are jokes.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2u2mf/gm_f_are_jokes/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-01-22|FORD

In any event when our EIA was green lit in 2020 in February, the pandemic hit. And stalled and gave a massive pause to the entire mining industry. We now move fastforward to today. With a Green Energy Proponent sitting in the most powerful executive office seat of any nation, Biden, committing to the Clean Energy Race along with China, any Lithium and clean energy play will do very well. Even Hydrogen power depends on Lithium to store the electricity. See Mirai from Toyota.

Ford and for some time now, Volkswagon. All major worldwide car manufacturers are pivoting towards the EV paradigm shift. Tesla only makes about 500,000 cars per year, barely. Ford in 2019 built and sold 5.4 million. And Ford is backing Rivian. And all legacy brands like the Mustang and the F150 are all going EV. Not to mention China and other clean energy movements.

I started in 2017 with like 30k of my own money and over the course of 3 years, spent probably a couple hundred hours learning about stocks, options, doing ""research"" etc. Today, I am down 8k since i started in 2017. That was money I planned on using for a downpayment on a house, and for paying my taxes on gains from last year. So once February comes around, the 20k I have left is basically going to taxes on gains from last year which are now gone. I am effectively broke :-) Im not that upset because I have a decent paying job.. but god damn, I was literally just contacting real estate agents last week because I was planning on buying a house. I could still buy one, but it will probably take me years to get back to 100k in savings. I should have just stuck to selling puts like I was doing for the past couple months. The gains aren't huge, but selling 100k worth of puts every week is enough to make you a couple G's every month with not a ton of risk. I could have made my future mortgage payments just selling puts. I am trying to look on the bright side. Having 100k made me spend somewhat frivolously. Like eating out twice a day, buying clothes i didn't need, etc. Now I have to go back to scrimping and scraping, which is good I think. I was getting a little ridiculous. Also, I have been finishing up my degree online but have had no motivation since I already have a decent job and decent money saved. Im feeling the pressure now to hurry up and finish my degree so I can get a better job (100k+ a year). I went all in on $390 1/22 SPY calls yesterday. I did the math; if we would have had a 1.5% day today, I would have made about 500k.. but it was pretty flat so at open, I was already down a shit ton. Figuring there was no chance left, I pulled out what was left, about 47k. I saw ford was going up crazy and figured that was pretty much my only chance to get back to where I was. Basically bought calls expiring tomorrow at the top, started going down, I pushed out and sold. So now I have 20k. I'm not super depressed about it or anything because I know ill be fine, but I already miss the coziness of having 100k stored away. Knowing that if I lost my job or something, id be okay. But like I said, Im looking on the bright side. My goal at the moment is to just save as much money as possible, pay my taxes in February, and then start over. Not even gonna lie, if I didn't need the 20k to pay taxes on last years gains, Id probably yolo it into something crazy. It's better to feel like this than nothing at all.

We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers are saying it’s overvalued, or in a bubble (which, could be true).  However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the bandwagon.   Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford’s market cap is literally half of NIO’s (who has 7,000 employees).  I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional car companies have in comparison to these startups gives them a HUGE advantage.  But now that these guys are finally making their own EV’s, investors rate starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well.  I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but never that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an “energy company” and blah blah blah.

However i would have not been able, just by myself, to track all those juicy tendies.  But....  But it seems to me that we're always all waiting for the BIG GAIN. We are looking for a total win or nothing. +200% is considered a decent gain, nothing more.   Is that right?  For example... i was up to 262% with my APHA calls few days ago. I didn't even think about selling....and now, after few days, i'm again down to a +26%...  Had the same experience with PLUG and now BB...  Is it worth to always aim to a 1000% with the risk of never reaching it?  Wouldn't it be smarter to collect a steady +30% on a weekly basis, jumping from a meme stock to another one (for ex: BB last week, collect the gains, then jump on Ford this week, collect the gains and move to another one)   instead of always aiming at the moon?

My last post suggested January and February $10.50 and $11c. February and beyond are printing.       I cant help but think there is zero chance Ford doesn't drastically change. The F-150 EV when available will crush all of these other new EV companies with trucks that think they are going to make it big. I have to believe they will have more EV cars outside of the F-150 and MachE.     They have a lot of under utilized manufacturing capabilities and should be reaching out to companies to manufacture cars for them. Like Tesla. Who blows at making actual cars.

For those autists out there that are too dumb to click the links, here is the TDDR for you –   Apple is going to market a car in 2024. QNX makes car software work in EV. Apple is rumored to be expanding its office in Canada, their current office is right fucking next door to Blackberry/QNX. Apple has already siphoned of *some* of the QNX staff, but not all, and not the source code.  Apple needs QNX software for their EV. Blackberry has 38,000 patents, with 10,000 of those with the word ‘vehicle’ in the patent. Apple can use these patents.  Apple needs these patents to get into a new car market.  They are going to get their ass sued off when they start selling cars. Tesla could also use these patents.  Uber, Ford, GM, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, could use these patents. And the QNX software and software team.   Apple is (my guess only) making a bid for Blackberry to scoop up the rest of the QNX team, the source code and the patents.  Tesla may be making a counterbid.  Other players might be involved.  Elon uses the QNX code already in his spacecars.  I don’t know anything factual, because I am a retard, this is only my guess based on the link, the reddit post above and logic.  My autism has really progressed well since I am no longer a 🌈🐻.   The only logical autistic, retarded conclusion is that Blackberry stock is going to be worth $25B within the month. I am gambling my net worth on absolutely nothing but an anonymous reddit post.

Currently No-Positions in any automotive stonks (or much of anything other than fighting for GME at the moment)  Background: No financial background. I’m just a failing engineering student who washes dishes to gamble his way out of debt.  Rockets for the autists 🚀 🚀 🚀    Please give me feedback (good or bad)  **1.** **Ford and GM are not Tesla, but they can be damn close**  They do not have a space division or Tunneling company to influence their stock price. They are more focused on the automotive industry. This can be good to be zeroed on making good vehicles, but all of the chips are in on their vehicles performing to expectations. A slip up like the Tesla fire can be a real threat to our short-term gains. Additionally, their CEO’s (Jim Farley and Mary Barra) don’t meme their stocks so don’t expect blessings from the lord.   On the other hand: A ton of R&amp;D and public rallying behind EV has already been done for them by Musk and smaller EV brands, they just have to perform well to compete. We know how much Elon wants to standardize his charging plugs for his cars and any upcoming compatibility news between brands is a 🚀  **2.** **Current supply shortages**  I’ve seen the news that Subaru had to cut its production back due to the global shortage of semiconductors. It is important to remember that not just the auto industry is going green. Look at the price of lithium stocks recently and rare earth stocks. Other industries like green energy farms (Solar, Wind, Tidal) are also popping up and need these resources.  As we are starting to break away from Covid-19 hurting business, and people start to get back to work and buy things like cars. (Ford and GM were up on quarterly earnings through Covid regardless) a greater demand for cars, more specifically EV vehicles may drive demand past supply of said vehicles. This in turns leaves a shortage and Car/EV prices to increase. How can people buy new cars if there are no new cars to buy?  On the other hand: As the shortage of supply becomes more and more apparent in the market. There will be a balancing force to restabilize. I see this as increased efforts at recycling metals, and plastics as well as new mining operations for precious metals. This is very much in line with the going green policy and some of it now even now begins to take place. Lucky for us lithium is a pretty abundant resource also so I am not worried about battery shortages. Check newest $PLL and $LAC mining agreements.   **3.** **Industry and the market adapting in the coming years**  I know a lot of you retards aren’t in this for the long haul but this may affect you if you are in it long enough to see these cars come to fruition. This kind of goes with the last one in regards to keeping price down so people can buy. As manufactures begin to struggle to source a supply of materials, a shift in design is going to have to occur to maintain sales. I see this shift as being new smaller/lighter vehicles focused on efficiency as a majority of production but EV SUV’s and Pickups definitely still being on the menu based on the success and sentiment of Tesla’s larger vehicles and other SUVs/Pickups in general.   On the other hand: Companies like Ford and GM don’t have to rush into an all EV lineup, they’ve been making gasoline vehicles and can/will continue to do so as the market continues to shift to EV. This still gives them a source of revenue and should keep the earnings reports positive even as supplies for EV development are scarce.    **If I were to go in what would I do?**  One of these options.  1. I run as far away from these as possible.  2. Go for the low commit play. I would buy into the hype early. I’m broke right now because of GME yolo but I could get in like 50-60 shares unstressed. We may see a discount on 1/21 with the Tesla fire to go in on Ford for the Rivian Potential. Hold till any more news hits then scram (not pussy paper hand news like “OMG Ford is a dead brand will be back to $8 easy” I’m here for gainz).  3. Buy some calls. I’m not really fluent in options so pardon my retardation but this could be a learning experience given the potential once I do some catching up and get some more gains than just buying shares. If you do not know anything about options do not trade options. Then again this is r/wallstreetbets and I’m not your wife’s bf.  4. Actual smart investment. I’m kind of in this with GME and looking past the meme and hype train and see some actual potential for these stocks and for GM and Ford to get their shit together. Jim Farley seems promising for Ford to make a difference and anyone with half a brain cell wants to get a piece of Tesla’s EV pie. I really believe that Ford has an opportunity to transform itself from a company that makes metal dogshit into something to compete with Tesla and at the very least be worth more than $15 a share.

He currently drives a 2008 Ford Five Hundred with 280K miles on it. For comparison, I drive a Model 3 and don't make as much as him.  He agreed to the following: I instruct him how to invest $10K and if I can grow it to $45K, he'll buy the Model Y.  Position thesis:  $STPK (Stem Inc): They are incredibly undervalued at $1.3B. Tesla's valuation is significantly dependent on them ""not being a car company."" This points to their energy storage business which most analysts have projected would account for half of their revenue in the future. Energy storage is a $1.2T industry and Stem is the current market leader (ahead of Tesla!). Their Athena software controls how that energy is used based on demand charges/variable electric rate/renewable generation/ect. This SaaS allows the owner to improve their ROI. Citron price target of $100 puts their market cap at around $15B which is incredibly conservative. Considering their 348% growth target this year BEFORE Biden's clean energy plans-this stock is set to explode.  $GOEV (Canoo): There was just a fair market analysis done that suggests their business is worth over $26/share. That's before any Lyft or Apple agreements which we should learn about by March. There seems to be a lot of discussion/confusion around Hyundai's E-GMP skateboard design. The E-GMP platform has been co-developed with Canoo using their IP. Canoo should get mentioned when Hyundai/Kia begin announcing their new EVs built on this new modular skateboard EV platform. A Apple/Hyundai agreement on an EV would certainly benefit Canoo. They were seeking an investment in early 2020 from Apple and instead, Apple wanted to discuss an acquisition. Canoo turned them down and went public instead which shows their tech is legit.

In addition, the market is being pushed by the new equipment needed for 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), both of which continue to expand.

Smart move my fellow degens 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.  TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX is fun too.  Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.  You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.  So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*  **Zombie cars and QNX**  QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.  Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally could develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.  Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*  You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.  That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.  You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.  The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.  Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  **Blackberry x AWS IVY**  IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership.

Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.  IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.  But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.  Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.  For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1890481|public|confidence|self|The Full DD on $BB: An Elon Musk+Jeff Bezos sandwich for our Supreme Leader John Chen|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '2zmJvztiSV37EsOkJY_rGbUZkIKSk8DoELJ8tM3a6ag', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8s5JfSipEY2L9fgv5joMLzgEEvzOqs7UJFbjW7igC-M.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc88626514d90166f68ac1764544d480a427421', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8s5JfSipEY2L9fgv5joMLzgEEvzOqs7UJFbjW7igC-M.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7350dc77a504e8b2b12d58976d8a1d5a28b49dbc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8s5JfSipEY2L9fgv5joMLzgEEvzOqs7UJFbjW7igC-M.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5f1a46be046fcaae65e8dfecd10d68d94aae2a6', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 293, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8s5JfSipEY2L9fgv5joMLzgEEvzOqs7UJFbjW7igC-M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=829f474d08f49969f2ace9955ce1c61198c1068f', 'width': 520}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-01-19|FORD

Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.  TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.  **Software**  BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and QNX is apple car play compatible already.     **Fundamentals**  BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)  [https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.     Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and Tutes sold alot.

Recently, I decided why not both?  A little background: GM has some short term catalysts in 2021 as a recovery play. It sold the most trucks in the US in 2020 and apparently isn’t yet affected by a semiconductor shortage that is forcing Ford to idle some plants, but the real story here is Cruise.  GM owns Cruise, the SF-based autonomous vehicle technology company, that plans to offer autonomous taxi and delivery services. The total addressable market is $5-8 trillion according to the Cruise CEO.   “Dan Ammann, CEO of the GM majority-owned autonomous vehicle subsidiary, on Wednesday said that valuation includes autonomous ride-hailing services to compete against current companies such as Uber and Lyft at a potentially $5 trillion sector; $2 trillion for freight; and $500 billion each for data insights and in-vehicle experiences.” Source: [CNBC ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/gms-cruise-values-autonomous-vehicle-industry-at-8-trillion.html)   *Why now?*  1) Cruise had once aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called ‘driverless’ vehicles by the end of 2019 (so they must have thought they were pretty close). Cruise started fully autonomous taxi service in SF in December 2020  2) In January, Cruise hired the former COO of Delta, another pretty strong signal they are getting ready for commercialization.  3) In a recent earnings call, GM CEO indicated they were open to a sale of Cruise which was last valued at $19bn. In this market, if they show any sign of progress, should be $100bn (vs current market cap of GM of $71bn). If GM retains minority control, it’s all upside. [Deutsche Bank analyst who asked the question on earnings call explains](https://youtu.be/12XMATuP3_0)  4) GM crushed it at CES, unveiling a flying drone and new business called BrightDrop, “ecosystem of electric products, software and services to help delivery companies transport goods more efficiently”  *Price Target* 🎯 🌝   In December, Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas raised its price target to $57, USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 30% to account for execution risk. That’s insanely conservative in my opinion, but hey let’s go with it for a second. Back of the napkin, if the present value is $57/share and the discount rate is 30%, that implies a future value of $420.69 in 7.6186 years. This market has been making moves in dog years and Jonas’s call was made in Dec, so that means we celebrating New Years 2022 in tendie town.  But seriously, I think we are going to $100 this year which Jonas also cited as a “blue sky” bull case. Under that scenario, Cruise is spun off at $100bn valuation.  I’m just sharing my call, not giving advice.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors.[7] It also has joint-ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and Russia (Ford Sollers).  Ford was recently recommended by Cramer as a [buy](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stock-market-today-with-jim-cramer-ford-amazon-deutsche-bank-trump). After he did so, I began my DD.  **The Current State of Ford**  Ford has done what many other automakers have done - they have shifted to unibody platforms allowing production to swap based on demand. We all know the F series is Ford's bread and butter - they have been able to capture a large portion of the light-truck market. That isn't what has me excited - they've been able to do that for years.   It's no secret that Ford was behind the ball on hitting new technologies. Their previous CEO, Jim Hackett, was slow to adapt and shares fell 40% under him.  They have a new CEO who has been restructuring operations and shifting the focus away from milking the F-Series market and focusing on autonomous vehicles, EV and higher profit margins.   There are two factors that I think provides Ford a big opportunity to grow in the short and long-term.  * Factor 1 - Ford is severely undervalued in the market. Ford is the fifth largest auto maker and has had a small rally of 26.78% over the last three months. That still puts them well below their five-year high (-$23.44% over the last 5 years) with only a current market cap of 38.909B. GM by comparison, has made a 53.65% run in the last 3 months and has a market cap of 69.748B. Tesla, has a market cap of 809.90B. Ford has a lower market cap than many much smaller auto makers - it has room to roll.  **Factor 2 - EV Fleet vehicles. Ford has already dipped their toes into the EV market with the Mach E. I don't believe Ford electrifying their F-Series trucks is a large future just based on the lack of overlap between EV demographics and the F150 demographic. What I do believe is the future is using the E-450 platform for commercial uses, like electric shuttle busses and more. There are other companies whos business model is to [use the E-450 platform to do so](https://www.phoenixmotorcars.com/products/). Ford having the platform and now technology in place leads me to believe this is going to be an emerging commercial sector.   **My Positions**  tldr; Ford is undervalued and has a bright future under current leadership, which is focusing on emerging technologies.   Here are my current positions:  1. Stocks; 2. The Leap - 1/21/22 $12 C; 3. The Yolo - 1/15/21 $10 C.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1830582|public|confidence|self|Ford [$F]- the Jim Cramer recommended Boomer Stock that will go boom 🚀🚀🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx6irw/ford_f_the_jim_cramer_recommended_boomer_stock/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'beckf357abBnptOaT8yh3Lqebs5s8Rti49plY0ml8IM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b8b6d75f4b89f6427f76f54c04e7f97589d561', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aec76fbe1195e3078403caf51420e6acbf74b06', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d1e668153a93f39c15f2064139d88b4769cc6d6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4a1f334d05ecb0abe9f4fb9e3715a4c2bc8e269', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c358622b3c8f79435e9aa348331aec2f24ea02', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1228aed188d4c013d5cd4c6295b0a5484bce1a31', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 675, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f64ac9c1c29e39d50ab6fdb40d621c851f8ee7d4', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-01-14|FORD

Ford is the opportunity to print more.   They've been around for a while, and they suffered a huge dip over the last year because of the lack of new vehicle purchases, however the pandemic seems to be coming to an end soon, and it looks like Ford is going to make moves. They've been working on EVs for a while now, and released their first EV which is the Mustang Mach-E, an SUV, a Fucking family car, this is too good. This SUV was also named SUV of the year, which says something about Ford's ability to make a reliable EV.  [https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-named-best-suv-2020-2021-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-named-best-suv-2020-2021-1)  They also just closed 3 pretty large factories in Brazil, which seems like bad news, but this will Maximize their profits, create a better looking balance sheets, and contribute to the EV movement. These actions will result in $4.1 billion in pre-tax charges, $2.5 billion in employee separation, termination, and settlement payments, and another $1.6 billion in non-cash write-offs.    There is a lot of Speculation that Fords new EVs will compete with Tesla, and that could significantly affect Fords stock price. The F150 is the most popular truck in America, when an electric f150 launches and their successful marketing is able to get customers to switch over in large amounts, plus add new customers, their tendies will only get bigger. California already has laws in place to ban Gas cars by 2030, and other states will follow through soon. Ford is an established company making a move on the market.

WHY? HELLA TAILWINDS:  -FORD own’s 30% of Rivian a direct competitor to TSLA (Amazon owns ~30%)  -FORD is doing effective housecleaning and cost cutting, new CEO is there for business not family legacy bullshit. (Just canned South America)  -They cut the boomer ass dividend out of the stock  -FORD paid negative taxes of 600 million last year(rolls over to this year src: marketwatch)  -FORD revenues are 4x Tesla (F $155.9B vs TSLA $24.58B )at 1/20th the valuation(F $39b vs TSLA $796b)...   (if Tesla does ever drop, would expect people to invest in to stay in Auto)  -Under performed against peers (GM up 35% YOY while FORD only up 5%) OH AND THAT STOCK CALLED TSLA up 600%+ YOY  -The bronco is dope (just wait for the EV)  -OH AND THEY HAVENT RELEASED THE ELECTRIC F150 the most popular car in America.  Conservatively at GMs valuation this goes up 35% in the next 12 months. Brings it to at LEAST $15 bucks. Calls for $10 1/21/22 are only $1.64. (Math 15 - 11.64 = 3.36),   Conservatively you will double your money.   My money is spread on these and shorter term calls at the $10 strike. bargains for days.  Wouldn’t be surprised if we saw closer to a $25 price This time next year.

Welcome to Wednesday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-  *****  #[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)  # 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday  *****  &gt; # 1. Stocks set for modest drop &gt; * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week’s Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday’s trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.  &gt; * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target’s stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target’s same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.  *****  &gt; # 2. House to impeach Trump &gt; * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump’s first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.  &gt; * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it’s not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It’s unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump’s impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration next Wednesday.  *****  &gt; # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment &gt; * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, “I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.”  &gt; * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week’s siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won’t remove him from office.  *****  &gt; # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account &gt; * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump’s account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. “Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel,” said YouTube, owned by Alphabet’s Google unit. YouTube’s decision to freeze Trump’s account follows the indefinite suspension of the president’s Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.  *****  &gt; # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns &gt; * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.  &gt; * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday. Starting Jan. 26, arriving American citizens and foreign travelers will have to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight to the U.S.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mEF0gpr.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Dxl1GUr.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/huzAuO4.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/y7veYuf.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Dr7cIXH.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/6en33i4.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JOigL6t.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/6fWZUh0.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gKye6Nn.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QEgnSce.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/kJmoKVK.png)**)   *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/FomS5OQ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IJrn5lV.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PcuI59p.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-urban-outfitters-target-kb-home-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Urban Outfitters (URBN)** – Urban Outfitters shares are under pressure after the apparel retailer said comparable holiday season sales fell 9%, and also announced the departure of Trish Donnelly as CEO of the Urban Outfitters Group unit.

Lightning eMotors manufactures powertrains, complete vehicles, and charging solutions for the zero-emission medium-duty commercial market. The company was founded in 2008 and has a manufacturing facility in Loveland, Colorado. There are already 120 vehicles on-road, 1500 vehicles on order. 100% of 2021 and the majority of 2022 are already contracted. They hold a 50% market share in[ class 3 to class 6](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/tmg_2013/images/figurec-1.jpg) electric vehicles. The ticker symbol will change to $ZEV (cool ticker symbol) upon merging which is set tentatively for mid-February, 2021.  Product and Business  * All commercial vehicles are built in 2 stages - OEM → Upfitter (Upfitters are responsible for decking out the trucks based on customer’s requirements. An ambulance truck’s interiors are different from a telecom providers’ truck) → Customer. * ZEV is in the business of manufacturing complete vehicles (based on chassis from OEMs), electrifying the existing fleet (this is basically removing the combustion engine and making it fully electric), charging stations, fleet management software, and financing the purchase orders.  KeyPoints  * A lot of interest has been towards companies like Hyliion, Rivian , Canoo, Arrival. Yes, they look really nice and sleek. But it presents a huge problem for fleet operators - The vehicles have not been tested to be able to depend on them and there is virtually no service partners or services network in the US. If a rearview mirror breaks down, it might take a week or more to receive them. Any downtime is loss of revenue for fleet operators. As ZEV orders its chassis from OEMs like GM, Ford, Hino, Isuzu, and Navistar, they are able to receive spare parts in a matter of hours if not days. Also, the warranty from OEMs carries over as well. This is a huge advantage that ZEV will have over other companies entering this space. * Last-mile fleets run 8 classes of vehicles from multiple OEMs (no OEM offers everything). ZEV is the only supplier today that has class 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and Fuel cell trucks/vans. Ford, Rivian, and Arrival have announced Class 2 EVs only. ZEV operates in a niche segment where it does not make business sense for OEMs to channel investments into. The Class 3 and above commercial segment is characterized by low volumes and diverse operational requirements. * ZEV can build/assemble about 15 Class 3 and 4 powertrains and vehicles per week right now on a single 8-hour shift. The coaches take a lot longer as they are much more complicated and not yet as automated (but much higher price). This production capacity only equates to less than 4K class 3 and class 4 vehicles. They need serious cash to be able to expand their manufacturing capacity to build 25k vehicles by 2025. * More eyeballs on the[ Amazon vehicles in San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1KURWf74o&amp;feature=youtu.be) provided by ZEV. One should remember that Amazon will never be able to source their entire fleet from a sole operator including Rivian. The pie is big enough to be shared by several players in this space.  Risks  * Execution risk as they try to expand their manufacturing facility to 750,000 sq.ft which is only currently at 250,000 sq.ft. * GigCaptial3, the SPAC sponsor does not seem to be bringing anything valuable to the table. They seem to be really good at providing 'SPAC in a box' type service, which in this case is perfect for ZEV as they are basically looking for more cash infusion and do not have to worry about all financial and regulatory concerns in going public. * As more competitors enter the space in the next 2 to 3 years, it could be a little harder in differentiating.

They have a phenominal new CEO with some Lisa Su level turn around potential.  He is doing everything right.  Cutting garbage unprofitable brands, doing the hype videos and apple/tesla style car releases.  They're focused more on high quality, high margin hype cars than ""lets just produce a bunch of shit"".    They're aiming for a GLOBAL profit margin of 8%.  Sure, they plan on taking a revenue hit, but so far the profits have been growing exponentially and the revenue hasn't been hit very hard.    Remember, Ford consistently hits 140-150 BILLION in revenue a year.  Currently, they have a 1-2% or abour 3-4 billion in profit a year.  Even if they take a massive hit in revenue, like 25 billion, thats still a minimum of 10 billion dollars profit, and thats only if they don't exceed that.    They did something similar after the 2008 crash, and their stock price went 1.80$ a share to nearly 20$ a share.  Remember, just prior to this, they also took a hit from the dotcom bubble crash, when they hit 90$ a share.    Personally, I could easily see this stock hitting a minimum or 15$ by 2022 and 20-30$ by 2023. Getting some WSB momentum behind it could easily raise that number quite a bit.  If it picks up some steam, and their CEO keeps doing everything right, then we could easily see 20$ by 2022.    Also, no its not a boomer stock anymore.  They got rid of the dividend for now, which means bigger profits and stock gains, they're producing tons of EV cars, apple style hype car releases, and Lisa Su level CEO comeback story.

An agriculture manufacturer for those who don’t know, completely underrated stock, been buying and selling this since 130$.  Deere will be on display at CES 2021 and won an award for their X-Series combine. In the the most compulsory sector of the world: farming. Deere tractors are synonymous with quality in the US. Last September Ford’s Farley said he wants Ford to “Run like a Deere”. Farmers rely on their equipment for their livelihood, and the rest of us rely on them to farm shit and send it to us.  If you look at the chart for DE you’ll notice it’s always green. John Deere tractors are green. Coincidence? Doubt it.  Reuters Stock Reports Plus gives DE a 9/10 which on par with Apple and other good shit. One of ARK’s portfolios has been buying it recently (ARKQ?) and I’ve personally just doubled down and bought more. P/E is a relatively modest 33.8 and cash flow per share at 15.54, and a Reuters risk score of 10. Literally can’t go tits up.   Earnings was beaten every quarter last year and Morgan Stanley have them at Overweight with a price target of 341 doll hairs. It’s actually a profitable company producing slabs of cash so it’s not in the radar for these 800 year old analysts to attack instead of retiring. SPEAKING OF it’s could be seen as a bit of a boomer stock since it’s been around forever and gives a little dividend (3.04$ PA) which doesn’t hurt either. The IV is lower than Trump’s IQ so it’s pretty unlikely that’s it’s going to be subject to major swings, the thing barely even moves premarket.  With the move to autonomous vehicles we can expect that at some point the agriculture industry is going to follow suit, with numerous extensions available for their equipment, the Deere’s are pretty close to driving themselves and last year a fully autonomous tractor concept was unveiled. This will save farmers zillions of hours of work.

However, I still want to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.  **For y’all degenerates, just skip those next paragraphs and go straight to the picks. For y’all nerds who want to understand a thing or two about my program, keep on reading.**  * My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones. * I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.  **Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**  * The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model). * The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.  **Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.  **Enough said, here’s the (small) list!**  **Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**  Market Cap: $6.5bn  Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.  Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.  **Magna International (MGA) +436%**  Market Cap: $22.7bn  Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.  Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.  Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.  If y'all find these insights useful, please let me know and I’ll keep sharing them here on a weekly basis :)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1799040|public|confidence|self|I built a program that detects buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter|1.0|[]|0.89|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuo4zg/i_built_a_program_that_detects_buzzing_stocks_on/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2021-01-10|FORD

China is more advanced than the average American thinks, but it DOES NOT have the ability to convert to electric anytime soon. Their major cities are impressive, but travel outside of them or to rural parts and there's unstable infrastructure (particularly electric), China becomes third world.  This is important because electric cars will be nothing but a luxury item for rich people to buy in major cities, and not something the average person will want, or even be able to use effectively, if they live in the 90% of China which isn't a major city. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to build or maintain something like Tesla's impressive super charger network in China. Too much of it is rural  Whereas in America, it's possible. In Canada and western European countries? It's possible. I've owned a Tesla for 2 years in SoCal and taken a few long distance road trips on it... and the super charger network is fucking amazing. You can trust it, and you get the impression that America can convert to 100% electric within 20 years, whereas China could reach America's CURRENT level of usage in maybe 25 years. There are just too many hurdles for China to become majority electric anytime soon.  Tesla knows how to do it, they've taken over the entire American market for EV and there is no competitor in sight. Dinosaur companies like Ford and Honda operate on short term profits. If they can make more in the short term squeezing the last amount of profit out of the gasoline era, they will do it instead of losing profit to convert their existing infrastructure. Therefore Tesla will continue to dominate with no real challenger in sight for at least the next decade.  Tesla's real moon mission will be as it continues to absorb the entire EV market in the west as the west simultaneously passes sweeping legislation to force EV usages and ban gasoline vehicles... like what california (6th largest economy in the world) is doing by 2030. Elon will be like a fatass hippo with his mouth wide open, gobbling up EV market share that the western governments forcefully create. Perfect travel conditions for a decade long moon mission, I'd say.  Basically, no one wants to own a NIO. Even if it isn't just a cheap chinese knockoff, it feels like that. People want Tesla, governments are forcing pro EV laws whether people want them or not (yellow vest strikes in France), and there's nothing those yellow vest peasants can do about it except buy TSLA and not be peasants anymore by 2030.  China may gap up faster than I think, but the entire west will be 100% EV before China is even 30% EV, so Tesla is the way to go. I feel like it's MC is worth 4-5 trillion|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1794624|public|confidence|self|Why NIO can't compete with Tesla.

This is one of the keys. We have got a lot of IPO money going into EV’s companies that don’t have any manufacture capability. Here is when Magna is gonna enter the scene and go to the moon and beyond   They are present in 27 countries,+165.000 employees, 13.000 engineers and nearly 40B in sales.   Revenue is growing in the last 10 years, went from  28B to 40B   EBITDA is growing too, 2B to 4B   EV/Ebitda is 12x   Debt/Ebitda is less than 2x   CFO went from 1,2B to 3,9B in the past 10 years.   Steady Capex   Shares Outstanding, good job with buybacks, went from 471M to 306M   Free cash flow per share went form 0,15$ to almost 8$    The average free cash flow yield the last tean years is nearly 10%     They just signed an agreement last month with LG that made the stock rise 10%   And the most important thing, they’re the frontrunners to build the Apple EV car. If/When this happens and is official ... Can you imagine the jump we'll see??   As they say, buy with the rumors and sell with the news. But even without this, Magna is the frontrunner to be one of the most important companies of the next 10 years, since the car companies want to externalize as much as possible to continue competing.   When Apple and other EV companies begin to announce big big deals with MGA, it would be too late.

The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.  Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.  Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.  In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.  While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.  [TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.  In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.  So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.  We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.  We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.  And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them.  [Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.  On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.  My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.  So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**   Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.  Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.  Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.  Most small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.  The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.  We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).  [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.  If the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it’s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn’t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any “big tax changes” or any other “big regulation changes”. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn’t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.  In some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don’t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.  Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN’s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.  Meanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.  So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.

And, indeed, those guys put out an [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/why-moderna-stock-plunged-today/) wondering why MRNA took a dive about a week ago. No firm conclusions from them, other than the fact that Moderna isn't on their list of the top ten best stocks which might have been drawn up by a haruspex for all I know.  Anyways.  I'm serious when I say that I think Moderna is undervalued. And I don't have any financial interests in this post, either. Mostly I'm trying to psych myself up because, hey, maybe I'm not talking nonsense. Their stock price just looks absolutely bonkers.  Everyone who bought Moderna at its peak a month ago has been keeping up with the news. No doubt most of you have been watching red numbers in horror. (I'm sure there's at least one bear who's sitting nicely on some puts, but I don't know how many people put their money down on what would've been a very risky wager. It can't be zero.) Moderna got its emergency use authorization from the FDA awhile back; they're not the only company with a COVID vaccine, though, and the headlines for Moderna since then have been pretty bad (in comparison with, say, Pfizer). Many vaccines have side effects, but then you hear about the fact that [side effects with the Moderna vaccine are super common for people with dermal implants](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/moderna-vaccine-facial-filler), and every now and then you'll see an article about [some frontline worker getting hospitalized after their Moderna-powered vaccination](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/12/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-triggers-severe-allergic-reaction-in-wallowa-county-health-care-worker-officials-say.html) (there's more than one example, that's just the most recent). And the investors are panicking.  Investors, of course, are stupid sheep, because this stuff is nothing new. Remember back in 1976 when [an outbreak of the swine flu caused the Ford administration to push through a vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak), then some people who got the vaccine ended up with Guillain-Barré syndrome, ironically causing people to freak out even more? You know how many people actually suffered serious side effects? A few hundred. Out of literally millions -- about 25% of the US population, including President Ford himself, received the vaccine. What happened was basically the worst-case scenario and the chances of any single person getting their nervous system mangled was still infinitesimal. You'd literally have a better chance of being struck by lightning. (Lightning, for what it's worth, doesn't usually kill, either.)  Yeah, maybe people who have had cosmetic surgery recently should be careful with the Moderna vaccine. That's nothing. Most people will need to wait their turn anyways, as healthcare workers will largely continue to get the first doses. I don't know if the majority of Americans will have a chance at vaccination before the end of the coming year. For every scaremongering news article reporting on (relatively uncommon) side effects, you get a bunch of other articles about how, say, [Moderna's vaccine was just used to vaccinate a senior living facility](https://katv.com/news/local/moderna-vaccine-administered-at-little-rock-senior-living-facility). (I have no idea about the ratio -- can't be bothered to do the math -- but you should also keep in the mind the old adage of ""if it bleeds, it leads."") Hell, the biggest risk associated with Moderna's vaccine is probably wastage from negligence or malice, [like what happened with that pharmacist in Wisconsin](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/31/952536531/pharmacist-arrested-accused-of-destroying-more-than-500-moderna-vaccine-doses). Dude straight-up destroyed 550 doses. Big yikes, as the kids say.  I feel like if I don't watch myself I'll veer off into a tangent about vaccine safety in general and other fun topics that're suited for a good ramble. The main point is this: Moderna's still putting out vaccines. They finished Phase 3 trials very, very recently. The verdict? [It works](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-142200437.html). If you get COVID you could get seriously fucked up, as the poor souls in the placebo group cofirmed, and the people in the vaccine group all lived. Oh, yeah, and the Department of Defense is buying up doses under some cushy government contract. That probably means something.  Maybe it's just my gut that says a company which has put out a viable COVID vaccine shouldn't have its stock continue to tank indefinitely. The trend line of MRNA prices has been steadily [down since early December](https://i.imgur.com/xSLwIJM.png). In the last few days, though, I think I see the barest [hint of an inflection point](https://i.imgur.com/8tb2XQp.png). In the [past day, even](https://i.imgur.com/z2fIQT1.png).  Or maybe I'm seeing things and it'll continue to slide. If you think that I'm wrong, go ahead and take out a whole bunch of puts, see if you're not too late to pull in a profit. I don't care. I just hope fewer people will be dying from COVID from now on.  This post is flaired Discussion and not DD because nothing that comes out of my mouth is intelligent enough to be considered Due Diligence."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1759730|public|confidence|self|Is Moderna currently undervalued?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kot6ww/is_moderna_currently_undervalued/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'scoumnWV7NZXmeEVnmzKnrHyA26V31lqp1XVv_Ikqlk', 'resolutions': [{'height': 88, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2VT7Qy2fLHsez7kObNZLUNFufbkGRIcsOtHan-nAN6c.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d74179b78b8755b49502be963e5e18799b6f3806', 'width': 108}, {'height': 176, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2VT7Qy2fLHsez7kObNZLUNFufbkGRIcsOtHan-nAN6c.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0790ad1808b40a6d4b3392d74c5466f1d569dae2', 'width': 216}, {'height': 261, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2VT7Qy2fLHsez7kObNZLUNFufbkGRIcsOtHan-nAN6c.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39dc57becd362fda61fda79a2eecf8f1e027debb', 'width': 320}, {'height': 522, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2VT7Qy2fLHsez7kObNZLUNFufbkGRIcsOtHan-nAN6c.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e64692cf69344fa4a8ed4a363e530c2d73d67627', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 674, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2VT7Qy2fLHsez7kObNZLUNFufbkGRIcsOtHan-nAN6c.png?auto=webp&amp;s=6e08cc2040716aaac8dfed8e0e0700983d897365', 'width': 826}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-01-02|FORD

Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.  # The 2021 TSLA trade plan  ## What moves the stock?  Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.  &gt;Institutional investors aren't selling  TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!  So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.  &gt;Retail investors aren't selling  What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.  &gt;Insiders aren't selling  Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.  So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.  This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.  # The Plan and Headwinds  Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.  **In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**  With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.  If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.  **In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**  I wrote about stock market DD here: [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1757719|public|confidence|self|The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kobcex/the_tsla_2021_trade_plan/|some_ads|7.0|#b8001f|light||||||||efb6a476-24c5-11e9-b89a-0ecd4fdb4da4||||||2021-01-01|FORD

Yes, alot of people aren't a fan that its called a Mustang, but what it does have going for it is:  1.  Tesla is its only real competition right now, (Except for Nio as well in the chinese market) 2.  Its a few grand cheaper than a Tesla, but also less features.  (Which is good because it has a hefty profit margin)  3.  Has a nice EV credit to go with it.  (Ford can pull a tesla and sell EV credits as well) 4.  Has the Ford distribution chain, which is 10x larger than Tesla, with more reach. 5.  Ford will have 0 issues with production like Tesla tends to have 6.  It will be selling globally in 2021, so massive potential in China, especially since nobody in China knows what a ""Mustang"" car is and its significance so it won't have the same branding issues like it does in America. 7.

What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**  **\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.  So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will impact developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.  Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.  Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.  We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.  The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular.  They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.  But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to have more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.  The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you all kinds of information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.  I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.  We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.  And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also having self-driving capabilities.  It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.  I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the actual manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.  But this Apple Car thing is so long out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.  And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.  I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.  So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.  I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.  This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.  So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of revenue, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by a big margin the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.  The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.  The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.  The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.  I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to have more vertical integration.  And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple gets. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based revenue including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.  So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.  I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.  In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.  In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.  So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.  I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.  I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.  This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.  Moving on, let’s see what interest revenue and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both revenues and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.  This would bring the company pre-tax $$$ to just over $104B in 2025.  Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.  So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in $$ after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.  I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.  So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.  I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.  So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.  Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?  The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.  So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?  Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.  So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.  Thank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.  [Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.  We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.  We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.  While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.  Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.  [Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn’t yet announced anything.  In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can’t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don’t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.  We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.  Let’s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman’s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US Gross domestic product by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a Gross domestic product growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

If you have followed my DDs in the past couple of months, you should have made some nice tendies on [CRSR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtbqwt/crsr_corsair_40c_may_21_2021_exp/), [TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ju4nji/tsla_vs_other_evs_why_do_happy_tsla_investors/), and [VLDR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdyhrf/vldr_there_are_no_flying_cars_in_your_future_but/). Sure, my DD on [SOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/) has not come to fruition (yet) but 3 for 4 in the last 2 months is not too shabby. In MLB, I would be a .750 hitter and would qualify for HOF but that’s a separate “Story Time” shit-posting for another day.  Today, I am here to share my next DD. And unlike my other DDs, this is a bit speculative.  TLDR: If Apple is building EVs, MGA is likely the manufacturer based on their past partnership and the fact that Apple likes to outsource manufacturing.  **So, what the hell is Magna?**  Today, let me tell you about this sleeping giant called MGA. Few years back (circa 2014-2016), when people first started hearing about Project Titan, aka Apple EV project, MGA was in talks to manufacture Apple EVs for Apple. Dozens of Magna’s engineers were working with Apple to develop Apple’s new baby.   For those who are not familiar with Magna, the company is considered as the world’s biggest contract manufacturer for cars. (Think FoxConn for iPhones or Taiwan Semiconductor for chips)    A big part of their business is to help automakers to manufacture their vehicles when these automakers lack the resources (i.e. factories) or time to build the cars themselves. For OEM automakers, their current and past customers include big names like BMW, Volkswagen and Aston Martin.  [Check out Bloomberg’s feature on MGA back in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-magna-international/)  **Ok. So they are like FoxConn to Taiwan Semiconductor, but for manufacturing cars. So why are they not 🚀 🚀 if they are in bed with Apple?**  Well, Apple’s Project Titan went through a lot of changes since 2016. It struggled with direction, leadership and technical challenges. the guy who lead the project, Bob Mansfield, left the company and then was brought back. They laid off a lot of people from the project and then retooled the scope of the project with focus on autonomous driving and a new battery technology. During this time, their previous deal with Magna also died out.  But now the project is back on track with a rumor to launch as early as 2024. Recently, various companies started mooning based on pure speculation that Apple might be using their parts for the project. (I.e. LIDAR)  However, there’s not much talk about who would build the cars. Well, Apple normally designs the product, but outsources the manufacturing. Considering that other EV manufacturers needed to build their own factories in various parts of the world, Apple would need to do the same. However, their business model would suggest that they would outsource the manufacturing and since MGA was once a partner for Project Titan, it is reasonable to think that Apple will choose MGA for future manufacturing as well. Eventually, news will reach the public but in absence of any news that Apple is making capital investment to build its own auto manufacturing factory, it would likely tap a third party like MGA because Apple lacks the expertise to manufacture cars themselves.  **Ok, But what if MGA is not picked by Apple? What then?**  Well, you ungrateful bastard. I’ve already told you that this DD is a bit different and it’s more speculative than the others.   Considering that MGA is the leader in this field, and Apple tapped them before, two things are clear. One, Apple showed their hand that they intend to outsource the manufacturing in the past. Two, MGA has the relationship and familiarity with the Apple Project.   But Magna has other trump cards in its deck. One, Fisher tapped MGA to build their electric SUVs and the production is expected to begin in 2022. As part of this deal, MGA received 6% of Fisher stock warrants so you know this relationship is going to be a long term partnership.  Secondly, LG Electronics formed a joint venture with MGA to develop EV power trains and other EV parts. LG works with General Motors and Jaguar, so this joint venture can potentially lead to deals with those automakers and it positioned MGA further as a leader in this field of car manufacturing.  Finally, even though they are strengthening their position in EV manufacturing, their bread and butter is their existing contracts with companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW and BMW. In China, MGA has even inked a deal to build entire electric cars for BAIC Group, as many as 180,000 cars annually with the first batch of cars arriving now.  **Recommendation**  Right now the stock is trading around $70~ per share with market cap of only $22 Billion.   Over the next 12 - 24 months, EVs continue to be a hot topic. As more and more people convert to EVs, more EV stocks will moon and MGA will benefit from that conversion. But, if and when Apple confirms MGA as their manufacturer as they disclose more info about their EV between now and 2024, this stock will 🚀 🚀 beyond your dreams.

This post isn’t to take it away from that.  But I’ve been having much more success by taking myself almost fully out of the details and looking at company’s from a birds eye view. Holding stocks or calls (that are out at least 3 months)  My current portfolio  Safe bets (this is where I re invest all of my options gains, this is all of the research I’ve done) Disney — amazing scope in industry, theme parks, streaming, movies, and brand name Sony — absolutely monster of a balance sheet. Dominant in consoles. Activision — one of the only gaming companies that push out thrilling and popular games  Also hold Amazon stocks but that’s through RSUs.  My options bets AES — energy stock, renewable energy. I’m Betting on a big contract or for it to gain traction on any news of government giving preferential treatment.  2/19/2021 13 27C  CCL — Carnival. They almost guaranteed are planning worst and best scenario in order to prep themselves for the 2021 season. A company this size will not allow itself to be turned to dust even for a global pandemic, something will be done and I’m betting on that. 4/16/2021 3 27.5C  XOM — monster of a balance sheet as well with focus on renewable energy. Oil will not go away in the next 5 years and they are known more of an energy stock nowadays rather than just oil. 7/16/2021 2 50C  BP — same as above 1/21/2022 4 30C  ATT — truly a gamble to see what will happen. Price has been depressed and with the amount of brand and exposure and customer base they have I do think they may make a comeback 1/21/2022 6 35C  Ford — betting on their new electric vehicles and the possibility of landing good contracts selling batteries. Also like their CEO, much more forward thinking.  1/21/2022 7 15C  Nokia — Full gamble here as well. They have good engineers and they have good programmers. They have the experience and they still have the name that people remember. Betting on a full reinvention of themselves, they also got a new Chief Strategy officer that I’ve no idea who is but hoping here they made a decent choice and he starts taking risks  1/20/23 18 7C  Veritone and Plug — just a couple hundred shares each IV is too high for the risk for me. Already made about a grand each but I’ve literally done no research on it but just overview stuff.

I think it's one of the best free ways to do some real time DD. It's flawed in many ways because it's not always clear why people are searching for something. Just because ""Ford Cars"" becomes a big search term it doesn't necessarily mean that Ford is going to go up, it might mean Ford cars began to explode, etc.  With that in mind, and also bearing in mind this is all *my opinion* on things, here are some of the search trends for GME.  https://imgur.com/a/rDktx4x  Checking the search term ""Gamestop Playstation"" lets you compare across years. What this chart means is that the search term ""Gamestop Playstation"" in Nov 2020 is about 400% larger than it has been since 2012. You'll note that the chart includes 2013, the year the PS4 was released.  The bump for Xbox is there but not as huge. It still does beat all of the last 9 years including the launch of the Xbone.  https://imgur.com/a/Jg4rA8g  Hang on because this is where it gets a little bumpy. I have contended that COVID is damping down interest in going to GME stores in person. That's a tough one to tease out of this data but I think you can get a proxy.  First, searches for ""is gamestop open""  https://imgur.com/a/rXAsSvt  That huge blue dildo at the end is a break from the past which would normally occur at Nov to Dec, this year it happened starting March. I think you can guess why. But why does this matter?  The next chart is ""gamestop trade in"" which we know is a big part of their business. You see a spike in 2013 when the last gen consoles were released. Then you see an even bigger spike the year after as people are getting new used games for the consoles they bought the year before. Then a long steady trend down, which makes sense.  Now pay close attention, when did this search term start to plunge way below its trendline, yes right as COVID started. I contend that COVID is suppressing interest in game trade ins and we will see a massive rebound when COVID gets its boot off our neck.  https://imgur.com/a/9gvSnpd   Long 10K shares, avg cost basis $14.50.

ATH was ~$9B cap back in 2007/2008 and a less high ~$6,5B cap in 2013. This would put share price today at $130 and $95 with the shares outstanding that GameStop currently has (69.75 million).   For the share price to reach $1000 would ""only"" take a $70B market cap. For reference, other companies with such a market cap include: CSX, CB, BDX, LRCX Don't know who they are? Neither do I. Boomer companies with large caps.  For a more conservative example, how would a $500 price valuation ($35B cap) look like compared to others in that range? SYY (food distribution), CMG (Chipotle), F (Ford) and EBAY (eBay).  Even comparing to Best Buy ($26B market cap) would already raise share price to $370  If Cohen does a complete turnaround for GameStop and makes it a household name in the gaming industry (something like Steam but EVERYTHING gaming related) then I can see $500 becoming pretty reasonable (might even be low-balling it). However even if he takes over that would be mid- to long-term valuations since it would take quite a bit of work to pull off all the changes. So what are we banking on right now? The positive earnings for Q4 + maybe some Cohen news to get the ball rolling to tendie land and maybe a mild short squeeze to help.  Perhaps. Or maybe there's still *some* chance for an infinity squeeze if MM uses logic.  With the current share price, for Boomer Sherman &amp; Co to issue the shelf order, it would dilute the shares with an additional 6-7 million shares (to get the $100 million worth). However what if they waited for the share to reach obscene heights (say $1000) they would reach their $100 million with only 100k shares. Thus very minimal dilution would occur.  Obviously this has a lot of speculation in it, so don't take what I said too seriously. I mainly wrote this down so I can visualize it better for myself and confirm my own bias that GME is going to the moon.  Oh and fun fact; according to the ownership list for WSB, we own approximately 3.8 Million shares of GameStop, 5.8% or ~$57 million worth of GME (soon to be Billions). 🚀🚀🚀"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1721220|public|confidence|self|GME Interesting Squeeze Facts &amp; Market Cap &amp; Future Valuations|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgsl8r/gme_interesting_squeeze_facts_market_cap_future/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||2020-12-20|FORD

No? You are not some old ass boomer and therefore, you don’t even know what The Jetsons are?  Ok, fair enough. But chances are, you are probably retarded because you are wasting your time in this sub looking for tendies. And retarded people think the flying cars are coming (just like in The Jetsons).  But I hate to break it to you. The flying cars are not coming. Why? Because the popularity of this sub has turned most of the population quite retarded. No one is working in a garage somewhere working on a flying car. They are all watching Jim Cramer talking about autists and in turn, we are wasting time away in this sub for the next shitty stock that might make you tendies.  However, self driving cars are quite real. And today, we are going to look at the market leader in the technology that will allow us to get there.  **Self Driving Cars? How Real is This Shit?**  Oh, this shit is quite real. So real, in fact, you will hear about them often between now and the next 24 months.   1. All the Boomer car companies want to be valued like tech stocks. So GM, Hyundai, Ford, VW, and you name them. They are all entering into some sort of partnership with tech companies that are making the tech that is required to make this a reality. (And it doesn’t have to be full self driving. Any semi auto driving and driver assistance tech are high in demand) Call it a FOMO effect. The boomer car companies have been left behind by Tesla and other EV companies (in terms of investor excitement and stock valuation). So they don’t want to be left behind in this trend. So they are all signing up and spooning each other with companies like NVDA, Intel’s Mobileye, Google, Baidu, etc.  2. The taxi industry as we know it, will be transformed once again. Why? Remember when Uber and Lyft disrupted the traditional taxi/cab industry by offering the same service using an App? I mean, who wants to walk outside and hail a cab (hoping to catch one) these days. No one, unless you are a boomer. Well, the same companies that disrupted the traditional taxi industry are motivated to disrupt it once again because of the on-going debate on whether Uber drivers should be classified as employees or contractors. Solution? Get rid of the drivers and make them all autonomous to make CEOs rich and drivers unemployed.  3. The tech is here and available. And the key technology is something called LiDAR and the software platform that operates it.  **What is LiDAR and why should I care?**  Think of LiDAR as an eye of the self-driving vehicle providing it a 360 degree view. Just like a car that is driven and operated by a human being, a self driving car will need to figure out how to operate the vehicle thru traffic, potholes, trees and other obstacles on the road. Well, that’s what the LiDAR technology provides. It serves as the eye for the self driving cars so it can move in and out of the traffic and get its passengers from Point A to Point B.  **Ok, LiDAR is like an eye. But why should I care about Velodyne?**  Well, Velodyne is the undisputed leader in this field and right now, they have the backers (Ford, Baidu, Nikon, Hyundai, etc).  They are the established market leader, with first mover advantage. Per Needham, Velodyne is expected to own 60% of the market share of autonomous vehicle market by 2024. They have 300+ customers with $800 Million in contracted revenue thru 2024. Additionally, there’s an opportunity to incrementally add 60%+ increase in revenue over the same time period.  With their entrenched existing customers, there is a high switching cost. So unlike LAZR (which just lost Intel’s Mobileye), their existing customer would not be able to easily switch their supplier or look for another supplier without incurring significant switching cost.  But the most important aspect of their competitive advantage in the LiDAR sensor market has to do with their pricing. When David Hall first participated in DARPA sponsored autonomous vehicle competition in 2005~, each LiDAR Sensor unit cost about $80,000. Today, Velodyne is able to sell similar LiDAR sensors between $100 - $600 per unit. No other competitor can offer a similarly competitive product at the same price range.   Velodyne dominated this market for over 13 years. They have a broad product portfolio (not just LIDAR sensors) with global sales and mass scale manufacturing capabilities. They are not tied down to automotive market either as they currently expand to about 25+ new market segments.  Additionally, they can upsell to its existing costumers with their Vella Collision Warning System. This is Velodyne’s software solution to power their LiDAR products. They can offer automotive manufacturers with advanced capabilities including auto pilot, collision avoidance, pedestrian automotive emergency braking and more. Multiple automotive OEMs are in development on Velodyne’s ADAS projects with initial deliveries happening right now. There are no BS research turned production deals like LAZR. They have real revenue, real products and real customers.   Today, only 25% of their revenue is generated from LiDAR related technology. 75% of the revenue comes from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Robotics and Industrial Mapping, Shuttles, Smart City Delivery, etc.  **Ok. So they got cool stuff and real customers. But what about their growth prospects?**  Well, you greedy bastard. This company’s growth aspects are primed to make you tendies over the next couple of years. In fact, this might be the kind of dream growth stock that you can bank on.  1. Revenue Growth: Velodyne’s projected revenue for 2020 is around $100 Million. They are expected to grow their revenue to $150 Million next year, $250 Million in 2022, $412 Million in 2023 and $684 Million in 2024.   2. Earnings Growth: Velodyne is expected to incur losses of ($50 Million) this year. But they are expected to reduce this loss to ($8 Million) next year and be profitable from 2022 and forward. By 2024, they expect to be record EBITDA of $150 Million~.  3. Gross Margin: Velodyne’s gross margin on their LIDAR products is around 20% today. They expect to double this gross margin to 40% next year and continue to increase the margin from there.  4. Product Mix Trend for Revenue: Today, significant portion of Velodyne’s revenue comes from LIDAR and other automotive technology. But they plan to balance this out by increasing revenue from their software and license/subscription products going forward.  5. Amazon’s Zoox just launched a plan to start a robotaxi service in CA and NV by end of 2021 or early 2022 using Velodyne’s LIDAR sensors. BAIDU is expected to enter its own EV vehicles and they are investors of Velodyne and can certainly use many of the technologies (not just LIDAR) offered by VLDR. Nikon is using VLDR’s LIDAR tech for its lineup of products (similar to iPhone 12 Pro using LiDAR) going forward. As a market leader in the LIDAR tech and also leader in pricing advantage with backers such as Hyundai, BAIDU, Ford, etc, this is just the beginning.  **TL;DR**  Conclusion:  1. They have far superior LIDAR product and they can sell it at much affordable price point. They have over 300+ customers and the customers cannot simply switch to another supplier due to high cost of switching.  2. Current market cap is around $ 4 Billion (give or take). In comparison, LAZR’s market valuation is around $14 Billion. Never mind that LAZR has no real revenue (i.e. their recent filing indicates that all of their revenue is from interest income), lost Mobileye as customer only about a month after inking a deal, and they don’t have bullshit “research turned into production” deals either. So the bottom line is that this stock is super cheap.  3. They will be profitable by 2022 and increase their revenue by almost seven folds by 2024. They are the undisputed leader with the right technology and the right backers/partners. Good news is only starting and for a change, it’s still not too late for you to get in.

Ford and a slew of other boomer crap are M&amp;Aing like nuts, but they're way too late and bloated to get a sizeable chunk of the business.  We need to look for already established businesses verticalized in similar sectors, ideally having both manufacturing refrigeration systems and components, as well as strong geographically distributed logistic networks.

There will be more hype in Tesla models then there ever has been in any other car maker. Tesla will be the iPhone of cars in terms of demand, and Tesla will completely dominate the EV market from 2025 - 2030. Why you ask?  Competitor's battery tech is so far behind Tesla, that in order to sell an EV at a competitive price in the next 5 years they'd have to sell their EVs at a loss. All the while, autombile manufacturers that rely on combustion engines will be losing sales to the EV market, and if they did put out an EV (not even likely at a positive margin), they'd only be cannibalizing their combustion engine sales. Tesla will easily dominate the EV market in the next 5 years. And by dominate, I mean obliterateuntil they're practically the only EVs on the road.  Even if competitors did sell an EV at a comparable price to Tesla models. Why would anyone buy them when Tesla is the only company in the world that has software for autonomous driving? Tesla will dominate the autonomous driving market until 2035 or 2040 and probably far beyond. The only company that can catch up to the self-driving technology that TSLA has, and then not be too chickenshit to actually start implementing it might be Alphabet... and maybe Apple? But guess what? They don't make cars. Maybe they can sell it to Nissan when Nissan finally catches up in battery technology by 2040? or 2050?.. and also redesign their Leaf to not look stupid as shit? There you go Tesla bears.. I threw you a bone.  Tesla's EVs make 40% margin. If autonomous driving is added on as a subscription, then Tesla will make back the cost of the car and then some in only 5 years or so. Robo taxis will be paying Tesla indefinitely.. many many times the actual cost of the car. This gives plenty of incentive for Tesla to create cars that actually last 300k - 500k miles. Creating cars that last 500k miles would reduce operating costs and the need to keep building factories and spitting out worthless cars at a crazy pace the way Ford and Toyota do. Yay for the environment too! Tesla might even consider selling cars at a lower margin.. 20% if they knew that you'd be buying subscriptions to autonomous driving (maybe a contract agreement?). This will further the domination of the EV market. Eventually Tesla will have millions of cars on the road, with the drivers subscribed to self driving and the money will just pour in. ABSOLUTE. MARKET. DOMINATION. All the while, other car companies might be getting caught up in battery tech to sell a $30k car but \*holds in laughter\* Tesla will sell you a car at only $20k if you agree to a year of an autonomous driving subscription!  Now why would anyone buy a Nissan Leaf when you can have a Tesla for $30k (or $20k with a year of autonomous driving! pay as you go!) that actually lasts for a couple decades? By the way, value Tesla Customer! Don't forget to sign in on the app and buy a month of autonomous driving for your road trip next summer!  Tesla will start selling car insurance as well. Make any modifications you need to your car insurance policy through the app. You can be as granular as adding collision for a few months, or comprehensive while you're on vacation and worried where you might need to park. But don't worry investors, Tesla won't be swindled on the cutomizable car insurance.. they know how you drive.. they have the data.. a loooot of data.   &amp;#x200B;  By 2035 or 2040, Tesla will be \*the\* name associated with all your automobile needs.  &amp;#x200B;  My price target: $2800/share by 2026. That's a $2.65T cap.  Additional external things to help make this price target a reality:  Inflation going up per JPow's goal of ""averaging"" 2% a year (any year where consumers struggle will usually result in a lower than 2% inflation.. giving free rein on the money printer button), big money putting their big money into assets for the next few years at least to avoid the higher than 2% inflation.  ETFs create bubbles. In my opinion, not the bad kind of bubbles. The kind of bubble where companies are valued much greater than a traditional valuation because noobs are buying the fuck out of SPY. Guess who gets to join the ""I'm buying you because I don't understand stocks!"" party?  &amp;#x200B;  My positions:  First, I bought a March 2021 $1920 the day of the split announcement for $23k. This is largely what funded my current positions:  73 shares  Sept $420c  My idea:  I will likely put all $75k of my portfolio into TSLA shares and/or LEAPS, and make regular semi-monthly contributions (24 times a year) of about $625 ($15k annually) for the next 5 years straight into shares. In moments of relatively lower volatility or a stupid low dip, I might sell some shares to buy ITM LEAPS calls, and vice versa after a pump.. once hitting a 100-200% gain on the LEAPS, sell it and put it back into shares. Essentially, maintain a decent delta on the ride to $2800. Sell the occasional covered call, but be careful and patient as fuck to get a ridiculously high strike that's pumped as hell. Just these last couple weeks you could sell a $1000 strike for a few hundred dollars. Put covered call premiums into more TSLA shares.  &amp;#x200B;  I've done the math. Assumptions:  TSLA going straight up to $2800 linearly to the beginning of 2026  $75k initial investment in shares. $625 semi-monthly contributions up to 2026 (additional $15k\*5=$75k in contributions for $150k total)  No consideration of leveraging with LEAPS and no consideration of selling covered calls  This will yield $640k in Jan 2026.  A lower target of $2000/share yields $435k in Jan 2026.

This will cause my semi-monthly contributions to ""buy low.""  &amp;#x200B;  Reasons I might make less:  fucking up with a covered call  TSLA hitting target before 2026, this would cut back on the number of contributions I can make prior to the target and my contributions would be ""buying high.""

Most of this companies like Fisker entirely base their valuation on projected revenue estimates and have not a single unit sold and driving out on the streets.  Lightning eMotors has delivered more commercial electric vehicles this year in the US than [Ford and Daimler combined](https://twitter.com/LightningeMtrs/status/1332377396192837632).  **Lightnings customers are Amazon, DHL, Ikea, Keurig/Dr.Pepper** and many more who buy their electric delivery vans as you can see in the [investor presentation](https://www.gigcapitalglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/Project-Power-Announcement-Deck_vF.pdf). This might not seem like a big deal, but it is. Lightning eMotors actually already does today what many other companies claim to be able to do in a couple years if everything goes by plan. They have many large orders lined up as well and sold over 1,500 units in the last few months alone. Lightning said in October that it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, ramped up production and that it had doubled its workforce.  Additionally to the delivery vans they are also making [larger trucks](https://lightningemotors.com/lightningelectric-chevrolet-6500xd/) as well as [buses](https://lightningemotors.com/buses/). With Biden as a president we will see a heavy demand for this type of electrified vehicles and a lot of states will roll out their own programs to subsidize companies which invest into electric vehicles. And they also develop and distribute their own charging infrastructure like Chargepoint: [https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations](https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations)  This is the only company which provides everything for commercial customers to quickly electrify large fleets and to run them cost efficient and reliable. They are backed by big oil, BP invested $40 million in them. In the US alone there were [12.4 million commercial vehicles sold in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265914/commercial-vehicle-sales-in-the-united-states/).  This is a HUGE untapped market which isn't addressed by Tesla yet, and there already is more demand for electric delivery vans [than can be fulfilled](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/09/09/electric-delivery-vans-high-demand).  Don't make the mistake to think that all of these EV companies are garbage because some like NKxx are. This seems to be one of the few like Chargepoint which actually have their shit together.  **The best thing about GIK/Lightning:**  The valuation of Lightning eMotors is just 0.8 billion.  NK\*\* currently trades at 7 billion.  PIC/XLfleet currently trading at 2.4 billion.  Hyliion at 2.7 billion.  CIIC/Arrival at 15 billion.

This is my next big EV play and I am confident it will work out just as great as my last one did.  GIK already traded at $16 in pre-market but lost a little of its gains on Friday as all EV stocks had a slight sell off. I am confident this will go back to $16 by Monday and might even see $20 next week.  **Position:**  5,000 shares, 1,000 warrants|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1696391|public|confidence|self|GIK - The company that delivered more commercial electric vehicles in the US than Ford and Daimler combined|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcmixw/gik_the_company_that_delivered_more_commercial/|no_ads|0.0||dark|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'ak8LrsFoXrtXxcaHoF-25IwzRR3cFGmQHyVJhV_MJpM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 58, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/L-Q_rwTrLCPLWzfad2FoNarAMvseD01OYkpvbzfCvq8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6548f1b5f50953adfbba2251853a245b0550a2ff', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 76, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/L-Q_rwTrLCPLWzfad2FoNarAMvseD01OYkpvbzfCvq8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=15ca5689dbf5e4e88df33ff4bcab6773fb9a94f2', 'width': 140}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-12-14|FORD

This is a very long post just so you know but let’s go over some of the latest news on Tesla before moving on to some analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock.  So, Tesla has seen a huge move to the upside after the SP500 inclusion [news](https://ibb.co/j3F9CJM), as the stock started to surge with a 10% spike in just the first day and continue to [gain](https://ibb.co/fDz4J19) around 50% since that news came out, as the company has surpassed a [market cap](https://ibb.co/JRMGspK) of $500B, that means the company is valued more than Toyota, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda combined.  The EV world has seen a huge spike in the last couple of years and will continue to benefit a lot from the move to green energy. The EV short-term share of [sales](https://ibb.co/QpXc1Kj) is expected to rise in China to 15% by 2023 with the rest of the world lagging behind, but in the long-term, by 2040, most of the world’s regions are expected to have over 30% market share for EVs with China, Europe and the US leading the way as the Global market share should reach around 60% by 2040.  Also, Tesla seems to be on track to make new investments in [Indonesia](https://ibb.co/SndLK1N) as they hunt for Nickel, the most important component in batteries. The [price](https://ibb.co/wKfBckY) of this commodity has gone up almost 20% this year, hurting the possibility of Tesla to either make bigger profits or make cheaper cars that will attract even more buyers.  Meanwhile, it was just [announced](https://ibb.co/ZYfNpP6) that Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management with the ticker AIV in the SP500 which saw the its [stock](https://ibb.co/wK9YqrK) value plummet after the news. They will also replace Occidental Petroleum with the ticker [OXY](https://ibb.co/yFF01HH) in the SP100.  Other good [news](https://ibb.co/pxZypr4) came for Tesla from China, as they reported an increase of more than 100% year over year in EVs and hybrid car sales. With sales of electric cars from Tesla surpassing 21.000 in the last month. While overall car [sales](https://ibb.co/FXyXnhG) also increased in China more than 11% since last year to over 2.3M.  Also, the company has declared that they will [continue](https://ibb.co/s9Wp63Q) to sell around $5B in shares at market price from time to time. This usually is bad news for companies as the value of individual stocks gets diluted. Tesla is seeking to strengthen the balance sheet as they will have more than $20B in cash reserves after the latest stock offering in the next year, as the total cash reserves have been [increasing](https://ibb.co/C9GVYR6) steadily, as well as using part of the funds for general corporate purposes by getting out of the debt of the company while also continuing to innovate, as the company is [forecasted](https://ibb.co/ZdYPdX3) to spend around $50B in capex and R&amp;D in the next 5 years, more than double what GM is targeting to spend in the same period.  My opinion is that Musk is brilliant, he is selling stock at very good prices as young retail investors just keep buying this stock at any price. And with $5B in [SHARES](https://ibb.co/CVK554V) being under 1% of the market cap right now, this will help the company in the long run as more available money brings more stability and probably more research and developments.  So, before even starting, you should now that I am neither a convinced bear or bull that will not change his mind on Tesla. If you do believe this next valuation for the company, then you can agree that Tesla will not only be a car maker in the future, as they keep expanding into more &amp; more businesses like network services, energy storage, the internet-of-cars and even insurance.  The company is also undergoing major growth projects with 3 new [factories](https://ibb.co/mbMZKKX) fin different stages of construction in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, this will help them to have the ability to respond to the huge demand in the EV market alongside the already established Freemont and Buffalo factories.  I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.  This are my 2023 [projections](https://ibb.co/cyr3Sr8) for Tesla, I expect them to have around $112B in automotive sales revenue by that year, as I expect they will be able to sell around 2.8M cars worldwide at around a $40K price, which is way below the average $54K they sell cars at the moment. So, as the cheaper models become available, I expect this to decrease to around $40K, that seems pretty reasonable to me. I will give them around a 3% of the automotive sales in lease revenue, as they have stood around this rate in the past, as not many people lease Tesla’s.  I will also give them the benefit of the doubt of almost doubling the Energy revenues, as they stand at around $580M in the last quarter, so that would be around $2.4B on an annual basis. And will also give them around 10% of the automotive sales in services and other revenues as this has been a pretty steady number in the past for the company.  You can see in the latest [earnings](https://ibb.co/FKyY0mm) report that the company has been improving almost in every department in the last quarters with the exception of Q1 this year as they were forced to shut down part of the operations at the end of Q1 and the start of Q2.  This is what my projections are based on in both revenues and expenses.   So, about the [expenses](https://ibb.co/WPYsV2g) expenses in 2023, I will lower the expense margin from around 72% where it stands at the moment to around 70% where Musk’s target is in the future as this has been improving in the last years for automotive sales. I will also keep the same expense margin on leases and services. While on Energy expenses I will be more conservative and give them a 90% expense margin, even if this might improve to 80-85% if they do want to raise the price for the products and sacrifice some growth.  This means that they will have a gross [income](https://ibb.co/qsbTKCw) of around $37.5B in 2023.  And meanwhile the company is also expected to have some big investments going in 2023 as well, as I made a [projection](https://ibb.co/mXqjr5n) based on past expenses that rounded up to around $9B. They will also have some interest [expenses](https://ibb.co/DzqP6jp) due as the company does still have significant debt but they are working on lowering that as I previously mentioned with new money being raised from time to time by selling stocks.  I will also keep them in the same tax bracket as in the past at a 28% level which gives the company an [income](https://ibb.co/yd6gC03) after tax of almost $20B.  So, guys, at the moment there are over 1.1B shares outstanding of Tesla.  And with my current [projections](https://ibb.co/q1qTDMs) the company would make almost $18 per share in earnings in 2023.  That would mean the stock is trading at 34 times future earnings right now, which compared to the insane current price to earnings [ratio](https://ibb.co/DCPSp0W) which stands at over 1200, that would be amazing. If the stock would trade at 40x forward earnings, which is very low compared to lowest P/E in the last 10 years, that would mean the stock would trade at over 700$ and if you slightly increase that to a 50x future PE the stock would jump to almost 900$  Tesla has been mostly improving its free cash flow to around $1.4B in the last [quarter](https://ibb.co/Q6rq81y), which was only hit at the begging of this year, while also increasing the total amount of operating cash flow.  Here are some of the [highlights](https://ibb.co/bJ6nCMK) that were reported in the latest earnings report.  As the company increased the balance sheet by almost $6B. While the company would have posted an even bigger earnings per share if the stock-based compensations would have been removed, as they accounted for over $540M.  The company reported record vehicle deliveries, profitability and free cash flow while continuing to develop the 3 big factories.  Since the earnings reports they have also started to rollout the Full-Self-Driving feature in more and more cars and kept that promise.  The company has [posted](https://ibb.co/48f0RkN) a beat of earnings expectations in the last quarter, and is expected to see an increase in both revenue and earnings, with the growth expected to continue in the future based on what [analysts](https://ibb.co/SsvpySz) expect to see, as they expect over 50% increases year over year for each of the next 4 quarters.  So, I will give you 3 targets for my bear, normal and bull cases for this company. I [expect](https://ibb.co/0JZt94D) the lowest the stock can reach by 2023 is around 700$ which would give you a rate of return of almost 15% by 2023. While my base case price target for Tesla is around 850$ which would bring you almost 40% returns on the capital invested by 2023. And my bull case for the stock would see the stock valued at over $1K, that would mean an impressive 72% return on investment by 2023.  So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://ibb.co/qYGyxCF) that I have projected for Tesla in 2023, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, with only a couple of big assumptions that they will increase the Energy revenues and the Automotive profit margins slightly.  Keep in mind, this might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Tesla has had in the last 10years. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/t4NsKbD) in value by more 760% in just the past year and is almost 10.000% up in the last 10 years. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company, but are you willing to bet against Elon Musk? Short sellers have been [crushed](https://ibb.co/XYTkdXf) as they continued to bet against him.  Investors, and mostly the young investors in Tesla don’t think at the old &amp; traditional metrics and valuations, they believe that Musk is the new Steve Jobs so they can’t get enough of this stock at the moment.   So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Tesla?  Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/mBhVLcW). Starting with the stock split, the stock had a pretty big run which ended with a buy the news &amp; sell the event correction in the stock. After that Tesla continued to trade sideways for over 2 months before spiking once again after the news that the company will be included in the SP500.   The company had an impressive run from 408$ to almost 650$ in just 3 weeks, and since that moment the stock has seen some resistance at those high levels especially in the 600-630$ range.   I think we might see a small correction in the stock, to the 550$ levels as this coincides with the 21 EMA, the 21 SMA and the next level of support.  Also, after the SP500 news, the stock was bought on massive volume and was in overbought territory with an RSI over 70, as things have just cooled off a little in the last days with the RSI dropping below overbought territory.  Meanwhile, while expectations have been increasing from retail investors, as they are expecting the stock to always go higher, the latest [news](https://ibb.co/gwj8XKB) that they will have an extended production shutdown after Christmas and maybe also some panic selling if the stock doesn’t go up on the 18th or 21st, as most retail investors probably expect the stock to go even higher after the SP500 inclusion, may bring Tesla into correction territory.  The spike in stocks after inclusion in index funds has been proven wrong time and time again. Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/Hd9n0yy), which shows that companies between 2008 and 2017 saw a negative 2% average return in the next 20 days after the inclusion despite seeing a huge run before the actual day.   So, what would I do? Well, I owned Tesla stock until about a week ago and sold out at $590 with more than 40% in gains, as I think there will be a slight correction in the stock, and I will get back in the stock after that correction does occur. Remember, I think this stock is going higher in the long-run as my 2023 predictions show, but I did want to take some risk off the table at the moment, as it will be a highly volatile moment for the company. I think there might be a lot of people willing to sell shares on the 18th and 21st, and this might flood the market and drive the price lower, as I think most investors and money managers have already adjusted their portfolios before this [date](https://ibb.co/6W9Y9wD), while a lot of retail investors will be left with stocks that they want to get rid off and fewer and fewer people to buy it.

Ford? Volkswagen? No. Tesla!  No other car company has a monopoly on an entire planetary economy. Think about it: millions of future captive consumers who can only buy Tesla cars. Everyone on Mars will need to commute with a car because there is no air so you can't just walk around or take public transport. Also, gas cars don't work on Mars because the lack of oxygen makes combustion impossible. Plus, the 2018 Falcon Heavy flight that launched a Tesla into space proved that there is market demand for watching Teslas get launched into space. Every time they launch one they can make money by putting commercials on the YouTube livestream. That's basically software as a service, which means that Tesla should be valued like a software company. Don't forget that the Martian government will give huge subsidies to EV's because Elon will be dictator for life and he supports EV's.

This is actually possible?!  Then I was like alright....I have about 12k in savings (I’m 20 years old) , I might aswell try to be like wsbgod and make hella money right?  You might see where this is going...  I was playing around with some stocks as soon as I downloaded RH and made like $80 off nvax and then I was like holy shit this is legit, then can you guess what I did next?  I saw a bunch of people on here saying shit like “just buy puts it’s literally free money”   And I did, I put in $5k into my robinhood account immediately and then bought puts in Ford, Zillow, Uber, and that ceasar casino shit.  $5k into puts the EXACT day before Unlimited QE was released.  Yeah....  And I didn’t panic sell at all, I saw people saying to diamond hand so I did....I held all the fucking way until I cashed out with $500 left....   I was like shit....I don’t even feel anything losing $4.5k  I really need to make that money back though....  So now you can see where this is going again....  I put in $2.5k more and started playing with more options  I actually brought that money up to $3.5k with a few decent plays.  and then a major epiphany came to me one day  and if I followed the epiphany my life would have changed.  you will be able to see in a screenshot further down below   With this new epiphany I had I put in all the $3.5k in apple/spy calls when spy was like $270 and apple was around the same price  and then can you guesss what happened the day after I put my calls in?  Spy drops $10 overnight  Aapl also drops an absurd amount  Can you guess what I do?  I keep holding down when I’m already down thousands and then I make the dumbest mistake of my life when I saw Spy drop even more in the same day.   I sell when I have $500 left....again  I punch myself in the face for losing my money and I was like I’m fucking done I quit forver...  Then I watch spy moon back $20 in a few days when i’m out of my position....  The world fucking hates me....

Lightning eMotors has delivered more commercial electric vehicles this year in the US than [Ford and Daimler combined](https://twitter.com/LightningeMtrs/status/1332377396192837632).  One of their customers is Amazon, which buys their electric delivery vans as you can see in the [company video](https://twitter.com/LightningeMtrs/status/1318581179977768962). You can read more details on this [here](https://insideevs.com/news/392555/video-amazon-electric-delivery-trucks/). This might not seem like a big deal, but it is. Lightning eMotors actually already does today what many other companies claim to be able to do in a couple years if everything goes by plan. They have many large orders lined up as well, like this one for [600 vehicles](https://www.fleetowner.com/fleet-management/press-release/21144765/fluid-truck-orders-600-lightning-systems-evs). Lightning said in October that it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, ramped up production and that it had doubled its workforce.  Additionally to the delivery vans they are also making [larger trucks](https://lightningemotors.com/lightningelectric-chevrolet-6500xd/) as well as [buses](https://lightningemotors.com/buses/). With Biden as a president we will see a heavy demand for this type of electrified vehicles and a lot of states will roll out their own programs to subsidize companies which invest into electric vehicles. And they also develop and distribute their own charging infrastructure like Chargepoint: [https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations](https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations)  This is the only company which provides everything for commercial customers to quickly electrify large fleets and to run them cost efficient and reliable. They are backed by big oil, BP invested $40 million in them. In the US alone there were [12.4 million commercial vehicles sold in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265914/commercial-vehicle-sales-in-the-united-states/).  This is a HUGE untapped market which isn't addressed by Tesla yet, and there already is more demand for electric delivery vans [than can be fulfilled](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/09/09/electric-delivery-vans-high-demand).  Don't make the mistake to think that all of these EV companies are garbage because some like NKLA are. This seems to be one of the few like Chargepoint which actually have their shit together. I am expecting a stock price of $25 minimum within the next few weeks, if it reaches just HALF of the valuation of NKLA right now this could actually go to $40.

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let’s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**  Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.  The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)  The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.  Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter.   The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.  While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.  Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million  Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.  Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.  This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA  [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don’t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.  While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don’t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.  A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market.   While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand.   Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner’s decision to send all they’re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn’t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.  And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave &amp; Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

Ford stock sells for around $9.20 a share and makes small up and down movements so you can't get wiped out by YOLOing or FOMOing it. You can't get wiped out by buying and holding it. You can't get wiped out by buying and selling options on it unless you are seriously stupid - in which case just buy and sell stock and leave options alone. 3. If you buy and hold it you will make money. You will not get rich overnight, but if you stick with it you will make money and not lose money.   That's it.

The grid you’re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn’t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&amp;E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)  Tesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You’ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere.   &amp;#x200B;  2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **–** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you’ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you’re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet.   Since Sun doesn’t shine at night, and sometimes it’s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla’s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla’s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&amp;E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla’s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man.   &amp;#x200B;  3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage –** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you’ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn’t buy a house that doesn’t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future.   4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs –** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It’s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it’s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist.   &amp;#x200B;  The solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who’d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that’s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they’re building from scratch.   &amp;#x200B;  **5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that’s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it’s laughable generally to even think something like “we’re gonna make our own business software”. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don’t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )           **6)** **Selling Insurance Products –** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance “an auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business”. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you’re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They’re currently offering it in California only.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines –** As per Elon, he doesn’t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they’re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it’s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They’ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn’t know anything about vaccines? Well, he’s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac – a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.           **8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles –** Oh no…Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren’t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they’re building. Don’t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;)   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories –** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn’t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you’ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla’s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn’t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won’t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?           **10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) –** So we’re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you’re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla’s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn’t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with “better chip” next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla’s range doesn’t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let’s not even talk about compute  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- ""Tesla Dojo""** **-** So this is something the industry hadn’t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.           **12)**  **Mine lithium –** Hold your horses, it’s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they’ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they’ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they’ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage.   &amp;#x200B;  **13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries –** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They’re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won’t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla’s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won’t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.  **The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1645563|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/X6xgpy6c6_p83EPFTotP-e4L6429JgJWjDg6PNyK0MY.jpg|Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5axun/tesla_for_dummies_and_5_year_olds/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'L_befk8IPVwDg3Gsy3OE9igWe-lNO11NwbQxQhsacm4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcb6987fdcf6ab4b094385c7d327be9442abe76', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac2201002117eff4cf5114a0a3b8befcee77f3fc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc496b936c57795a6e8e2f1559095725564576d1', 'width': 320}, {'height': 335, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c8acb4f7cf034fb289dc7fa12129c4e4bc0d1c', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d7d1d30df70508aedfb4a13f9a93c4761233ae2', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 550, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=dc640b4e8015df97f0d279528dbe9f1bf606ab97', 'width': 1050}, 'variants': {}}]}|{'8eu1y40uhs261': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '8eu1y40uhs261', 'm': 'image/jpg', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f94bb9297d072ecde125a914327d8f0b48b558f', 'x': 108, 'y': 91}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d198674b002066f29bdc16b545a6f7e027b539', 'x': 216, 'y': 183}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eb99cbe830de03318e970b2f01db77d2cd27518', 'x': 320, 'y': 271}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1b5a59aeb80c71bbf8c0bb44711552f66a446b', 'x': 640, 'y': 542}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0b8c61cdc560c52e032e3688c427b42f2c43c83', 'x': 960, 'y': 813}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=977&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=874bd5b0445835ea5333b36d153ed8d7fdf23f62', 'x': 977, 'y': 828}, 'status': 'valid'}}|118.0|140.0|||||||||2020-12-02|FORD

Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by **many automakers** to allow higher levels of driver assistance right up to making them capable of **self-driving**. The combined company will retain the name Luminar Technologies Inc. and list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""LAZR”. Since the announcement in august, GMHI stock is up 38%, bringing the mkt cap to $1.7 Bln. The deal should be completed by Q1 2021 and the merge pro forma implied enterprise value of approximately $2.9 Bln and a market capitalization of approximately $3.4 Bln, so today we are trying to understand if there’s more room for tendies after the *bullish bonanza* of the previous week.  **Gentlemen you had my curiosity ... but now you have my attention**  There are some serious players behind this deal so let’s break them down:The deal includes $400 million of cash from Gores Metropoulos, whose founder is a private equity professional, $200 million financing by investors including tech billionaire **Peter Thiel** (PayPal, Palantir), GoPro Inc founder Nick Woodman, Volvo Cars Tech Fund and VectoIQ, the firm that helped Nikola Corp go public through a SPAC.  https://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e60ca72eda76e4b79edc07b46efc8ed47ca96e92  Not only, they have a long list of clients who are all willing to pay big bucks to get their hands on sensors as soon as 2022.   https://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2126f96feceb9796ca9fe90880f45abf687c6fcf  **Ehy but w8 a sec, I can see NIO there but no TESLA, WHERE’S MUSK DADDY?!?...Why Tesla Won’t Use LIDAR**  *Let me quote the greatest absolute madman of our century: LIDAR is a fool’s errand… and anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed.*   LIDARS are expensive and prone to be damaged, also not very smart in recognizing object, that’s why Musk has opted for the proprietary VISION software which enables TESLA cams to understand the surrounding environment instead of shooting stupid lazer beams. Surely a great approach but right now their technology has a gap to bridge as they stated in one of their last meetings. Whether they will succeed or not isn’t really important for a company which aims to get on the market hopefully sooner than them. Obviously, companies such as Daimler and Volvo (which historically sold **safety** as their key selling point)  would be very happy to sell AD4 cars by 2022.     **Ok but why tf should I buy shares of a company founded by a 17 years old dropout?**   Surely there are many companies working on similar projects such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Aurora, which aim to reach level 5 of autonomous driving (fully autonomous), but Luminar hits a different market. With a more modest target of hitting level 4 of autonomous driving, Luminar focuses on long-distance vision, key for highway driving. Yet, this is also a crowded market since players like Velodyne and others exist. Well not so crowded maybe, Velodyne has lost clients in the last year, it had Ford but they partnered with Luminar...they had Weymo (Google) but they went for their own road just as Tesla. Not to mention that Velodyne sensors have a crazy price at $25K.  **Since this is a DD post, I will not get into the technical details of why their technology has** ***some*** **breakthroughs, but let’s break down some more numbers**  We don’t have balance sheets so we will have to rely on their presentation (which is where all the images come from btw). They expect 90% of future revenue coming from their 50+ already signed partnerships, and with a 50% + margin, selling both hardware **AND** software, this could be a great company to invest in (or just go for quick tendies who am I to judge).   https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16d5769f3da85b8b7bdc4074a38b04348d8c7860  You can check further technical details about their technology and implementation on their presentation but the last figures I want to concentrate on is the following: as of 2020 there is no other LIDAR long-vision competitor, also their price tag is about $1000 for the IRIS sensor, which is 25 times cheaper than its closest competitor. This could really scale up quickly if the outsourcing production process is handled correctly, which by the way will take place in Thailand and Mexico.  \- *Archimede Gang*  **Resources:**   [**https://www.luminartech.com/announce\_gores\_luminar/**](https://www.luminartech.com/announce_gores_luminar/)   **Sec filings:**   [**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex992.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex992.htm)    **Press release:**   [**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex991.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex991.htm) **Reuters:**   [**https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/auto-startup-luminar-to-go-public-in-34-billion-deal-2274664**](https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/auto-startup-luminar-to-go-public-in-34-billion-deal-2274664)    **WIRED article on why all these companies can’t survive in the long run, but who cares LT right?**    [**https://www.wired.com/story/too-many-lidar-companies-cant-all-survive/**](https://www.wired.com/story/too-many-lidar-companies-cant-all-survive/)    **Price:**   [**https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/volvo-to-use-luminars-lidar-in-production-vehicles-to-unlock-automated-driving-on-highways/#:\~:text=Luminar%20has%20previously%20said%20its,limited%20purposes%20like%20driver%20assistance**](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/volvo-to-use-luminars-lidar-in-production-vehicles-to-unlock-automated-driving-on-highways/#:~:text=Luminar%20has%20previously%20said%20its,limited%20purposes%20like%20driver%20assistance)**.**"|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1642119|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/OljYRJkLy-ra1_eg6J6Y2FJT5EK6_susDpG9E4PFQd8.jpg|SPAC deal of the day: LUMINAR - GORES METROPOULOS MERGE|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4tiad/spac_deal_of_the_day_luminar_gores_metropoulos/|no_ads|0.0|||||{'1epmwrwlxm261': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '1epmwrwlxm261', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e229020b8999bae60e4e0d5c776b0e6785f0fd5', 'x': 108, 'y': 60}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39cc46a42d62012a14c789af4d00e49327125402', 'x': 216, 'y': 121}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a909de6eff11b176e6e59ee2a60da6a55ad8d04', 'x': 320, 'y': 179}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29770167f32859775fb962b128387e461064d0d7', 'x': 640, 'y': 358}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2126f96feceb9796ca9fe90880f45abf687c6fcf', 'x': 956, 'y': 536}, 'status': 'valid'}, '5bx2vlgdym261': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '5bx2vlgdym261', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=356834bf90d59c8f8225b3ad6fc14179ee0adc09', 'x': 108, 'y': 60}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=826a822f6d1ce8c082a804acd31991b6322619d5', 'x': 216, 'y': 121}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=038cb9c64768fe6afaf691cfe1756e7c0de6b333', 'x': 320, 'y': 179}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d9331e1c7db5809f603cc0b10da3de1991df6b5', 'x': 640, 'y': 359}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16d5769f3da85b8b7bdc4074a38b04348d8c7860', 'x': 954, 'y': 536}, 'status': 'valid'}, 's56qgylfxm261': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 's56qgylfxm261', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf05bdfde736225659839da47d364e0dd74b925d', 'x': 108, 'y': 60}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=274e7f079e11993cc8d9f3e4e4c897ca4b59aa5a', 'x': 216, 'y': 121}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=656a27001cd577d934658c42146bab7fbf329572', 'x': 320, 'y': 179}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7889439be5104cc1aa24d5aae23c03c31e8d8260', 'x': 640, 'y': 359}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e60ca72eda76e4b79edc07b46efc8ed47ca96e92', 'x': 957, 'y': 538}, 'status': 'valid'}}|78.0|140.0|||||||||2020-12-01|FORD

VALE, however, has been solidly rising every single day.  I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.  Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Positions: VALE 18c 03/2021"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1641057|public|confidence|self|VALE is the next EV Hype Train|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ns7b/vale_is_the_next_ev_hype_train/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-12-01|FORD

And no, I didn’t spoon feed you a play, enjoy choosing your own path.   Ford has more then 2x since March lows.  I believe that because EV has been so hot lately Ford has caught a bit of the tail winds as well as they are developing cars that are also EV.  I believe they are lookinig to create a Electric F150 (but correct me if I am wrong).  I wanted to show this chart as I think it is extremely interesting on a technical Level, but also presents a pretty decent setup.   1D: We can see that since Mid september Ford has gone on quite a run from the 6's all the way to the 9's up about 40% in this time. We can see that there is a major horizontal at 9.63 that was almots tapped last week.  I expect this area to act as huge resistance.  I am watching the 9.60 area because either way it will lead to a nice trade.  If F gets rejected here we possibly could see a pull back down into the 7 range, but a break of 9.60 could be the beginning of a new bull run.  So as I said either way I am watching.   1D Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5WsiPfk3/  On the Below 3D chart we can see that in 2018 - 2019 the 9.60 area was major support / resistance:   3D 2018 - 2019: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uAzjjNu1/  2011 - 2012 We can see the same thing.  The 9.60 area acting as major support  3D 2011-2012: https://www.tradingview.com/x/kKDOpBty/  2006-2007 Another couple of rejections at the 9.60 area  2006-2007 chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gz0jq2dG/  2002 Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/MUjLkmcw/  1995 Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QXxFyTq7/  1993 Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aI1PPiWt/  1987 - 1989 Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZVFx5R7Y/  This horizontal has been in play for over 33 years at this point which is pretty amazing to see.  The horizontal is older then majority of the people in MOT.  Horizontals that have been in play for so long tend to be way more important so a break or rejection of this area will likely be significant.  Overall I think its likely we see some sell pressure at 9.60, but when it does break I will be looking to buy with a decent sized position.   Thought this was pretty interesting and worth sharing.  This is why historical trends are so important.  Also Interesting is to look at Flow Algo's Levels.  10.09 has gotten the most Volume out of any of the levels.  So 9.60 could be the break, but then watch for 10.09 for confirmation.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1636232|public|confidence|self|Ford TA|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k47nve/ford_ta/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'R_biNGr78timCE08xleSwHQc1h3la8-zlp86QQPufJU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 76, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7744a358149f52fe57e69751ab393d7efd955fd', 'width': 108}, {'height': 152, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8d9b2b289cfd8bdca95c7a0e68c617d5628904', 'width': 216}, {'height': 225, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5210d1960a6141c459d9bcb3a8bcfb5457ae9d', 'width': 320}, {'height': 450, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7e913df56c07dd1e15691f47f5d5d68d419abbe', 'width': 640}, {'height': 675, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93e81b80aadb32c323664ca347f1f26e784c375a', 'width': 960}, {'height': 760, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e80bf96c6aaf70567d0c4cbc71bd71c9682b91d', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1818, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Eczb6o4-Jo8YKZHFosDYCeOfNPVT1qaFEUNOruAIja4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f9f71633ff1de5940eccfe822a9414c8d2768318', 'width': 2582}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-11-30|FORD

The real move right now is investing in hydrogen fuel cell companies. These companies manufacture hydrogen fuel cells which can be used for automobiles, and other engineering services.   &amp;#x200B;  With FCEL up 300% since last month and BLDP up 30% since last month, both stocks are a great way to gain exposure to this alternative renewable energy available for future automobiles. GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, and many other car manufactures are looking into this potential energy source...   Link to Toyota Mirai a hydrogen fuel cell powered automobile: [https://www.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html](https://www.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html)  Link to Honda Clarity a hydrogen fuel cell powered automobile: [https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell](https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell)   Even Germany is upgrading its public transportation to use these fuel cells: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/17/germany-launches-worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-train](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/17/germany-launches-worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-train)  &amp;#x200B;  I'm surprised that this isn't getting more discussion and even more news presence.  Hydrogen fuel cells have barely taken off, have much more room to moon, and are already accelerating upward at a fast pace. THESE STOCKS ARE UP ALMOST 350% COLLECTIVELY THE PAST MONTH AND CAN EASILY TRIPLE OR MORE AGAIN BY FEBRUARY !!!  &amp;#x200B;  I'm currently trading BLDP options with a jan 2022 exp and $20 strike which have doubled since I bought last month and also FCEL options with a jan 2022 exp and a $5.5 strike which have tripled since I purchased a few months ago.  JUST PURCHASED SHORTER TERM OPTIONS TODAY BASED ON THE GROWTH OUTLOOK AND INVESTMENT OF BIG BANKS JP AND CITI!  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR; HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS WILL PROVIDE MASSIVE TENDIES TO ALL! THIS MARKET IS NOT BEING REPORTED OR INVESTED IN AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE! IT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND LITTLE HYPE RIGHT NOW BUT IS STARTING TO GAIN STEAM. STOCKS COULD EASILY TRIPLE BY MARCH AND JP MORGAN AND CITI RECENTLY INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE SPACE!

I'm seeing price targets of $22, $25. I've been playing the EV SPACs for a hot minute and there's a few that are primed and ready to rip. No idea what Fisker will do, i just know it's up +100% since end of Oct and I don't see any reason why it's going to get above $26 by eoy. What I'm trying to say is you can do better, throw your dollars of fomo desperation at these US companies and double down on your autism.  I do hold positions in the following 3 SPACs below but only one offers options right now, the other 2 have warrants but you hoodies are SOL there (long stock positions should still be good gainers though). I've pored through shitload upon shitload of EV SPAC DD the past 2 weeks and I believe these 3 have a lot of upside in both the near and long terms. Please feel free to enlighten me on others and lend me your thoughts    Lightning eMotors (GIK) - Colorado based, these guys are fleet electrification similar to XL Fleet/PIC,  install electric powertrains into Ford and Chevy chassis and sell them along with charging station and infrastructure. They said in Oct that they doubled their storage, capacity, and employees to meet new and continuing order demand, and going public via Gigacapital3 Inc. These guys are currently valued at about $1B and have way more to show than some of these EV companies who literally haven't put out a damn thing, and their market cap is under $350 mil. Again they are producing now and will continue to grow, this should be an easy 3x bagger into June with exponential revenue growth hitting over $1B by 2024. They have warrants under GIK/WS exercising at $11.50.  Read more https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/lightning-emotors-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-gigcapital    Luminar (GMHI) - Orlando based lidar company, have deals with Daimler, Volvo, and now Mobileye (bought by Intel 2017). This merger to take these guys public will make lidar prodigy/Luminar founder the youngest billionaire in the US. I've seen valuations around $5-$7B for this guy so don't let Papa Elon scare you off from Lidar, it's going to be used broadly and Google is going after it too. Current market cap under $700k. Warrants are GMHIW and good for $11.50 after the merger and they have options  Read more https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/amp/    Microvast (T-H-C-B) I have high hopes for this one When these guys ink a deal it's going to steal the hype from Quantum Scape and probably immediately poise them as global top 5 EV battery mfrs. Valued at at least $2B, under $450M market cap, $100M revenue 2020. I think these guys are gonna be right there with Quantum Scape developing solid state lithium batteries.

Exro is a clean tech company that has developed a new class of controller that dynamically enables multiple power settings in a single motor making it faster, stronger, and smarter. Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology.  Exro combines its patented software and hardware with in-house design, development testing, and final assembly at its Calgary Innovation Center for the most cost-effective solutions.  Exro is putting the intelligence into energy management and seeks to accelerate the global transition to clean energy.  I will summarize what I know and what I have learned from my investigation  1. As per CEO, their Projections are: Revenue should start from end of 2021. EBITDA +ve from 2023 2. Business model -&gt; If its a low volume high value, they said they could manufacture themselves. If its volume business , they will either engage Contract manufacture it or do a licensing deal with OEMs who take care of manufacturing. Most business will be done in the license model 3. MOAT : They hold patents in different regions. They claim, each customer's work will be customized design for the customer and since their main work is software, they believe it will take years for someone to reverse engineer it. 4. Competitors - CEO claims no competition. The problem statement is widely known. My personal investigation till date suggest that there is/are other competitor(s) around, but they have their own solution. Question is, who has best efficiency &amp; range and can they start commercializing it soon.  There are many ways seen to solve the problem :  i) Motor companies who use expensive Permanent magnet motors (made of rare earth metals). These are expensive but performance is great  ii) Semiconductor technology: Silicon-Mobility a French private startup, are working on same problem. Their's solution is based on similar, software tech but this thro semiconductors...Exro is micro controller but directly on the motor. Silicon-Mobility claim is they can better performance &amp; torque by 10-30%. Exro is also same or more. Silicon-Mobility do have couple of good partners (Valeo a auto ancillary and AVL autotech company).But IMO, they are a bit behind in commercialisation, atleast from what I know. It will be one to watch out for in future...if they ever go public.  End of the day, the electrification and solving the Differential Torque problem in Electric Car wont be solved alone by 1 company for entire world.  Exro has sooooooo many use cases and opportunity size is huge.  Their current plan is to use these prototype partnerships and get the test benchmark data. Say suppose Potencia testing gives benchmark data for electric car (converted from ICE by Potencia) and a electric Van. The data they get out of this testing will then be used and benchmarked against commercially available electric car data. If Exro finds enough proof that their tech is better, then they can go to the bigger OEMs like GM or Ford or whoever and get seat at the table.  If Potencia works, then Exro's target IMO should be likes of GM &amp; Ford who want to do the volume business. They also have several partners listed on their site here: [https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/](https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/)  Finally, Haywood Securities covered them recently, and you can find the 20+ page report here, with a price target of $6.00 CAD.

Lemonade is worth 3.8b, which would be 300% from here. Here is Chamath's tweet about it:  Summary  * Insurance is an important enabler of economic growth and represents hundreds of billions of market cap.  * Pricing insurance is antiquated. Data is now proliferating in ways that should change pricing and risk.  * We need to move from a world of static, approxirnated rates for large groups of people to personalized dynamic rates for individuals based on their own behavior.  * Insurance startups are finding scale through online acquisition of customers, better risk-based pricing and more efficient servicing of its products.  * These inefficiencies of pricing and go to market are creating an innovator's dilemma for incumbents.   Qualitative   * One-third of drivers drive most of the miles and get in most of the accidents. Despite this, they pay the same rates as everyone else. As a result, two-thirds of drivers are overpaying for auto insurance.  * Metromile's personalized per-mile insurance fits better in a world where more people are switching to work-for-home, using ridesharing more often, and using autonomous vehicles - every mile is unique and insurance should adjust accordingly.  * Metromile makes dynamic per-mile insurance easy with multiple options for sharing data and capturing savings:     * Mobile app that provides savings insights before you signup and useful features after you signup.     * A dongle that you install in your car which measures your driving behavior and allows you to get cheaper insurance rates as it leams about your driving habits o OEM relationships with car manufacturers that allows you to send your real time driving data to Metromile (initially Ford but likely to increase to all OEMs as cars become Internet connected)  * Metromile's claims service is fully automated, reducing fraud, hassle and cost to consumers. • Metromile's business model allows it to grow in three powerful ways:      * B2C: sell insurance to people with best in class unit economics and efficient customer acquisition     * B2B2C: work with auto OEMs (ie Ford) to access telemetry APIs, get real-time driving data, price risk in real time, a. then upsell cheaper insurance to the car owner.     * B2B: license core risk engines to other insurance companies to improve their claims experience, reduce fraud, and improve operating margins, while getting paid on a per policy basis.  * Metromile saves customers more than any other insurer (-47%). As a result, CAC is lower, LTV is high.  * Unlike competitors (Root and Lemonade), Metromile has already achieved profitable unit economics - they do not need to raise rates to get profitable or figure out how to cross-sell other products to make money.   Quantitative   * Top level metrics:     * 47% savings vs competitors     * 15% contribution margins and growing     * $1,000+ annual premiums     * LTV:CAC of 2-3x and growing  * Competitive positioning  * Metromile one-year retention is best in class at 63%, Lemonade is 62%, Root is 33%  * Metromile loss ratio is best in class at 59% (YTD).

We’ll probably get news announcing it tomorrow or sometime later this week imo, before the holidays at the latest, AND it’s barely above $11 for the common and warrants are hella cheap as well. Volume has been way higher last week, I bet this runs up like Hylion or CIIC, it’s an EV SPAC after all.

The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all).   So what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025.   So Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.  Invest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!

GIK and Lightning eMotors are in “advanced talks” regarding a funding deal. See the excerpt below for funding info and what Lightning does:  “Lightning eMotors has raised about $28 million and was valued at about $47 million after a March funding led by BP Ventures, according to PitchBook Data. It said at that time it would use the funding to ramp up production to fulfill new orders for electric powertrains for Ford Transits, Ford E-450s, Ford F-59 step vans, Chevrolet Low Cab Forward 6500XD trucks and Lightning Electric city buses.  The company in October said it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, increased production and doubled its workforce.”  The wave on this guy hasn’t come close to starting with volume only picking up yesterday. Traded sideways all day until after hours where it went up ~3%. As stated LOI is expected to drop within the next two weeks. Could be the next CIIG.

Look at the dot com bubble it was sound logic to assume that the internet was going to evolve the world. It is sound logic to assume that evs will take over the car industry so does its current valuation justify its place in the future.    Toyota: 231B                                     Tesla: 465 B   Fiat Chrysler: 20 B   Ford: 24 B   Ferrari: 32 B   GM: 36 B   Honda: 46 B   Volkswagen: 74B   Total: 463 B                                     Total :465 B   I fully believe that tesla will be the top dog in the EV industry. But to justify this valuation you would have to believe tesla is gonna sell almost every new car in the next ten years. Telsa sells only a 318,000 to 10.7 m that Toyota sells.  Where are these sky high evaluations coming from if not for a bubble? This isnt even looking at other ev companies if we consider NKLA, NIO, Fisker, or solo. NKLA is the most damning that you dont even have to sell a single EV to get billions in valuation for a ev company. How does this not scream Dot com bubble to anyone? I can't wait for the new paradigm bs that is gonna appear in the comments.    @ 2 SQQQ Calls at 16 exp 1/21/2022|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1599758|public|confidence|self|Ev tech bubble featuring Tesla|0.0|[]|0.75|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxxaol/ev_tech_bubble_featuring_tesla/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-11-20|FORD

Tesla has the best battery technology, best cars, tons of other revenue sources, best scientists working for them, Elon Musk, the 2nd best self driving technology out there, and a huge headstart in the EV market around the world.  They are consistently smashing through records with their sales and revenue, and coming out with tons of new inventions to help revolutionize multiple industries.  They're not JUST cars, they have batteries, solar panels, Starlink, and so much more.  As of right now, they also have basically a monopoly on the NA EV market, and a massive lead in the Chinese EV market as well, and a top seller in the EU EV market as well.  Nio is none of this.  Nio was nearly bankrupt a year ago, and only survived because they managed to get a 1.4 billion dollar bailout.  As of right now, Nio has 1.5 billion dollars in short and long-term debt and lease operating liabilities.  Nio's trailing 12 months revenue has been 1.4 billion.  This is completely in line with most car companies.  Ford has 175 billion in debt and 156 billion in yearly revenue.  GM's ratio is slightly better than both with 120 Billion-ish in revenue and 96 billion in debt.  GM and Tesla will be the main comparison here, because GM is massive, and Tesla is the direct competitor.    Tesla has 14billion in debt and 25 billion in revenue.  Which is much better than most, and their typically fund this by selling their disgustingly overvalued stock, which, ultimately helps them out a ton in the long run, as its essentially free money and people buy the dip literally everytime.  It should also be noted, even though Nio has more debt than it does revenue over 12 months, its also has never broken a profit.  It still consistently losses tons of money.  They have tons of debt, and still are losing TONS of money.  They also don't have any of the amazing things going for them like Tesla. They sell cars, they are a car company.  Nio has DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH TESLA.  Tesla is IN CHINA.  There's also plenty of options to buy electric cars in China right now as well.   Nio is NOT in America.  You cannot go to a Nio dealership and buy one in America.  Nio has barely any revenue, in a brutal and oversaturated market, tons of debt, nearly went bankrupt, and MORE THAN LIKELY WILL EVENTUALLY GO BANKRUPT AGAIN, they're losing tons of money, and not only competing with all of the major car companies in China, BUT THEYRE ALSO COMPETING WITH TESLA, DIRECTLY.  Nio also currently has 2 vehicles for sale..both of which are SUV's costing 70k+.  Sure, they MIGHT pull a Tesla, but odds are, they wont.  And even if they happen to start showing massive growth, THERE IS NO MORE ROOM FOR IT TO GROW IN STOCK PRICE.  They are worth more than GM, and worth 1/5th of tesla despite having 1/25th their revenue, a MUCH worse debt to revenue ratio, TESLA MAKES PROFIT QUITE OFTEN, and Tesla has alot of other potentially MASSIVE catalysts.  Tesla is struggling for world dominance.  Nio is struggling to not go bankrupt.  Nio is worth more than GM despite GM making 3 billion PROFIT a year.  Nio losses tens of millions of dollars a year, and has 1/120th their revenue and they are bigger than GM.  I am 100% certain Nio will not get anywhere close to GM.  Tesla, will eventually become on par with all of them, HENCE THEIR MASSIVE VALUATION.  Nio isn't the Tesla of China because TESLA IS THE TESLA OF CHINA.  The best-case scenario for Nio, is another year of large growth, a peak, then constant decline due to tons of competition and they get bought out by a large car company trying to get their way into China.  Most likely, given their insane valuation, is they're gonna have lots of hit and miss quarters, as more competitors flood the market, Nio will eventually no longer be able to stay in business because every major car maker in the world plans to have an electric car or 3 next year, and Nio will not have made it in time to have a massive market cap.

Slowly  Had some SPY puts this week so we’re taking our tour of the wreckage around Boomerland in a [Lamborghini Miura P400](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Lamborghini_miura_coup%C3%A9_1967_-aa.jpg/1200px-Lamborghini_miura_coup%C3%A9_1967_-aa.jpg). Tuck them sacks and buckle them balls because I don’t know how to drive a stick.   GE beat earnings expectations and actually *made* money ($0.06 EPS vs expected -$0.04). Not many saw that coming so the inhabitants of Boomerland popped a few Viagras and started humping the buy button until it shot up on a swing of more than +9% early Wednesday morning from -4.76% to +4.42% before giving up all the week’s gains in the last two hours of trading. Popped back up in time for open on Thursday but promptly got tired and fell asleep. Finished the week down -0.7%.   XOMMY XOMMY XOM XOM. In a remarkably rational footnote to this confounding covid market, the ground-pounding for a company that relies on things and people being moved. Down -3.5% on the week and a staggering -21% on the 3-month chart.   What’s the mpg on my Lambo, you ask? 14.9 mpg thank you very much; not bad for the era.  IBM, which did a *very* IBM-like thing on the 19th and hit ER expectations on the nose at $2.58 EPS, had an interesting week. International Business Machines’ stock price melted to a low of -7.26% on Wednesday before making a steady climb back up to just -2.4% on the week. Solid showing on Friday; +2.6% on the day.   UL, the world’s favorite Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, positively shat the bed this week with a loose, bloody stool. For a company that’s been pretty damn rangebound, this week’s -6.24% slide is a stark reminder to hide both your bonds and your dividends because they’re raping everybody.   Likewise, KO - champions in antiquity of liquid-induced diabetes, also had an unfortunate and smelly accident in the marketplace this week. Down -4.20% on the week to $48.07 per share. Ouch. It took *forever* to get to $50 and fought its balls off to stay above that. Not a good look.  This is getting depressing so let’s do an uplifting one. How about BA? They’re always good for a laugh. Ah, yes; they appear to have died. Down to -12.2% on the week. Whoops.  Could the banking industry perhaps pull us out of this dreadful malaise? Fuck no; sector down 3-4%ish.  HON (Honeywell)? They beat expectations! Down 4.76% on the week.   Ford? Red.  GM? Red.  PFE. Surely the company on whose shoulders rest the entire world’s hope for a return to normalcy can provide us with a dose of the green stuff. Down -6.8% on the week. Bwoooooooah fuck that’s PFE we’re talking about here.  Very fucking depressing.   Welp, I guess that’s all for this this week’s tour of Boomerland for the week ending October 30th, 2020.

With $F earnings around the corner their stock can easily run up near $10+ and with options being cheap you guys can drown on FD’s and blow your money the smart way. Second quarter analyst thought Ford was going to lose $5 billion but only lost $2 billion about .35 a share and that’s because of the factory shut downs cause of Covid. Ford ended up with $39 billion cash in hand the second quarter so they have money to invest for the future i.e. EV companies if you guys have been following Ford news you already know they invested $500 million into the EV company Rivian and are looking to work with Volkswagen and other companies this push to invest into the futures comes with changes to their executives in October 1st Jim Farley was named the new Ceo of Ford and he’s already making changes to the key roles of some executives.

Papa Elon is bringing a market revolution with his vehicles. He has finally proved he can continue to grow production and manage costs.   That being said, we still live in the ICE age. That shit isn't going to melt for another decade. Let's talk about Covid and market trends. People aren't using public transportation. The housing market is still stable. GM just got upgraded. People are buying more cars than they have in a while. A rising tide lifts all boats.  Jim Hackett has been CEO of F and sucked. Ford is burdened with debt like my wife's boyfriend had a breeding fetish and knocked her up. Ford's stock has been beaten down greatly. But that is why it is such a great buy right now where Ford has finally started to turn things around by focusing on the F150. The F150 is the only reason they are still around today.  By focusing on their only decent product and switching leadership they can get back to the level of mediocrity we all expect.   Look at the stock technicals. The stock finally had its golden cross this year. Other than that it has been pretty mediocre with no amazing news. This puts it in a position where there is plenty of upside. I think the slow upward trend will change with their next earnings call. People are overly hyped on electric. With the Mustang Mach-E on the way and an earnings beat, you're gonna see a sizeable bump.  I'm dumping my stock and calls pretty much after earnings. The company will end up in the dumpster after this final flame.  Do I think this is definitely right? No but I like to gamble and this is one of the best opportunities I've been able to find after SNAP. Just sold my 2 27.5c 11/27 this morning for a 5x gain. I thought I should post about that but didn't so this is my due diligence for any retards who want to gamble.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1564577|public|confidence|self|The case for F trade then watch it die.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfpo9s/the_case_for_f_trade_then_watch_it_die/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-10-22|FORD

Ford, GMC/Hummer, Atlis are showing trucks. This expands much deeper into markets as you are seeing regular sized trucks that have towing capacities of 35K lbs, 500 mile range and alleged super fast charge times (TBD).   So the question... who, how, and where are making these batteries?

What is Cerence you might be asking as your eyes have not been able to see anything but $GME or $AMD for the past few weeks because you are all degenerate fucktards who are alive for the sole purpose of losing money.   Cerence are the market leaders in AI and voice technology which is utilised within Automobile industry. They have been established and operating for more than 20+ years and their technology is currently used in 325M+ Cars already. They are partners with some of the biggest automobiles companies such as BMW, JAGUAR, FORD, GMC ETC.    Cerence have recently teamed up with NIO on voice recognition and I envisage this trend unfolding against ALL EV manufacturers to provide the smart and next generation Technology for safety and Entertainment purposes.   This is just the tip of the iceberg, they have recently began to venture in to Non-Automobile industries and have landed some big fucking contracts.   The company is already performing very well and within the coming months and years they will be the market leaders in AI technology with their stock price estimated to match and then grow larger than the biggest competitors (NVDA, TSLA)   This is a potential 10 bagger and in the coming months and years this is going to be astronomical.

Slowly.  I have to get to the course for my tee time so this week we’re going to punch it through Boomerland in an [AMC Gremlin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Gremlin_side_%285903000893%29.jpg/1200px-Gremlin_side_%285903000893%29.jpg) so that I can get there on time. Fuck you, AMC had sexy cars including the [Matador](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/1972_AMC_Matador.jpg/280px-1972_AMC_Matador.jpg) and the [Pacer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/AMC_Pacer_1975_French_advertisement.jpg/220px-AMC_Pacer_1975_French_advertisement.jpg) (*that* is how you sell a car, folks).   Let’s just look at all companies’ performance on Monday: fuuuuuuuuuuuuck that’s green. Right. Now on to the rest of the week.   Psyche. This is Boomerland and youthful exuberance is rarely tolerated here.  Let’s circle back to IBM, who sells International Business Machines but did not get the memo that Monday was supposed to be green. Tuesday was ugly. Wednesday was nice. Thursday was *not*. Had a good Friday to close out the week -1.7% to 125.93. Side note: you may remember that IBM spiked in early February at over $156/share. Only about 24% more to go.   GE, who sells General Electrics, also failed to have a green Monday (see, *this* is why Boomerland is special) and muddled through the week only to become the hottest fucking stock on everyone’s mind starting late Thursday and rising 7% to close out the week +5.5%.  Why? Because the Boeing 737 Max could fly again this year. Yep, that’s right - the stock rose 7% because they are a supplier for a company who delivered 11 planes in September, had no new orders, and released an apocalyptic industry forecast last week but got encouraging news from the FAA on their most scandalous plane. Jebus, that was a long sentence. Let’s just say this: makes total sense and there’s nothing to see here.  Let’s just slide right into BA, who *also* did not have a green Monday. BA touched a low of -4.8% on the week at open on Thursday but quickly rose back to green for the day before taking off overnight (pun fully intended so suck my Gremlin) to reach soaring heights of +2.75% for the week at open on Friday. Somewhat of a sensor issue shortly after takeoff and rolled into the weekend -0.2% for the week to 167.35.   Let’s find a company that *did* get to participate in Monday’s extravaganza. Coca-Cola ($KO) got above $51/share on Monday but then Tuesday happened. And Wednesday. And Thursday. But Friday was at least flatish. Down -1.8% for the week to close out at $49.94/share.  HON (Honeywell). A lot of action happened between pre-market Monday and close on Friday. Very little of that actually mattered. Closed the week +0.1%. It’s like the new person in The Villages - still has a lot of spunk but just wants to fit in with its slower friends at the Dow. (Just like KO, I have a raging conflict of interest here and I don’t think that tucking it into my waistband is going to help.)  HSBC. It’s one week chart just looks like one long groan punctuated by a hiccup. Had a stellar Monday for +0.02% and then proceeded to dump. Bottomed out at -5.7% for the week on Thursday morning and recovered a bit to close out the week -2.6%. Why? Who knows, maybe investors think all this talk of legalizing weed in Mexico is bad for their business.   I’m definitely going to be late for my tee time. One more.  F (Ford) snazzy af on Monday flirting with +6% near open but proceeded give most of that up by Thursday morning. Investors saw the words “China” and “good” in the company’s sales report released Thursday and gave themselves CTE as they bashed their heads against the buy button as fast as they could. Closed out the week +4%.   Hope you enjoyed our tour through Boomerland for the week ending October 16th, 2020.

Crazy cheap calls trading below their high from just yesterday.   Ford jumped on “good news” of a Buy rating this week and slumped on news that some vehicles are delayed to next year, but there’s two days left in the week, and if it goes up a bit then people more desperate than us will drive the call price up.   Think about the news possibilities: there are two separate nationally televised events with presidential candidates who will undoubtedly talk about the economy. Trump will likely say something about how he’s creating huge growth and markets will love it because nothing makes sense anymore. Biden will talk about how he saved the auto industry and will do it again.   Cheap calls so low downside and random potential for monies.

They bought AK Steel holdings, known for owning the old Steelmaking half of Ford's Dearborn assembly, and ArcelorMittal USA, a large producer of cold-rolled steel.  These facts will be relevant later on.  Orange man did the wrong thing when he banged his cheeseborger about steel and steel workers.  It's not the mill workers that need protection, it's the downstream customer.  CLF knows this.  Traditionally they're an iron miner.  An iron miner with a 3.3% Dividend at a current price of 7.28 has now become the US's largest manufacturer of cold-rolled steel, passing Nucor.  You may think this is simple vertical integration, but this is a future-looking play.    Those of you in the know in the automotive business know that in the race for fuel economy, cars have gotten lighter.  Steel/cast iron was replaced with aluminum, and steel companies hurt as a result of it.  Hell, Alcoa split into two companies just to support automotive aluminum production.  Aluminum is more expensive than steel because it's more energy-focused to produce.  But Elon Musk famously said ""We're making our starships out of stainless steel, it's cheaper"" and then unveiled the Cybertruck.  Which is made from (as the unveiling showed) Cold Rolled Stainless steel.  Once the trucks are being made (as the Austin plant is built and ultimately finished) the market for steel price will start to rise from its lows as consumption increases.  Let's also talk about Ford Dearborn for a second.  Anyone who's been slammed face first with the ass end of a ford TV commercial in the last 10 years knows that the F-series now runs with an Aluminum body.  But given the choice of cheaper steel or continuing to buy aluminum, Ford will probably retool again to make steel trucks.  Know why?  [Dearborn plant is currently undergoing an expansion and additional tooling to make electric F150s.](https://www.enr.com/articles/50103-ford-begins-construction-on-700-million-rouge-center-expansion-to-add-electric-f-150-production-line)  Also, battery packs have to be strong to avoid puncture, which makes it all the more likely that they will need steel from a local supplier to support it.  Steel market goes up due to increased consumption.  This is a long term play but i'm going long for it.  Orange Tariff man won't save the American steel industry, it will be Elon Musk and the Electric Car Revolution."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1552457|public|confidence|self|So, Cleveland-Cliffs goes out and buys out two major steel producers and not one DD in here?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jaubra/so_clevelandcliffs_goes_out_and_buys_out_two/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'nLf-LvG4u91YoOVVFac3OziCwLzNngET2yhP-fALagw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 57, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7HO433HgOcsxIHdyAQKVvXYk72YtaGAkOjL_eX6_hAs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76a189b42d432e9540bc8d5de97a82a7e5148365', 'width': 108}, {'height': 114, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7HO433HgOcsxIHdyAQKVvXYk72YtaGAkOjL_eX6_hAs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc91292e50c68ec0df5b46ac4b3c9cef063166e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7HO433HgOcsxIHdyAQKVvXYk72YtaGAkOjL_eX6_hAs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=154d733ebcf084edeb4d65cebbfec254ac7a9683', 'width': 320}, {'height': 337, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7HO433HgOcsxIHdyAQKVvXYk72YtaGAkOjL_eX6_hAs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6638a150fb269495dee58dbcddc70c81669a21cf', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 475, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7HO433HgOcsxIHdyAQKVvXYk72YtaGAkOjL_eX6_hAs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1bd931d989eca662ab7525cb0629e5285e4f6a81', 'width': 900}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-10-14|FORD

In about a week, the company will report how many electric cars it delivered in the third quarter.  [September](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-this-is-not-a-september-to-remember-51600948475) has been a lousy month for Tesla (ticker: TSLA). Shares fell 22%, as of Thursday’s closing price, as a widely anticipated update on the company’s battery technology failed to wow investors. The decline is worse than Tesla’s 21% drop in March when the entire market was plummeting because of the coronavirus.  It might have been impossible for any company to [live up to the expectations](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-day-cost-savings-increased-production-51600818909) for Battery Day. Tesla shares rose 74% in August, partly in anticipation.  Wall Street’s analysis of the event fell along [party lines](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-falls-battery-day-what-wall-street-is-saying-technology-51600866911). Bearish analysts wrote that the event was too full of aspirations and light on news that will affect shares in the near term. Bullish analysts wrote that Tesla’s lead in battery technology was accelerating and that the day gave them more confidence the company would be delivering millions of vehicles annually in a few years.   That event is now in the rearview mirror and third-quarter deliveries—a proxy for sales—are the next thing to watch. Shares rallied more than 13% in early July after second-quarter delivery numbers [blew by](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-deliveries-were-incredible-the-stock-is-flying-51593692989) Wall Street expectations that had been dragged lower by concern over how much the pandemic would [hurt production.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-fremont-factory-reopening-coronavirus-deliveries-earnings-51589808002)  The strong number raised hope that Tesla would report a profit in the second quarter—a prerequisite for the company being included in the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/SPX) index. That, in turn, could have brought more gains because funds that track the S&amp;P 500 would have had to buy the stock.  (Tesla produced the required profit and still [wasn’t added](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-didnt-join-the-s-p-500-but-three-others-did-51599255574).)  Less drama is attached to the third-quarter numbers than came with prior [delivery releases](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q2-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries). Both of Telsa’s factories—in California and China—are open. What’s more, analysts expect profitability will be easier to achieve than in the second quarter, tamping down the impact of any S&amp;P 500 index-related surprises.  Wall Streets expects the company will deliver about 141,000 cars during the third quarter. Estimates range from 123,000 to 161,000.  Until recently, FactSet—an aggregator of Wall Street forecasts—listed an estimate of 190,000 vehicles as one of the figures used to produce its consensus numbers. That was skewing the average a little, but the estimate vanished this week. Removing the 190,000 figure dropped the average estimate by about 3,000 vehicles.  The current quarter is expected to be a record for Tesla by a wide margin. The company delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019—the current record—before the pandemic hit.  Analysts expect the company to deliver about [483,000 cars](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-owns-the-u-s-electric-vehicle-market-analyst-says-why-it-will-own-china-and-europe-too-51590761583) in 2020, up from 368,000 in 2019. That’s an impressive feat given the global economic recession. [Ford Motor](https://www.barrons.com/quote/F) (F), for instance, is expected to sell about 4.2 million vehicles in 2020, down from 5.4 million in 2019.  The relative performance is reflected in stock prices. Ford shares are down 28% year to date, worse than comparable returns of the S&amp;P 500 and [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/DJIA).

Nelson, who covers Tesla for CFRA and has been critical of the stock’s valuation in the past — thinks a President Biden could unlock further earnings power for the EV maker.  Nelson adds, “For example, talking about building out the number of EV charging stations in the U.S. which currently stands at about 27,000. Biden wants to increase that by a half a million. So that would be a 20-fold increase in the number of EV charging station in the U.S. which would help Tesla tremendously. Biden also wants to increase both tax credits and tax breaks to really stimulate both the production and sale of electric vehicles, which we think Tesla would benefit from as the only electric vehicle maker.”  To Nelson’s point, Biden’s EV proposals cut across three different lanes as a means to stimulate demand. All three would not only be good news for the bottom line of Tesla, but to General Motors, Ford, Toyota that are all racing to get EVs to market within the next five years. Even Amazon through its investment in electric truck maker Rivian could see a Biden boost.  First, Biden would offer rebates for consumers to swap out older, less fuel efficient cars for electric vehicles manufactured in the United States. The plan mirrors the Obama era administration’s ‘Cash for Clunkers’ scheme that came at the height of the Great Recession in 2009.  Meantime, Biden would like to upgrade the government’s fleet of autos to electric vehicles. At the moment, the government uses a wide range of suppliers for its various autos — from GM for the president’s Cadillac to Ford pickup trucks for border patrol. One would have to think Tesla and its all-American production story stands to play in any government car upgrade.  And then lastly is Biden’s plan to add a half million new charging stations. That would go a long way to reducing the range of anxiety inherent to many drivers fearful of switching from gas-powered cars.  Maybe Tesla CEO Elon Musk wasn’t so crazy at ‘Battery Day’ when saying he would like to produce 20 million cars a year (up from 500,000 or so today).

He will remain as one of the company’s largest shareholders, but will not have a say in how the company is managed going forward. Sources tell FreightWaves that the decision was Milton’s, in an effort to protect the company and his investment. Milton owns approximately 82 million shares or 20% of the company, worth about $2.8 billion dollars.  Milton is the founder of Nikola Motors, creating a vision for a hydrogen powered trucking industry. His comments about the capabilities of Nikola and the hydrogen powered trucking network he planned to build have occasionally stretched beyond what is physically possible, leaving many detractors to highlight these statements as proof that the company is a scam.  Others, including many in the industry and suppliers that partnered with the company, saw a firm with a grand vision and opportunity to make a major impact on the future of the transportation industry. If successful, Nikola could have a huge impact on the carbon footprint of one of the world’s largest source of emissions.  Before the company went public, few had heard of the company outside of the heavy-duty trucking industry. The company completed a reverse merger IPO or SPAC offering in June, which gave the company a valuation higher than Ford. The company has yet to mass produce a product and all of it’s revenue to date came from selling solar panel installation services to Milton.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1510754|public|confidence|self|"""Trevor Milton has resigned as Executive Chairman of Nikola Motors (NASDAQ: NKLA)”"|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iwswmb/trevor_milton_has_resigned_as_executive_chairman/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-09-21|FORD

I started trading back around late may/ early June of this year. I’m 19 and I wanted a way to make a little bit of passive income. I threw $100 into Webull and started trading. Over the next month I would lose over $700. I kept throwing more and more money in my account after every loss. I know now that 20% on one trade is really good, but when 20% is only $40 or so, I don’t see it as big money. I’d make a couple trades that hit that sweet 100%+ mark and got addicted to chasing that high again, which always resulted in me diamond hands-ing into a substantial loss. Come mid July I decided to open a Robin Hood account.  My Robinhood play through started out incredibly well actually. Options went up a lot quicker than just regular trading (especially when ford drops the Bronco). After my first three days I’d already tripled my initial $50 deposit. But once again my greed came back to haunt me. Instead of being happy with a 200% week I decided to keep trading FD’s late into the week, which is when I “learned” about theta and IV. This process continued for another month: make it big early in the week, get greedy and blow my account back down. I got back into my old habit of funding whenever I got “too low” but the big kicker came when my RH account became restricted. Not being able to sell same day fucked me over, but I kept trading on RH until I decided to go back to Webull (not before losing another couple hundred dollars). (I’d also like to note that I was now trading options on Webull)  Last Monday I sat with about $150 in my account. I told myself that I was done being greedy and I was going to start settling for 20% profit. By Friday I was left $47. Monday I bought a $535 Tesla call for $36, anticipating a run up for battery day next week. I could’ve sold my call for $350+ on Tuesday, but I went full retard and told myself that it was gonna run all week and I’d get a $2,000 payout. Today my account has $2.98.   I honestly feel like I’m a moron, I have no idea why I just can’t sell when I’m up.  If I would’ve just taken my profit every time I honestly think I’d have at least 5k in my account, I don’t make terrible trades I just hold for too long. I’ve lost track of how much money I’ve lost but I know it’s in the $1,000-1,400 range. Which doesn’t sound like a lot compared to most of the loss porn on here, but that’s a lot for a college kid who is only working once every 2 weeks since school has started back up.   I cried twice out of frustration this morning, which wasn’t all because of stonks, but 50% of it was because it’s just been accumulating in my head all summer.  If you read this whole thing, thank you. I just really needed to get all of this off my chest, I figured I’d come here since there’s a lot of people who can relate to my situation.   Since I’m barely working I can’t really afford to fund an account any longer and I don’t really know what to do. I guess I’ll just be out of the game for awhile. If anyone has any advice please shove it down my throat (no homo), if you don’t have any advice and just wanna call me a retard after reading this feel free to that as well.  Once again apologies if this is a mess, I kinda just poured out what’s been going through my mind all week.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1504708|public|confidence|self|Account blown, just needed a place to vent.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivh51v/account_blown_just_needed_a_place_to_vent/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-09-18|FORD

The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time.   https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/  **Apple**  Back in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple’s stock shouldn’t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. “The idea that you’re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,” he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html  Look at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.   **Intel**  I'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader’s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.   **Data Centric Transformation**  Intel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.  https://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/  https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951  **Self driving business**  Intel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.  The firm’s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye’s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel’s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.  https://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/  https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019  https://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/  https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951  https://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html   **PC Business**  This is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel’s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm’s Intel Xe GPU.  Intel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021.   https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/ https://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/   **7 nm/10 nm process**  Since I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel’s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.  I agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.  https://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/ https://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html   **Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** :   I'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1470889|public|confidence|self|Intel : the big picture and why I'm bullish on it|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/inrj01/intel_the_big_picture_and_why_im_bullish_on_it/|no_ads|0.0||dark|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'm4bYb6Db8Zay2VUnTW0NAGqCLzOR_URvfzukwk7LtfY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 86, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pI1K1V4clKXtfmikssrHDy18tJ6T9Varw4WzAtfaqyA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68c2e0dceab763f66ea764777a65a142bff88023', 'width': 108}, {'height': 173, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pI1K1V4clKXtfmikssrHDy18tJ6T9Varw4WzAtfaqyA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4951302785a8a147df34109466d3a7e3612cf2d6', 'width': 216}, {'height': 256, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pI1K1V4clKXtfmikssrHDy18tJ6T9Varw4WzAtfaqyA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a306dbd5e1981fb51c85f3e32befbda97408c08d', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 400, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pI1K1V4clKXtfmikssrHDy18tJ6T9Varw4WzAtfaqyA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9339e0897ce74a223e8500909942750b7c86bf32', 'width': 499}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-09-06|FORD

The announcement will be coming in 1-3 weeks, with current upside potential being a solid swing play, or long hold.**  **Who is Worksport?**  Worksport (WKSP) is a Toronto based company that manufactures high quality, cost-effective tonneau covers for truck beds. It is the revenue-generating subsidiary of Franchise Holdings International and holds the patent to the TerraVis System which is the solar-power tonneau cover for truck beds.  Source: [Worksport Website](https://worksport.com/us/)  **Well, what is a tonneau cover and why is it important?**  Tonneau covers are the #1 accessory purchased for pickup trucks. As of 2019, Pickup trucks are the #1 selling automotive in the United States making up 19% of all vehicle sales in 2019. There are currently 56 million pickup trucks on the road with roughly 15 million new trucks are sold annually. 80% of all pickup trucks have after-market tonneau covers.

Worksport also owns IP/patents on the plastic molds, aluminum dies, processes, and associated tools in building their tonneau systems.  They are also currently the only company that offers a B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to customer) focused on the light truck market and offering solar-power generating tonneau cover. Their main competition, Truck Hero, makes up a large part of the market sector but does not offer a competitor to the TerraVis system.  **What’s so important about the TerraVis system?**  The TerraVis System is currently the only after-market vehicle accessory that generates, stores, and transfers solar-power to the vehicle or external batteries. Worksport holds the patent for the solar-tonneau system and is currently filing sub-patents for various components of the system.  Here are two videos of the system:  [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9JP8t8jvw)  [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lInSYqxM2gY&amp;t=1s)  **What’s the hype?**  Worksport announced they have entered into a $70 million OEM agreement with a U.S. based EV truck manufacturer to deliver their TerraVis system, with the likelihood of additional revenue moving forward. An official statement from the U.S. based EV Truck manufacturer on their purchase of the TerraVis tonneaus will be coming in mid-September.

(Buy the Rumor, Sell the News)**  There are currently three rumors on who Worksport is contracted with.  Rumor 1: Rivian (Amazon backed-company)  The CEO of Worksport, Steven Rossi has previously corresponded with Rivian’s founder RJ Scaring and Worksport’s parent company FNHI has posted several articles praising the company in what would seem like a mutually beneficial partnership.  Source: [https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/](https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/)  Rumor 2: Tesla  Elon Musk was quoted in late August stating that a solar-panel system on the Cybertruck would generate roughly 15 miles of range per day. This is an almost identical amount to what the TerraVis would provide. Additionally (and probably more compelling), Tesla will be holding it’s acclaimed “Battery Day” on September 22nd, directly in the window of when the partnership should be announced.

Source: [https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1301843534018945024](https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1301843534018945024)  Although these three are the strongest RUMORS, there are an array of other EV manufacturers that would still provide a huge upside for Worksport (Ford, GM, Lordstown, Nikola, etc.)  **Why buy now?**  CEO of Worksport tweeted this weekend to “be on the lookout” for another Tuesday announcement. So this upside play could happen quicker than expected.

Slowly*  What a week, gentlepeople. Strap in your ballsacks and let’s go for a ride through Boomerland because while your SoftBank-engineered tech implosion was bringing max pain to your asshoe, Boomer stocks where doing some shit too.  KO decided this was the week to finally break 50 and on Monday morning it did just that. After reaching about 50.01, it promptly changed its mind and ended Tuesday -1.5%. They must’ve found a bottle of the hallowed “old recipe” with the good stuff on Wednesday morning because it suddenly got high af for the rest of week, staunchly floating above 50 to close out +2.5% for the week.    GE took a wild ride opening up the week at euphoric heights of 6.64 before collapsing to 6.18 late on Tuesday. Then it basically forgot what just happened and did it again. All in a all, a lot of excitement to end the week -1.4%. Not exactly the Boomer route but definitely the Boomer destination.    BA, in a throwback to it’s days as a frat star must’ve gone ham this weekend and passed out until Thursday morning, whereupon it decided to gain 3.13% in about 15 minutes and then just fucking puked up everything in a 48 hour swing of 8% down to -5.26% for the week by Friday morning. It recovered its composure somewhat during market hours on Friday and ended up -2% for the week.   Ford. Basically 6.95 to 6.80 all fucking week with a random spasm up to 7.08 at open on Thursday. Ended the week -0.14%. If you know someone who had to watch Ford’s candles this week, send them a nice giftbasket with cocaine and hookers - try to make them feel alive again.   M, reputable clothier of no one anymore, Macy’s much anticipated earnings report smashed expectations by only *losing* $0.81 per share. Investor’s were so optimistic that they lost less money than expected that this liver-spotted former beauty queen closed the week +10.23%.   CSCO gave call holders reason to be optimistic by reclaiming $42.50 before once again saying, “fuck that noise”, hopping into a tire, and rolling down the nearest ravine to end the week -2.64%.    Banks are a thing and their stocks did some pretty wild shit this week (as far as banks go). They ended the week staunchly positive ~1.5%.    That’s all for this week’s tour through Boomerland. It was spooky af.

Yesterday they had a market cap at 460 billion fucking dollars.  Ford floats around 25Bil Honda floats around 45Bil. GM also floats around 45Bil Kia 12Bil Ferrari 35B Toyota floats around 175Bil because it's an incredibly efficient automaker with much larger margins than any competitors. I.e. the fucking opposite of Tesla.  I know we're all too busy collectively jerking off to hot pictures of TSLA gains but if you all took your hands off your dicks for two seconds, you might see TSLA could literally tank 75% and *still* be one of the highest valued auto manufacturers in the world.  I can already hear you mouth breathers beginning to spit out ""bu-bu-bu-Batteries"" and ""ItS mOrE tHaN aN AuTo MaNuFaCtUrEr"" but stop right there, dickweed.  It was only 6 months ago that every single investment analyst and their wives boyfriends were going on and on about how TSLA is an unsustainable business model that makes promises that can't be kept, continually missed target revenue, and had massive problems with safety on their production lines. Back then, $400 pre split was too high. That's $80 now for those of you that can't fucking count.  So lets go with a great case, never-gonna-happen scenario. Lets go with a *super fucking lenient* valuation of 150Bil. That's 62% lower than today's close, and a share price of $158. Still ~50% higher than valuations 6 months ago.  Shittier scenario? The the MM shit their pants and it moves closer to mainstream auto competitors. 75Bil valuation brings is 82% drop from today's close, share price of $73. And it's *still* worth Ford and Honda combined.  The bears got a taste with that 10% today. They're thirsty. You know what they say about bears; once they taste blood, they get really fucking gay.

Many shareholders are against the plan and this is a speculative play that the plan may be modified (bettered) or an alternative arrangement is possible, to which the share price would experience extreme upside or much greater. Details below.***  &amp;#x200B;  After looking through the Company’s financial statements, especially the recent ones published on [SEDAR.COM](https://SEDAR.COM) or direct from their website, you will ask yourself why this stock is trading at such a low market capitalization relative to its balance sheet and operations. Backstory below.  \---  In their own words, iAnthus Capital Holdings (“IAN”), Inc. owns, operates, and partners with best-in-class regulated cannabis operations across the United States. More information direct from their website: [https://www.ianthus.com/about](https://www.ianthus.com/about).  Hadley Ford \[interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=4gcBuaByjSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=4gcBuaByjSU)\], the CEO up until recently, had a background in banking being a former banker with Goldman Sachs, ran the Company alongside Elizabeth Stavola \[recent article: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathercabot/2020/08/05/pot-pioneer-elizabeth-stavola-resigns-from-firm-she-helped-build/#6e9019c55022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathercabot/2020/08/05/pot-pioneer-elizabeth-stavola-resigns-from-firm-she-helped-build/#6e9019c55022)\], former founder of MPX (which was acquired by IAN). Both have now resigned from IAN. More on this below.  Current interim CEO, Randy Maslow \[bio: [https://www.ianthus.com/team/management-team](https://www.ianthus.com/team/management-team)\], runs the show in Hadley’s stead. This becomes relevant later.  Prior to September 30, the Company sought additional financing through convertible debt in a concerted effort to raise a total of at least $100M to achieve their goal in accumulating a war chest for continued expansion in the US market. On September 30, 2019, the Company announced that they had secured additional financing to the tune of $20M (out of the $100M goal) to continue to expand operations – this specific instance Gotham Green Partners (“GGP”) had provided the financing. $50M was previously raised through GGP’s co-investor, a little-known lender that call themselves Torian Capital (total raised at this point was $70M).  \[Press release on the $50M financing: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/129/ianthus-announces-us50-million-senior-secured-debt](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/129/ianthus-announces-us50-million-senior-secured-debt)\]  \[Press release on the $20M financing: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/136/ianthus-announces-100-million-financing-plan-to-fully](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/136/ianthus-announces-100-million-financing-plan-to-fully)\]  On December 20, 2019, a third tranche came in, sourced from GGP to the tune of just over $36M \[source: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/149/ianthus-closes-on-36-million-senior-secured-convertible](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/149/ianthus-closes-on-36-million-senior-secured-convertible)\]. The Company has now raised just over $106M (50+20+36) between Torian and GGP.  \---  Keep in mind, 100% of the financing above were raised through a secured convertible debt instrument, already predatory in nature. See here for example discussion: [https://thedeepdive.ca/vanishing-vultures-are-ianthus-harvest-and-tilts-debt-deals-a-predatory-trap-or-a-false-bottom/](https://thedeepdive.ca/vanishing-vultures-are-ianthus-harvest-and-tilts-debt-deals-a-predatory-trap-or-a-false-bottom/). As you will see, it turns out to be indeed a predatory trap, but a potential opportunity for degenerates like us now.  \---  Back to IAN, and looking at their audited December 31, 2019 year-ended financial statements (available through their website or [SEDAR.COM](https://SEDAR.COM)), they have issued a significant amount of debentures / debt and the following parties are the debt unit holders:  \- GGP (as mentioned above) as a co-investor with Torian Capital  \- OASIS (considered a junior debenture holder); and  \- Hi-Med (another junior debenture holder)  From the chronology of IAN’s own press releases ([https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases)), it is obvious that the Company had used the cash raised to continue to expand, as they have opened dispensary after dispensary and have been granted numerous licenses to operate, grow, and sell in various states across the country. All looks well.  &amp;#x200B;  Suddenly, on April 6, 2020, right as COVID-19 strikes America, the Company announces a default on their interest payment on the secured debentures held by GGP above. The amount? $4.4M. Source: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/160/ianthus-announces-default-of-interest-obligations-to](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/160/ianthus-announces-default-of-interest-obligations-to)  Cash on-hand as at March 31, 2020 on their interim financial statements? Over $6M. Why default when there is the ability to pay? Cash preservation? Does not make sense, particularly if the Company knew that defaulting would enable the secured debt holders to demand repayment of the sum of the entire principle and interest, which the Company then would not be able to pay at once without further financing. Source for cash on-hand at Q1 2020 is the published financial statements at: [https://www.ianthus.com/investors/financial-reports](https://www.ianthus.com/investors/financial-reports)  Isn’t it funny, then, that on June 23, 2020 that the debenture holders then indeed do exactly that? [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/171/ianthus-receives-demand-for-payment-and-notice-of-intention](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/171/ianthus-receives-demand-for-payment-and-notice-of-intention)  &amp;#x200B;  But hold on, there are more interesting details in between these dates:   On March 31, 2020 there were allegations made against the Company and its CEO (Hadley Ford at the time). Direct from IAN’s press release dated April 27, 2020:   “Broadly stated, the allegations were that Hadley Ford (""Ford""), the Company's CEO, is or has been acting in a conflict of interest and has misused iAnthus' resources to his own benefit.  In response, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to form the Special Committee and retain outside counsel to conduct a detailed investigation.  The same PR revealed that Hadley Ford entered into a private undisclosed loan funded by GGP to the tune of $160,000 USD and that it should have been disclosed to the Board. Because of this “apparent conflict of interest” Hadley became a scape goat, took the “L” and stepped down based on the special committee’s recommendation to the board. Source: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/ianthus-announces-conclusion-of-special-committees](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/ianthus-announces-conclusion-of-special-committees)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Really? A well-known Wall Street banker falling for a $160k loan on the back of his much higher salary and number of equity shares held in this company? Doubt, anyone? Could this have been a ruse? Perhaps a red herring to create a current roster that is in line with the current course? How interesting that the lender of the $160,000 loan also happened to have been from GGP, the same party now asking to take over all assets of IAN for pennies on the dollar.  Isn’t that convenient timing though? Keep in mind, it is clear from the above article that Hadley had to step aside in purgatory awaiting judgement for the duration of this investigation (i.e. beginning at least March 31, 2020), at which time Randy Maslow (current interim CEO) would have stepped up to be “acting CEO” in Hadley’s stead. So, who really made the decision to default on the $4.4M interest payment above which enabled the lenders to chase after the entirety of the Company’s assets? Does the current interim CEO really have shareholder value in mind?   All recent press releases have been signed off and approved by Randy Maslow (see his signature at the end of each recent press release), which encourages shareholders in BOLD and UNDERLINE to vote YES in FAVOR of the “PLAN OF ARRANGMENT” which is a synonym of “shitty deal that wipes out shareholder value” – existing shareholders of IAN who had bought in when the stock price was above $1 per share, are now working to fight this plan as it is considered oppressive and unfair.  Plan of arrangement proposed July 13, 2020 here: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/172/ianthus-announces-execution-of-support-agreement-for-a](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/172/ianthus-announces-execution-of-support-agreement-for-a)  &amp;#x200B;  Effectively, the “plan of arrangement” provides debenture holders with 97.25% of IAN; and leaves all remaining shareholders about 2.75% of the pie, of which each bag-holding shareholder that had previously bought into this stock has to fight over, like dogs fighting over scraps of food. In order for this “deal” to pass, more than 50% of each class of stakeholder (i.e. each debenture holder, each equity shareholder including common shareholders) must vote “YES” in favor of the arrangement, otherwise the Company will purportedly go through CCAA to have it resolved.  Voting deadline is Sept 9, with the meeting to take place on Sept 10. Votes can only be cast by shareholders of IAN as at August 6, 2020 or earlier.  &amp;#x200B;  **THE (HIGHLY RISKY\*) POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY**  As a result of the announcement of the plan above, the share price of IAN has fallen to a market capitalization of 10-14M (about CAD 8.5-9c per share; USD 6-7c per share) DESPITE:   \- Having about $400M of gross total assets on their balance sheet;  \- Having over 40 operational stores (for comparative purposes, look into Trulieve) multiple facilities, and numerous licenses in multiple states;  \- Continuing to open dispensaries across the nation;  \- Cannabis sales booming due to COVID-19 restrictions, and an upcoming US election where the industry is anticipated to be a hot topic  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Comparable peers are trading at multiples above their book values; and had IAN not been involved in the current proposed “deal” the stock would be trading well above current prices (if valued at net book value as per the balance sheet, then considering current prices, and assuming the market values IA at least at 1x book value, then the share price would be well above 50c and the opportunity here is to quintuple your money and more).  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  This play is HIGH RISK because:   \- The “deal” / plan of arrangement is contingent on more than 50% of the votes from all classes of stakeholders to vote “YES” in favor of the transaction. Large groups of common shareholders including the junior debenture holders are seemingly NOT in favor of this plan. Highly speculative, but possible that the “deal” is renegotiated in the very near-term.  \- If the VOTE results are “YES” – shareholders effectively give up complete control of the Company as there will be 97% dilution incoming to satisfy the deal, leaving shareholders with 2.75% of what’s left of the pie. And this is not including options that could be granted after the deal is implemented.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  \- If the VOTE results are “NO” – the Company goes into CCAA (i.e. be ready for a stock HALT where your money will be “stuck” for a up to a few months) where a third-party independent body will decide and allocate the assets such that creditors are made whole (i.e. GGP, OASIS, Hi-Med) first and then the rest are left for shareholders. The Company is pushing shareholders to vote “YES” in favor in order to skip the CCAA process altogether but leave older shareholders bag-holding, with little to no support on how any share appreciation could be had with 97% dilution to come assuming the deals goes through.   In simple terms, 2.75% of 400M in gross total assets (based on most recent financials, which already includes impairment loss of $200M with 100% the Goodwill from the earlier MPX acquisition written-off), is 11M. The total debt of IAN is $198M (source from IAN’s August 28, 2020 press release: “As at August 27, 2020, the Company had approximately US$135 million owing to the Secured Lenders and approximately US$63 million owing to the Debenture holders, with each such debt tranche continuing to accrue interest and other charges.” – on the flip side, after CCAA rulings, that would leave approximately just over 50% of IAN’s value to shareholders. Isn’t 200M much better than 11M? Is it possible that enough shareholders vote “NO” and AGAINST the “deal” such that this comes to fruition (the high-risk element)? Again, what makes this play highly-risky is because the results of whether IAN approves of the 2.75% deal or goes to CCAA is highly dependent on the vote which is due Sept 9, 2020.  Between today and Sept 10, 2020 (speculative), there could be actions that can cause a modification to the too-obviously oppressive plan.  &amp;#x200B;  Based on the Press Release history of the Company, ask yourself:  1. Why does IAN Management (who presumably will be granted options in the newly structured Co assuming the deal goes through) publish multiple press releases in an effort to convince shareholders to vote YES in favor of 2.75%? In bold and underline, and taking the effort to event REBUT “misinformed” shareholders? Source: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/180/ianthus-corrects-purported-shareholders-groups-inaccurate;](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/180/ianthus-corrects-purported-shareholders-groups-inaccurate;)   a. References to 0% if IAN goes through CCAA are purely Management’s opinion based on flawed valuation of their own Company in an effort to sway voters for voting in FAVOR of the “deal” – why try so hard to sway voters? Look at the Q1 2020 financial statements yourself and the answer is right there.  b. Keep in mind all press releases (this applies to all publicly traded companies, are not reviewed, approved, etc. by auditors or the regulators of any kind; and are purely Management’s publishing – look at the bottom of each release where it states: “The Canadian Securities Exchange has not reviewed, approved or disapproved the content of this news release.”   &amp;#x200B;  2. Hadley conveniently was forced to take the “L” and resign right before the defaulting of payments and the start of this whole ordeal with the company and GGP. Coincidence?  3. Mark Dowley, a former Board Member on IAN, resigned out of the blue in the Company’s May 8, 2020 press release: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/164/ianthus-announces-resignation-of-mark-dowley-from-board-of](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/164/ianthus-announces-resignation-of-mark-dowley-from-board-of). How convenient to now be able to state in recent press releases that the Board unanimously agrees and recommends the “deal”? Get rid of the one guy that didn’t?  4. Elizabeth Stavola, a well-known professional in the cannabis industry that purportedly had a genuine interest in growing shareholder value, also resigned out of the blue as announced on August 4, 2020: [https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/175/ianthus-announces-resignation-of-elizabeth-stavola-as](https://www.ianthus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/175/ianthus-announces-resignation-of-elizabeth-stavola-as). Interesting?  &amp;#x200B;  **THE PLAY**  IAN at current prices is extremely undervalued. Significant upside could be had on speculative play assuming plan is modified, delayed or otherwise based on voting results.  &amp;#x200B;  **DISCLAIMER:** This is NOT investment advice.

But at SOME point, I think it'd be fair to say that even the biggest bulls have to admit that the recent runup has got to slow down at some point. With the stock almost touching $2300 (as of this writing), here's a different way to think of the valuation.   On a market cap basis, the company is worth more than VW, Toyota, BMW, Daimler and Ford COMBINED. But, the oft repeated argument is that TSLA is a tech company and deserves tech valuations. Let's give it that benefit of the doubt. Let's look at another tech company which essentially designs and manufactures high performance essential items: NVDA (it also helps that it's another meme stock on this subreddit).   NVDA's current market cap is roughly $315bn, or $100bn below the market cap of TSLA. Obviously NVDA has significantly higher gross margins, does business worldwide (much like TSLA, so enough of the China argument) and has (relatively speaking) fewer absolute competitors. However, even if assume that TSLA's gross margins improve significantly (which they may) and that the company increases revenue by 30% YoY, we're still talking of a MUCH higher valuation multiple than the one currently given to NVDA. Are they in completely different sectors? Sure. Does NVDA have higher margins and therefore demands a higher valuation multiple? Absolutely. Does NVDA have better patents and IP? Without the shadow of a doubt.   What about battery day and the potential of TSLA becoming the world's battery provider? It's certainly a possibility, but that's not what has happened so far, and to value the company currently as if it's a done deal would be a pretty stupid thing to do, especially given that true breakthroughs in battery innovation have been very, very sporadic over time.   Overall, I genuinely think this is a good point to short the shares. I sold 15 shares short @ $2275 today and have multiple weekly call options sold as well (the closest strike is at $2700 expiring tomorrow). Obviously the inclusion into the S&amp;P will keep support under the shares, but at some point, you have to believe that this market is going to pull back, and higher beta names like TSLA will lead the way.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1440046|public|confidence|self|TSLA is WAY overbought|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ihofxl/tsla_is_way_overbought/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-08-27|FORD

Slowly..*  GE had a rough week, losing nearly 6% of its value in five days of trading despite apparently signing a lucrative deal to bring the wonders of electricity to a desert war zone. Call holders were relieved to see that the worst was probably past by Friday, when the stock closed at a solid +$0.034 for the day.   The great BA, former bastion of retirement accounts everywhere, continued its fall from grace (just a sensor issue) by losing over 6% of its value this week. Why? Just pick any reason you feel like; there are plenty. Staggering layoffs, though bullish for some companies, were not for BA.  PFE, one of leading contenders for saving the world (in partnership with bIoNtEcH and Folsom Prison pharmaceuticals), popped the fuck off this week for a stunning 1.65% gain. Will it ever break into 40 again? Phase III trial results coming soon.  CSCO, after beating ER expectations but making the fatal mistake of being a boomer stock, maintained its beaten down atrocity of a stock price right around 42. Analysts the world over are calling for a higher price but “fuck that noise”, it said as it lost about another 0.7ish this week.  BAC and JPM lost a fuckton of percents (about 5ish) and yet you autists repeatedly told me not to buy calls. Why’d they lose so much value? Fuck if I know but I guess it’s priced in now.   Ford (F) began shitting the bed on Wednesday and didn’t stop for the rest of the week. Ending  -5.39% this week, it brings them to slightly negative for a month that saw them leap to gargantuan heights of almost +8%. As a fun illustration, you can now fit over 14 Fords underneath the market cap of TSLA so that’s nice.  Hope you enjoyed this snapshot of Boomerland for the week ending August 21, 2020.

(https://on.wsj.com/2E2BCM4)  &gt; Other participants in the call included Procter &amp; Gamble Co , Intel Corp, MetLife Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, United Parcel Service Inc, Merck &amp; Co Inc and Cargill Inc.  &gt; The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. (Reporting by Neha Malara in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)  Since Trump's execute order (legality pending) prevents any U.S. entity (corporation or person) from transact with WeChat, this will severely damage the ability of American companies to do business in China. Apple will like lose [90% of their iPhone (and in turn, Apple Watch) sales in China](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/china-iphone-users-prefer-wechat/) and all the other companies that have a large revenue stream from China.  For those who don't know, WeChat isn't just a message app, it's *the* platform where businesses conduct payment, e-commerce, marketing, etc from in China. It is so ubiquitous that even beggars on the streets carry QR code around in order to receive money.  I am not sure how asking all American consumer companies to commit Seppuku serves American interest. If anything this would be the Chinese government's protectionist policy wet dream. Huawei will likely take close to 100% of the high end phone market in China now if Apple is no longer able to sell phones in China, ironically at the order of the American government.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1406876|public|confidence|self|WeChat Ban could be Bad for Business|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9g5b1/wechat_ban_could_be_bad_for_business/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'mdhJ6a5O7imWboYXVlsQGN9KeUTM3inuI_QaXRpZxrk', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3634ab64f3ec928b8f2f2ad2f0d244fb8db5ced3', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ebe3dd55f00f2ec68b080965d4b80eed2d99860', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ab0a9493b937824a281fe0d4fc08cc3ae0cf3a2', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91041c97cd16628ebc10c37b7ac91d776122d0c', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5452e7fb6cbb3f56b989219281a4c71b61ca2f8', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a28fa4dcff0517e617c2ea011313e0833ee20b', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1mGWrTtfgGeLIQaijCSKbYT7-69kVv88JnBKO97wwss.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bb56e4e415053a38791ebdc686c02002a722c3c6', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-08-14|FORD

Background; PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. is a specialty financial services firm with a mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing of United States residential mortgage loans  HIGHLIGHTS; The operating environment for PFSI remains favorable with strong origination profitability. This will allow PFSI to continue to generate high ROEs and grow book value which should result in continued appreciation in PFSI shares  Gain on sale remains attractive: The second quarter will be a strong quarter for mortgage banking profitability given the combination of sequentially higher volumes and an elevated gain on sale margin. The primary-secondary mortgage spread (a proxy for GOS) remains elevated today and should continue to support strong mortgage banking profitability. Our estimates assume a moderation in the gain on sale from current levels over the next several quarters; this could prove too conservative in the near-term based on current trends  PFSI's very impressive revenue growth greatly exceeded the subsector average of 32.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 174.6%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector and the overall market, Pennymac Financial Services’s return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the subsector average and the S&amp;P 500. The gross profit margin for Pennymac Financial Services is rather high; currently it is at 60.80%. It has increased significantly from the same period last year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 39.09% is above that of the subsector average. Powered by its strong earnings growth of 543.10% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 100.12% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, PFSI should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year. Pennymac Financial Services reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, Pennymac Financial Services increased its bottom line by earning $4.89 versus $2.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($9.90 versus $4.89).  Pennymac Financial Services is a holding company. Through its subsidiaries, the company is a financial services firm with a mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing residential mortgage loans and the management of investments related to mortgage market. The company’s segments are: production, which performs mortgage loan origination, acquisition and sale activities; servicing, which performs loan servicing for both newly originated loans the company is holding for sale and loans the company services for others; and investment management, which represents the company’s investment management activities, which include the activities associated with investment asset acquisitions.  PennyMac Financial Services, Inc's operating earnings yield of 20.8% ranks above 98% of the other companies in the Ford universe of stocks  PennyMac Financial Services, Inc's earnings have increased from $2.70 to an estimated $10.02 over the past 5 quarters, they have shown strong acceleration in quarterly growth rates  TL;DR PFSI has outstanding fundamentals and technicals (it is garbage for those who don’t know) with signals hinted at breaking out on Q2 earnings as they outperform not only the indices but those in their sector as well.  🚀🚀🚀 and smd🌈🐻  100 8/21 45c  Sources;  https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=130&amp;documenttag=PFSI&amp;c_name=invest_VENDOR https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=20034&amp;documenttag=PFSI&amp;c_name=invest_VENDOR https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=1452&amp;documenttag=CSFBW50_1027442&amp;c_name=invest_VENDOR|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1386639|public|confidence|self|PFSI (PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.); A dd|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i33t2o/pfsi_pennymac_financial_services_inc_a_dd/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-08-03|FORD

A result of the merger between two niche players in the industry – U.S.-based I.D. Systems and Israeli firm Pointer Telocation – PowerFleet is a global provider of ""fleet management"" solutions. These solutions consist of...  1. Hardware that remotely captures real-world data. 2. Highly profitable Software as a Service (""SaaS"") products that catalog and interpret those data. We like the SaaS model because it's extremely ""sticky"" (meaning its customers tend to renew their subscriptions year after year), boasts high margins, and is capital efficient.  Utilizing the Internet of Things (""IoT"") – networks on which smart devices connect to each other and a central database in real time – these products track and analyze everything about a company's transportation fleet... including where the vehicles or equipment are, what they're carrying, what the temperature is, and how fast they're moving.  PowerFleet's full suite of solutions enables customers to improve efficiency, transport goods more quickly and securely, and – most importantly – cut costs. It also gives them a much greater understanding of their supply chains. Instead of having to rely on a foreman's line of sight to make sure their operations are running optimally, PowerFleet customers can simply open up a computer and see exactly what's going on at every level of their businesses.  PowerFleet faces some stiff competition from rivals with deep pockets and large-scale operations. For the most part, these competitors are the original equipment manufacturers.  For example, Crown Equipment – one of the top five forklift manufacturers in the world – does more than $3 billion in forklift sales annually. Much of that includes products with fleet-management capabilities that it builds and sells directly to customers.  If a business only uses equipment from Crown, it makes sense to purchase fleet-management solutions from that OEM as well. But the OEMs seem to offer this technology because it's what their customers want, not because they're best-suited to provide it.  So if the business wants to use multiple equipment vendors (a ""mixed fleet""), or if the vendor it  chooses doesn't offer fleet management, or even if it simply wants a better solution than the vendor offers... PowerFleet is there to fill the gap.  Essentially, PowerFleet is the ""Switzerland"" of fleet management. It's completely neutral and manufacturer-agnostic. As the trends and catalysts we'll discuss next really begin to take hold, this will be a key differentiator.  **PowerFleet's Winning Formula:**  PowerFleet combines IoT macro tailwinds with...  1. A business model that gets better as it gets bigger. 2. One of the world's largest and deepest-pocketed customer bases.  First, let's look at its ""razor and blade"" model...  PowerFleet's hardware sales (the initial ""razor"" purchase) beget its sticky, high-margin, capital-efficient SaaS business (the recurring ""blades"").  Second, PowerFleet's customer base gives it a huge advantage over the competition. Companies like Ford (F), Starbucks (SBUX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), and Walmart (WMT) already rely on PowerFleet for IoT solutions. And now, on its first-quarter earnings call, PowerFleet coyly noted it had won a contract with the ""world's largest online retailer,"" Amazon (AMZN).  As the ""Switzerland"" fleet-management provider, PowerFleet has far more opportunities to win contracts with these big customers than the OEMs do. The OEMs generally pitch for an entire contract of big-ticket items, such as providing all the forklifts for a firm's warehouses. But when a customer like an Amazon buys an entire fleet of forklifts, it's focused mainly on getting all that equipment for the best possible price – not on the added fleet-management solutions.  PowerFleet, on the other hand, can pitch its products and services to the Amazons of the world as a complement to their existing infrastructure. After spending millions on heavy machinery from multiple OEMs, customers don't mind spending a little more with a different company to improve their return on the bigger investment.  **Two for the Price of One:**  When I.D. Systems and Pointer Telocation announced their merger last year, they were valued at $114 million and $118 million, respectively.  Within two months of the merger closing, the new company's share price rose nearly 50%. But in March's wave of indiscriminate panic selling, PowerFleet's shares got crushed along with everyone else. They gave up roughly two-thirds of their value in five weeks.  And its market cap fell from $250 million to just $137 million. As a relatively new firm, PowerFleet is not yet consistently profitable (although Pointer was profitable on its own prior to the merger). But it has decades of experience from its parent companies and brings in more than $100 million in sales each year, roughly half of which comes from a high-margin SaaS business. There's no way PowerFleet should trade for less than I.D. Systems and Pointer Telocation's combined standalone values.  For some reason, the PowerFleet story has seemingly been forgotten by the investment community. Shares have recovered more than 50% off their lows but are still down 50% from their pre-pandemic highs.  PowerFleet has many avenues for growth and a built-in margin of safety given the recent sell-off. This confluence of growth and value is an anomaly we don't expect to last for long. If we get in now and stay invested for the long term, we could see life-changing gains.  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR: BUY/HOLD shares of PowerFleet (Nasdaq: PWFL)**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1386004|public|confidence|self|A Long Term Trade: PowerFleet (PWFL)|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i30ib9/a_long_term_trade_powerfleet_pwfl/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-08-03|FORD

At this current time Blink Charging broke my $10  call prediction and is at $12, however at this time I see company  valuation is too high and now it's inflated due to investor speculation.  Blink Charging just signed new deals with local governments and power  companies.  I  expect this company to keep making gains in the future, especially with  their wireless charging technology that they are working with EV car  companies on. Blink Charging focuses on charging ALL EV vehicles, not  some. Tesla chargers only work on SOME EVs, follow link for details:  [https://thedriven.io/2019/04/03/can-non-tesla-electric-cars-use-tesla-ev-chargers/](https://thedriven.io/2019/04/03/can-non-tesla-electric-cars-use-tesla-ev-chargers/)  Let's  think about this, Ford has a nationwide monopoly on automotive cars in  the early 20th century, but soon there were competitors. I give Tesla 10  years before comparable EV cars from other companies show up to compete  with them. If you think car companies can't catch up don't be so cocky,  Tesla has open source technology because Elon thinks EV cars should  replace current cars and doesn't care who makes EV cars as well. This  means more EV cars on the road from popular car companies like Nissan or  Toyota, and those japs are great at making cars. This is why I believe  Blink Charging will be the future of EV car charging.

I will likely write about some like Corteva. I have written about KSU and Cloudflare so far.  # EARNINGS PLAYS   \- **AMD.** Anticipating blowout sales. Their machining is excellent and more can be read about it here.  [https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-epyc-trip-to-rome-amd-is-cloudflares-10th-generation-edge-server-cpu/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-epyc-trip-to-rome-amd-is-cloudflares-10th-generation-edge-server-cpu/)  TSMC earnings will be a test case for this. But TL;DR AMD is cost effective as fucking hell, data centers are building out, and they want the best shit for the best price. AMD was there when they needed to be there.  \- **Facebook.** I believe that Facebook will begin to seriously highlight their progress and plans for e-commerce trade at the global stage in places like Brazil, Canada, US, Mexico, and India while discussing various other things like investments with Walmart, Shopify, and Rio. They will have many subjects to brief on like voter drives, advertiser damage, political and security measures to reconcile with investor attitudes.  **- Dropbox.** I think people are sleeping on this. They have a strong hold on academia file management, excellent storage engineers that can anticipate data center changes, and HelloSign for business legal agreements and cross border requirements.  \- **Cloudflare.** I think they'll have a massive boost in revenue and a continued and more developed focus on how to profit from video infrastructure from companies like [JD.com](https://JD.com) and [Cloudflare.tv](https://Cloudflare.tv) . Privacy in China will be a long and hard fought battle and the future is inevitably e-commerce, video commerce, and the infrastructure required to make that competitive.  &amp;#x200B;  # USMCA

This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 7/15 TSLA 1250p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.  I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only features in the room are what I assume to be a Model X and a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, TSLA 2000. P/E exceeding infinity.  I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell and Elon Musk step in front of me. I try to speak up but Powell cuts me off. ""What am I-""  ""Why did you short Tesla Motors?"" he asks.  ""Huh?"" I respond, confused.  ""Why did you short Tesla Motors?"" he demands, louder this time.  ""I, uh... the market cap is higher than Ford, Toyota and GM combined.. It's not sustainable! It's-"" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.  ""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short Tesla?""  Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. TSLA has climbed to 3000. Impossible, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 50 percent and they can't sell that many cars!"" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Trillions in investment grade bonds from Tesla. Loans to Liberty University. Loans to Goldman Sachs  ""Repeat after me: Tesla only go up,"" Powell and Musk demand in unison.  I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, TSLA has climbed well over 5000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.  Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short Tesla Motors?""  I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""Tesla market cap can't exceed all automotive industries in the world! GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.  ""Tesla only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows TSLA has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 10000 in the dust, making new all time highs.  The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.  ""Tesla only go up,"" I say.  Shamelessly stolen from SA's Doomsday Economics thread. I mean, I made this."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1338679|public|confidence|self|A real life story about Tesla|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hqofq0/a_real_life_story_about_tesla/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-07-13|FORD

It’s the most amazing thing, no one knew anything about Corona until a few weeks ago.   But the moment I heard about it—the Wuhan flu; it’s also the Wuhan, or WuHAAN—that’s a city in China. Many people don’t know that. But the moment I heard about this Chinese flu, I ordered a test. And it’s an amazing test. We do better testing than anywhere in the world. Some say the Germans have the best tests, but they don’t. Our tests are even better.  So you’re positive for Corona. And usually “positive” is a positive word—it’s a very good word, frankly. Everybody thinks it’s good, apart from what you hear on the news—which is fake. It’s largely fake. But in medicine, “positive” is not so good. So it’s very confusing. And I’ve always been very clear about that. Some say “positive” is always good, but I’ve never agreed with that.  So you’re positive for the Corona. But you’ll be fine. Totally fine. You might think you’re going to die—and everybody does die, eventually. But you’ll be fine. You feel fine, right? You won’t need a ventilator. There are no ventilators—but you won’t need one.   How old are you, 55? You won’t need one. Some people need a ventilator, and they’re amazing machines. Did you know the first ventilator was made by Henry Ford? It’s an incredible piece of equipment. But you’ll be fine.  The virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. But you have two of them. Some say you have a spare. Some people only have one lung. It’s true. But I don’t talk about spares. I always want both. Given a choice, I want two lungs.  So I’ve asked nurse—what’s your name, Nancy?—I’ve asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you’re really incredible. You’re not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn’t think so. Nancy will bring you whatever you need. And if you start coughing, do that into your elbow, so you don’t make a mess. Okay, you’re doing great. I’ll see you later.

The analyst highlights that a consumer survey shows roughly 10% of its respondents were willing to pay for a USD 5/mth plan without ads and more analytic services. Citi estimates if such a service were to occur, it would be priced at USD 20/year internationally and USD 60/year in the US, assuming a 5% penetration for base case and 10% for its bull case with advertisements, the analyst believes the revenue contribution would be limited.

While the 2021 F-150 release was just a mild refresh of the current generation (with slightly better styling imo), the Bronco will eat into the market share of the Wrangler, which is wildly popular and basically unchallenged. I think this catalyst could push for a MACD cross on the 1 month chart. Also, with EV's being so hot right now, in the fall, they are releasing the Mach E. The Mach E undercuts the Model Y by $10k, and we all know that with EV's, it's going to be a race to the bottom in terms of price. Ford has the experience and production capabilities to make a lot more EV's than Tesla, and I suspect fewer quality control issues to plague the vehicles than the early Tesla's. It's been a common sentiment I have been seeing that $TSLA is ""too high imo"" in comparison to other auto manufacturers with way more revenue, but I think that perhaps other vehicle manufacturers are undervalued, and the release of new EV's (particularly crossover-sized vehicles) will make the market realize this. Or maybe I'm wrong and electric cars are going to be a boutique luxury item for quite a bit longer. Either way, I suspect people are going to be trepidatious to travel by plane for a bit longer, and perhaps turn to more long distance car travel.

Notably NCL and RCL - consider a buy \*IF\* you think the cruise industry won't completely go under like I do.   \*INTC is kind of being ignored right now, given the hype for AMD, and other tech stocks. Consider a buy depending on how the stock performs the next few days. Remember - intel still has ALL the market share in high end gaming PCs (for now) until AMD can really step it up with Zen 3 (Ryzen 4000 series GPUs   \*NVDA is straight up a BUY. If you don't see how/why then honestly this stock is not for you. If you have traded it before - you know exactly why this stock will pretty much only go up until the RTX 3000 series officially drop.  \-----  Airlines. Kind of a shit show right now in my opinion. But... if you find AAL or DAL attractive at their current price points - consider a BUY  \-----   **Fairly confident**  AMZN - fuck it at this point it can only go up right? BUY  TSLA - If you're not already in this stock (WTF are you doing?) Look for an entry point at 1350 or lower if at all possible the next week  MSFT - Honestly this has been a solid performer now for 5 years or so. BUY  GOOG, FB - Either buy or hold - depending on how much these EU and future American anti-trust laws worry you  AAPL - Fuck it.

To avoid crowding out non-government debt, the Fed has stepped into risky bond markets and started buying those bonds to increase liquidity, this has some effect of delaying inflation but that balance sheet will unwind slowly.  Anyway, if we assume that inflation will rise at a higher level that we saw in the last few years, the real winners will be people and companies with huge amounts of debt that are able to maintain enough cash flow to pay those obligations.  Their debts will be eroded by inflation, and taking on enormous amounts of debt will likely result in windfall profits assuming what they financed with debt appreciates at the same level of inflation (think share buy backs).  ""the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017, "".[1]. So, by taking out loans to buy stock, which will keep pace with inflation, the companies that have participated in this behavior will stand to make huge returns, at the expense of the debt holders (at this point the fed and anyone with a savings account).   So, what are some companies that stand to benefit from this?  Any company with a huge amount of debt, little cash on hand, a large number of repurchased shares, and a strong enough business model to not default on debt.   These are the stocks I think would fall into that category.  It's important to note that companies like MSFT and APPL sitting on mountains of cash may be forced into share buybacks to avoid inflation, thus further driving up their stock prices as well.  United Parcel Service (UPS) Charter Communications (CHTR)  Verizon Communications (VZ)  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  IBM Corp. (IBM)  Ford Motor Co. (F)  I'd be interested what your thoughts are?   Tldr; inflation goes up. Companies with debt that don't default will be rewarded. Companies that might default probably bailed out and rewarded also. Companies with lots of cash will have their value eroded.

The apex on most of these charts (cyan trend lines) is on the 8th or 9th, so I'm expecting tomorrow to be the last day to load up on cheap calls for July or August and make some quick tendies on the ride back to the 200 DMA.

I predominately sit in passive etfs. Frankly, they’re the play. Avoid a lot of dumb risk through diversified holdings. Reap 6-12% a years. I’ve played LEAPS on some simple logic plays, DIS options on Disney plus potential (was not properly priced, imo) and FB options on election ad revenue. These were 1/15/21 leaps I bought in January, before corona. I escaped up $12k in May... I held through hell. Down $30k at one point. DIS was sold for a loss and FB was big win.  Now...  I believe the market was disregarding the widespread, wildfire nature of covid. The spread of NYC was catastrophic. I knew the south would be a hot spot approaching summer due to AC. AC has been shown by the CDC to reinforce viruses reach.  So, on June 3rd, I pulled about $70k of cash from portfolio. I figured the recovery was over treading the actual recovery. Then, the market carried up 3-5% on Wednesday (June 5th). I pulled another $130k of cash from portfolio. So, $200k cash and $100k diversified, passive.  I invested $20k in a double short Brazilian etf, I believe they’re a mortal lock for Covid and this would HEDGE my $100k us stock - if we start falling.  On Thursday, there was a blood bath, -6%. If there was a dead bounce Friday (below 3%), I would buy. Market tilted up, 1%? But, that’s nothing after a huge sell off. Airlines, cruises, and hotel/casino BOUNCED 10-15%. So, I figured the market really thought wave 2 wouldn’t happen. So, I bought puts on the logical bets: airlines (UAL), cruises (CCL), and Hotel/Casino (MGM). 7/17, $50k total, on Friday June 5th.  I was down $15k a week ago. I’m now up $25k (avoiding losses from market dropping from heights I sold, spy 320?). I’m holding until a major sell off around 4th of July. I’m expecting SPY 275 (+/- 15). The FED wants to deflate the bubble (balance sheet REDUCING in back to back weeks). FED will let a drop to 270, but will then let it slow bleed.  From there, I may join theta gang with a tilt towards downward bleed. Sell comfortable saddles to rake premiums in a good range. I’d be comfortable with writing covered calls too. I’ll consider writing saddles around cloud-based companies (MSFT and Amazon, first come to mind). I believe the downsides of their models are bolstered by their clouds. more Covid, more work from home, more cloud. also, if market pops, they won’t be the first brigade up. Travel, etc. will carry. I need to learn more about credit spreads and the like to be comfortable executing such a trade.  I’m considering playing puts across the entire auto industry with a hedge in a reliable car manufacturer (sorry, not Tesla boys). Ford? I’d likely play these towards 8/21 puts that are out of the money. I would likely do the call on ford a bit out, also for 8/21. No one is driving... there is supposed to be summer spike to oil prices... not even close this year. Spring is a car buying season... it starts in March and carries the entire spring. Who was buying cars during a global pandemic shutting down the nation? No one; people were hoarding money (April or may was highest savings month ever). So, earnings will be catastrophic for auto, imo, especially fucking TSLA. I’ll probably look to allocate $40k to the automaker puts and $15k to ford calls. There could be auto bailout discussions like 08, but I don’t know.  I believe my hypothesis is fucked by huge vaccine news, a lack of hospitalizations and deaths in TX, FL, AZ, and CA. I believe AZ is most fucked (almost mortal lock, oops). I believe we could tank on bad housing news or consume/student defaults. A tech bubble is flirted about on this sub, I don’t buy it. Tech is the future and foundational for the economy, as it should be with long term growth views, especially with shift to more downtime at home.  Long-term, I am worried for actual Wave 2, but I hope with greater knowledge of steroids, remdesivir, and plasma, we will be able to weather the storm. I believe SPY 220 leaps for 1/15 could be juicy. I’d consider SPY 220 and SPY 350 strangle as a better alternative. I’d wait for volatility to settle down a bit, hopefully near 270... we could also float 300 flat for 1 month, who knows.  I’d be happy to take questions to fill any gaps I inevitably missed. I don’t know a lot, but I do know somethings.  TLDR:  - Spy puts 7/17 285 - Auto puts 8/21 (10% below current price), id buy a hedge in reliable automaker for 8/21 (ford) - Starting end of July, if my prediction holds, I’d buy reaching leaps for 220 spy and 350 spy for 1/15/21. I would have saddles around cloud-based companies (MSFT and Bezos) - Theta gang with a tilt to slow bleed after July 4th selloff|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1303762|public|confidence|self|My Investment Hypothesis|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgok9o/my_investment_hypothesis/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-06-27|FORD

COVID testing stocks are through the roof. For the past month, I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what to invest in. After the recent bull market, finding real opportunity is a crapshoot. I've been following the news hoping to find a trend, and I think I've got it: thermal camera temperature screening. This is where FLIR, the largest thermal imaging manufacturer in the world, comes in. Today, I bought $8K in calls and $100,000 in stock. This is 1/10th of my portfolio so I don't take it lightly.   **The Chart**  Let’s start with the chart. The stock is currently at $40 support, is forming a round bottom, and looks prime for a bounce. There was some early interest when news came out that Amazon was installing thermal imaging at all their facilities and FLIR went up 15% in a single day. Since then, hype died down and day traders took profit. Because of the low liquidity in this stock, people exiting positions caused it to fall significantly. Now that interest is picking up again, the same low liquidity is going to help this skyrocket. The time to get in is now, especially with the breaking news that LAX is using FLIR for thermal imaging. I expect this to cause a spike in the stock tomorrow once this hits the news cycle.   Below are some links that I’ve complied. These are small snapshot to show that skin temperature thermal imaging will be the foundation of the reopening. If you search “thermal imaging” on Google News, you’ll see the hundreds of other organizations that have adapted this technology.   .  .  .  .  **Warehouses/Factories/Manufacturing**   Amazon: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/flir-systems-soars-on-report-of-amazon-use-of-thermal-cameras  Ford: https://wwjnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/ford-says-plants-will-be-back-to-full-production-by-monday  **Tourism**  Disney: https://youtu.be/sVoJpCN13S8?t=64  **Airports**  My personal anecdote: A friend of mine who is in maintenance at a medium size airport said they just spent millions of dollars on thermal imaging equipment.

They recently released new software for this very purpose and are well ahead of the competition and are transitioning to a SAAS model after a massive restructuring. It is transforming into a tech company, but is trading at an industrial valuation.   **THE MASSIVE CHERRY ON TOP:**   FLIR has a complete monopoly because it's the only thermal imaging company that has FDA approved products for monitoring skin temperature. Guess what that means?  Every single organization in the United States that is using thermal cameras for body temperature screening MUST use FLIR’s products. There is absolutely no alternative. That means that every organization listed above is using FLIR.   https://www.flir.com/discover/public-safety/thermal-imaging-for-detecting-elevated-body-temperature/  **My personal research:**   1. I called FLIR, pretending to be a customer. Their backlog is months, and they've never had a backlog this huge.   2. I called over a dozen organizations that adopted thermal temperature screening to ask what vendor they're using. Out of the seven that gave me information, every single one is using FLIR. I even got through to one CFO who personally approved the thermal camera purchase for that facility. He said that only FLIR was considered because it was the only vendor that fit the requirements for human use. This is consistent with them being a monopoly as stated above.

With Nikola trading only $1 billion away from the current value of Ford and not expecting revenue until at least late 2021, I feel everyone can agree this company is overvalued.  One reason the stock has exploded in value is due to the potential ""$10 billion in sales"" coming from ""14,000 reservations."" Nikola is not expecting the production of its trucks to begin until at least late 2021. This delay would be followed by full production capability being met sometime in the second half of 2022. Currently, there are only 39 hydrogen filling stations in the U.S. (35 in California). This number is tiny in comparison to the approximately 25,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. as of March 2020. It would be a considerable feat if Nikola were able to finish developing their truck, construct a manufacturing facility, and construct the hydrogen infrastructure around the country necessary for a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to operate all in just two years.  Hydrogen vehicles are also inherently less efficient than electric vehicles. A hydrogen vehicle requires that 1) electricity be used to produce and compress hydrogen (Nikola claims all its hydrogen stations will use this method with renewable energy), and 2) that stored hydrogen be used in a hydrogen vehicle to create electricity.

Fully electric cars do not have to convert electricity and are therefore more efficient. Currently, converting water to hydrogen is approximately 75% efficient and requires a massive amount of electricity. Nikola claims that they will use renewable energy to produce all the hydrogen at its stations, which will undoubtedly increase costs further.  The increased costs associated with hydrogen are why both Honda and Toyota have virtually abandoned their fuel cell vehicle development. In fact, Honda's fuel cell-powered Clarity had such low sales that Honda developed it to be a fully electric vehicle that runs on batteries.  Hydrogen is not the way to a more renewable future and is almost always going to be a more expensive and less efficient option when compared to electricity.

With Nikola trading only $1 billion away from the current value of Ford and not expecting revenue until at least late 2021, I feel everyone can agree this company is overvalued.  One reason the stock has exploded in value is due to the potential ""$10 billion in sales"" coming from ""14,000 reservations."" Nikola is not expecting the production of its trucks to begin until at least late 2021. This delay would be followed by full production capability being met sometime in the second half of 2022. Currently, there are only 39 hydrogen filling stations in the U.S. (35 in California). This number is tiny in comparison to the approximately 25,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. as of March 2020. It would be a considerable feat if Nikola were able to finish developing their truck, construct a manufacturing facility, and construct the hydrogen infrastructure around the country necessary for a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to operate all in just two years.

In 2020 they reported had just over 700,000.  ( [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/06/13/hertz-used-car-sales-deals-bankruptcy-coronavirus/3182105001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/06/13/hertz-used-car-sales-deals-bankruptcy-coronavirus/3182105001/) )  &amp;#x200B;  That's a shitload of cars about to hit the market if Hertz goes completely tits up.  That's a lot of cheap used cars.  Dirt cheap.  The kind of cheap that fucks new car sales.  Fucked new car sales means auto makers start having problems.  The kind of problems that require a big fat government bail out or auto workers make headlines joining the breadlines.  &amp;#x200B;  How bad can it be?  Well two of the most common rental rides are Fords and Toyotas.  Cheap rides easy, low overhead when you buy in bulk and can be flipped to the wholesaler market with ease as opposed to BMWs, Mercedes and other up scale brands.  &amp;#x200B;  When a rental ride has reached the end of it's usefulness to a rental company it gets sent off to a wholesale auction.  Like the one in Manhiem PA.  Nothing much there except a giant facility running tens of thousands of cars through auction a week.  Basically people stand in an aisle as cars roll past, bid lists in hand winking and nodding hoping to get a car cheap.  &amp;#x200B;  The nice rental rides go to outfits like Carmax where they aim to only buy cars they have to dump about 2500 bucks into to get showroom ready.  It's how they keep their prices cheap and can do the no haggle thing.  The banged up rides end up at buy-here-pay-here places that have made loan sharking an art.  &amp;#x200B;  So suddenly used Fords and Toyotas from anywhere from 10,000 miles to 120,000 miles are out there on the market.  What is Ford going to do with their new line?  2021 models are just starting to roll off the line and into the market in time for the close of the year.  Same as Toyota.  Before 2020 is over their new car line hits right towards the end of the year.  &amp;#x200B;  So what happens to all those unsold 2020s?  You guessed it off to the auction where dealers can hedge their losses by selling them at auction.  They might have bought it from the factory for 30,000 and they have likely financed those purchases.  So they make money on selling you financing at a much higher rate, add-ons, and warranties.  But when that doesn't happen they have a 30,000 lump of plastic crap taking up space, getting older on the the lot.  &amp;#x200B;  So off the the auction where they hope to sell it close to what they paid for it.  And the car buyers know this.  They will sit there and let the dealer no sell for a few weeks till the floor drops.  The dealer let's a bunch go and then tightens up again in hopes of raising the floor next week.  This bleeding process goes on all year 2 to 3 times a week.  &amp;#x200B;  So now you have your regular inventory that shows up to one of these auctions.  Suddenly now you have Hertz dumping its entire fleet.  Cheap cars, cheap inventory and the savings gets passed onto the consumer.  So many cars the only thing to do is sell them ASAP.  &amp;#x200B;  You don't need a new car if you can get a deal on a cheap rental ride.  Ford and Toyota can't sell their new models, that means they don't need employees and that means a shit load of auto workers out of job IN AN ELECTION YEAR.  Ford is a classic American brand that's mostly manufactured overseas, and Toyota last time I checked employs the most American autoworkers.  That's some real shitty optics.  &amp;#x200B;  So what's cheaper, paying Hertz to stay in business and not dump a shit ton of wrecks on the market.  Or bailing out at least one major automaker when new car sales tank due to a flood of cheap cars?  &amp;#x200B;  If the government intervenes.  Buy Calls Hertz.  &amp;#x200B;  If the government fucks everyone.  Puts on Hertz, Ford, Toyota.  Buy Calls Carmax, cheap inventory and ruthless reconditioning process and workplace environment will see their stock rise.\*  You can probably do puts on the other American Automakers too as the panic from lagging new car sales seeps into MM collective thinking.  &amp;#x200B;  \*In case you are still wondering how they rose from 67 dollars to 93 over the past 4 years it isn't sales.  They drastically slashed their overhead by replacing most of their work force from ""salaried management"" making 38 to 50k a year to 15 dollar and hour wage slaves that doing the same job.  They still have buyers but only a few of them now.  They still have a huge spending budget so they still get to bully auctions into taking cars back, ripping up bills of sale if they buy the wrong car in an auction lane, have their meals and lodgings paid for buy the auction facility because they dunk that much cash into the coffers.  I'll do a breakdown one day of why KMX is a company to watch for decline over the next 10 years."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1278440|public|confidence|self|Why Hertz Has To Get Bailed Out And Why The Government Is Fucking Stupid If They Don't.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9wxks/why_hertz_has_to_get_bailed_out_and_why_the/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'jisfx6jljMKS2uyM-OtuPhcs8DkKiqThZDH4ACSBPPw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9b0e8f68e72d7480f134bafd93d9f333804b96e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4120f1d701af45add730c9acab0923571ef3b37', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bb921eefa69817b06a0be3231df90469ec1b006', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6abaa1c188a29b2ef87dcdc117d947c59e071470', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a20a20b53244a88dd7a83948fc4c988fbfc402eb', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005810949160cd2ef5c8889489810e16934affb2', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1801, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CrcW3xyYgbYmOQNPVOucPw3NAUIQkvYcSlnsE9XCXcw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8092bd0d460df601a062d34ff5b183d6315e679c', 'width': 3200}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-06-16|FORD

Whether you feel directionless, despairing, or just angry at the Federal Reserve, we have the animal to represent you:  1. Bear Gang – A relic of the Wall Street where men were men and companies had to earn money. Adherence to bear philosophy comes with a natural self-righteousness in the confidence that western civilization is an unsustainable debt bubble. Just a few more coronavirus deaths and you’ll be content, you promise. You lose money, but you’re morally right.  2. Bull Gang – Your only regret is that you didn’t buy more. You sleep well at night because you are invested in the engine of the country you love. Your faith is rewarded when stocks only go up. Your wife may not love you for your intelligence, but she’ll be content with taking half of the investment account in fifteen years.  3. Kangaroo Gang – Thriving on market volatility, adherence to the principles of the Kang Gang means that you attempt to execute multi-legged options strategies. No matter which direction the underlying stock moves, you’ll still lose to the computers who do it better. Like a kangaroo, you’ll bounce right out of this gang when you fully realize that profits are capped and you’re too poor to give up gambling so young.  4. Sloth Gang – If you hadn’t slept through market open, you might have made a really good play today. You’re sitting mostly in cash, because nothing is a sure thing. Often, you hover over the limit buy button until the price of the underlying moves up (and becomes too expensive) or down (that was probably the top). Even though you rarely ever make moves, you still hang around every day.   5. Tortoise Gang – You invested your pension in a broad index of stocks fifty years ago. You never came close to paying the taxes that you’ve taken out in social security. You’ve been receiving deliveries of physical gold bullion for years to better weather the downturn that won’t come until after you’re dead. At least your offspring will provide liquidity in the options market for a time with their inheritance.  6. Housefly Gang – Persistent, annoying, and attracted to whatever excrement the market dumps out, you breed freely in the corpses of Hertz, Ford, and JCP. You are numerous, but never alive for long.  7. Vampire Bat Gang – Known commonly as Theta Gang outside of the taxonomic hierarchy, you gain from siphoning the profits of other gangs. Your toxic presence is a carrier for harmful options that infect bulls and bears alike. You are perfectly content to bide your time in the shadows, clinging to large outcroppings of capital. You might eventually sell naked and get turned into soup.  8. Opossum Gang – Primarily nocturnal, you feed on futures and pre-market movements from Tokyo to Frankfurt. You’ll eventually end up run over and dead on the side of the road, which is an excellent indicator for other gangs to trade on.  9. White Rhino Gang – Still technically alive but teetering on the brink of extinction, your account is down 99% all-time after getting blown up by a play on a Chinese stock nobody remembers. After the Reddit upvotes fade, you’ll still be there. Alone, and with no hope for the future.  10. Yang Gang – All you ever wanted was the Coronavirus stimulus checks, but with fewer steps.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1276279|public|confidence|self|Bull, Bear, Or Something Else?

Boomers have also been piling in lured by what they see as a cheap dividend stock.  Will fundamental economics and the law of financial gravity pay off on F bears?  Or will meme strength and FOMO greed win out for the F bulls?  Why bother trying to bet on it?  Instead open a long strangle position.  I am looking at F 7/17 6p and 7c.   Last time I checked on the closing prices they were about \~$38/contract each.Thoughts?  EDIT:  rough math tell us the stock needs to move 11.7% or more to be profitable in either direction.  (38+38)/$6.46 closing price = 11.7%.  Ideally I prefer to open strangles on stocks with &lt;10% but F seems to be  a promising candidate b/c of its popularity - no doubt due in large part to its low price and iconic name across all generations.    They also have an EV  division which will either end in flaming failure to compete with TSLA or bring them back to at least the teens.  But that is long term speculation and I am just looking at this within a 1 month time window for a trade.  |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1273218|public|confidence|self|Ford Strangles|0.0|[]|0.84|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8l4w2/ford_strangles/|no_ads|0.0||||||||1592101415.0||||||||2020-06-14|FORD

Sit down and let me spin you a yarn about how I came to the shining beacon of light Hertz.  It was 1985. Without any prospects of a love life, I signed up for a VHS mail-in dating service. That's when Ronda came in my life, we talked for hours. I didn't have much money though, so I used the pay phone down by the honky-tonk bar. Eventually our lustful ways couldn't be subdued and we agreed to meet.  The next day, I packed my things. Ninja stars, my eight-track player, a copy of Hustler, and my favorite pube comb ""Johnny Flame"".  The Hertz dealership was right next door to my hut in the retention ditch by the road. I'd fashioned it out of old cardboard boxes and chewing gum I'd taken out of dirty ash trays.  At first, I didn't think they rent to me. I'd been caught once siphoning gas out of the Ford Pintos and huffing it behind the employee break area. But it had been awhile and I need a sweet ride. So I walked in confidently. After all, I had stuffed my wranglers to the brim with old aluminum foil. No balls no brass tacks.  If it's not obvious, I meant business.  The young gun behind the counter stared at me, ""Sir I told you last time, you can't keep getting free coffee here. Please leave""  ""Not today slick. I need a hot ride."" I snorted, flecks of coke-laded snot spraying the countertop.  ""Really?""  ""Yea sonny. I've been playing the stratchers. Here look.""  I held up a bag of quarters I'd gotten from the parking meters. Not rocket science, just the mighty power of a methamphetamine induced strength. That of ten autists.  ""Sir please, I can't take that. It won't even fit in the register""  "" This is America and I will not be denied my right to due process""  ""What..Plea...""  ""No listen here, I didn't go to fight and die for my country in Vietnam to hear you gum me about my finances. Now give me a damn car so I can see my hot girl Ronda.""  ""Who.."" He trailed off and gazed, choices needed to be made. As his eyes fell down to my rocking python bulge, he somehow mumbled, ""Okay okay, I'll rent you a car we only have the Ford Pinto outside. It's a bit beat up but it'll ride.""  Then I was off to see my sweet Rhonda. We agreed to meet at the Armadillo Bar in Tucson Arizona.  Man what a smooth ride it was. This thing was a bitchin' sex machine. I pulled up to the parking lot and got out. Moments after I took a few steps, a weird haze filled my brain , like there were eyes burning through my finely comb mullet.  Never have I felt so unnerved and I've done my far share of illegal donkey shows down in Tijuana.  A voice called out, "" Sonny! Come here.""  I froze and turned, an old man hunched over a walker complete with Guy Fieri-esque flames down the side. Quite the nice touch. Long flowing hair jutted out from his head but no hair sat upon it.  ""Listen old man, I'm trying to wet my whistle and eat some down south chowder on my lady friend."" I was surprised at my courage, like some defense mechanism was triggered by the ghost of Christmas Douche visiting me.  ""You still got Johnny Flame?""  How could he know. He narrowed his eyes and waddled closer, ""Ahhh you haven't realized.""  I couldn't respond.  ""Listen here and don't talk. I'm you from the future and I came back to tell you something.""  Could it be true? I looked him up and down. I blurted out, ""How? That's impossible. You must been Rhonda's friend joking with me. Now scooter on out of here.""  ""No I'm not and I'm gunna prove it . In 1977, you, or I guess we, snuck on down to the Miller's old house and started sniffing the neighbors panties we never got caught because we were just too slick.""  ""How could you know that? I never told anyone?""  ""Listen I don't have time here boy, you need to listen up. It was very dangerous to get here, I had to spike like five security guards and blow the CSO . I just need to tell you one thing.""  ""What.""  ""In the future you ain't got nothing. just like you do now down in them cardboard huts. Now in the future, it's bitching because they got that VR porn but you ain't got no money. We bet the house in 2020, those Stocktwits and big sacked Bulls kept telling us to buy Hertz. They said it don't matter if they ain't got no money or are tied up in them courts. It's a sure thing they said. Something about tendies.""  I interrupted, ""Look if you ain't full of shit, you know I'm really trying to see Rhonda so spit it out future me and say what you gotta say.""  He turned grim, like I'd pissed on his boots.  ""I'll give you one piece of advice.""  ""What""  ""Buy Hertz.""

An explaination of CACC's accounting methods courtesy of [Matthew Greenberg - @greenycapital over on Twitter](https://twitter.com/greenycapital/status/1271197048574967808):  ""Over the next few weeks I’ll be rolling out some threads on CACC as we approach the end of what could be a company altering quarter. This is the first of those threads, and it is going to be about “level-yield” and “effective yield” interest method accounting. Historically “level-yield” and “effective yield” amortization have been used primarily as ways of, in the most accurate way possible, reflecting interest earned on a bond purchased or sold at a discount to fair value. The system works like this:  A purchaser (or seller) of a discount bond records a loans receivable (loan payable) amount on the balance sheet equal to the $ paid (received) for that bond. Over time, that bonds value is increased such that at maturity, the bond’s book value equals its par value. This can be done through straight line amortization, but doing so does not take into account the compounding interest rate an investor earns/company pays by buying/selling that bond. Level-yield and effective yield accounting do by calculating a YTM for the bond and amortizing. By applying that YTM to the book value of the bond to calculate interest income/expense. As the BV  grows towards par value, the interest income/expense grows proportionally, thus more accurately representing the true yield the investor/seller receives/pays over the bonds life.  CACC uses level/effective-yield in a different way. Pre-CECL, when CACC purchased a loan from a dealer they record a receivables balance equal to the advance paid for the loan and an “accretable yield” balance equal to the company’s expected collections net of the advance. The amortization of that “accretable yield” was done by applying the level-yield to the loan’s carrying value the same way it’s done in a typical bond amortization. The problem? This practice does not accurately reflect the reality of CACC’s business the way it does for others.  CACC purchases a loan for their purchase program with $200 of contractual payments owed over 5 years for $100. They expect to collect $150 of that amount. They record a loan receivable balance of $100, and an accretable yield balance of $50 to be amortized over those 5 years. They assume $30 of payments in each year and calculate a “level-yield” of 15.2% to maturity. In the first period, CACC will record accretion of $15.22 no matter how much they actually collect from the borrower. They then net out the remainder of the collections as principal. If there’s a collection shortfall, CACC takes a provision equal to that amount (even if expected collections over the loan’s life don’t change), and adjusts the accretable yield to equal (AY at start of period 1 - accretion + provisions + net change in forecast). At that point, CACC recalculates their expected collections and adjusts the yield. If collections were in-line, and expectations are stable the rate will be the same. If forecasts were raised, they will raise the level-yield to account for this; if not THEY DONT CHANGE THE YIELD That’s right, CACC uses the higher of the initial YTM and the calculated level yield. So let’s just assume collections go exactly as expected. What happens? CACC recognizes accretion of $15.22 in Y1, $12.97 in Y2, $10.93 in Y3, $7.47 in Y4 and $3.41 in Y5. Meanwhile, they recognize principal of $14.78, $17.03, $19.07, $22.53, $26.59 respectively in each of those years. See the problem yet? CACC is collecting $30 in each period, but recognizing $.51/$1 of collections in year 1, and $.11/$1 in year 5. Meanwhile, their credit risk grows (cars depreciate in value, so the underlying value of the collateral is declining even as contractual payments stay stable). So, CACC recognizes 56% of a loan’s accretable yield in years 1 and 2, but only 31% of the principal. It’s a mismatch. That’s fine if it was the other way around, but as is, CACC is recognizing revenue it has not earned yet. If collections come in lower than expected after those two years, they have to take a larger write-down on receivables because they overstated loan income in the first 2 yrs  So that brings us to today, where COVID is ravaging CACC’s loan book. They are seeing collections come in below expectations, when they’ve already taken more in loan income  than they will earn over the life of the loan. This leads to massive provisions for losses. Meanwhile, the loans that are performing as expected are effectively non-performing loans, with receivables on the BS earning substantially less in accretable yield/dollar collected. Add on top of that the impact of CECL, which makes new originations a NI negative in year one. And CACC is essentially in earnings hell. Usually, they grow their loan book to offset the fact that all loan vintages are now earning less/$ collected than they did the year before as a result of level-yield, but with CECL that growth will be NI negative. The company is going to do their best to keep non-CECL provisions as low as possible, but given the amount of accretion they’ve pulled forward, it’s going to be very hard to do that. How are lenders going to feel with revenue collapsing and provisions growing? Not good. Especially the lenders and senior secured bond holders, who are junior to the ABS holders in a liquidation event. The company had $25 mil of non-restricted cash on the BS at the end of Q1. I would not want to be a creditor watching earnings collapse even as collections stabilize.  That’s it for this thread, will be back with more periodically as I see fit over the next few weeks. Feel free to reach out with questions, I know it’s complicated and Twitter isn’t the best platform for this, but it’s the best option I’ve got.""  TL:DR - Short / Put CACC to oblivion."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1270547|public|confidence|self|DD on the fall of Credit Acceptance Corp.|0.0|[]|0.84|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7kdr3/dd_on_the_fall_of_credit_acceptance_corp/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'bg0Wxr1gfHjGgYBRfFx37QFnKr4Cw0dY7dbVCbw3-aA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=936b7d9f94c515f990a59cf20e52457522ccc3f7', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e0944e61bd71d60af5781f89001c5d8e12a81d8', 'width': 216}, {'height': 179, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d89e9821e5437fb08006f59a6f6dbf29b314fff7', 'width': 320}, {'height': 359, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=013e4a0bf6fda238f37575f23b789dc02b5f404a', 'width': 640}, {'height': 539, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0db1922fb2460087777f78f6d49bdeaff014a59b', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d0fbb91ba4ef958e277e6f1a3335257b478db9b', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 787, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jo0BZgxY1yUDMtMUP_CGKFs5YP0Vk6-pdt6T7HtDb-0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=40064b8d8df2515f51eaeb5c7ad110b2dcf1bf64', 'width': 1400}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-06-12|FORD

I did manage to fix up my portfolio when things when to shit in March but still not enough of what I would like to see.  It wasn’t until I found you guys that I now know what I want to do.   After today I have $1.9k in stocks and ETFs. I will never be my girlfriend’s only boyfriend and most importantly, never see a Ford Raptor at this rate.  Any serious advice with a side of WSB humor to learn options please? YouTube links, books, websites, tips, what not to do, anything please.   I’m just a broke university student that wants to finally have a “Gain” posting on here and get the, “congrats now fuck off!” Maybe want that a little bit more than the Raptor tbh.  Thank you all for coming to my Ted talk.  I hope to hear soon from you all.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1269582|public|confidence|self|options trading. help.|0.0|[]|0.5|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7a6i8/options_trading_help/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-06-12|FORD

In my Pueblo I'm known as El Wiki because I'm mother fucking Wikipedia.

Basically I'm saying to call your fucking shots on NET, PYPL, Facebook, and KSU. If you don't you're so fucking dumb on so many levels. Like I'm basically giving you money right now for free and you're not taking it? You are fucking stupid as FUCK for not doing that   These companies print fucking cash like no tomorrow at the fundamental level. Institutions put their money over here because they deal with actual real life shit like people's retirements and not your fucking little dickshit option. You can take advantage of this desperation for investor confidence.   - call PayPal not Square. Square is for millenials who are all poor as fuck and for retarded Zoomers who are afraid to talk to people that hold responsibilities like bankers and tax filers. PayPal is what the rest of the world uses and scrapes discounts on Amazon transactions. PayPal is an actual business ran by business people. Not some retarded wannabe tech celebrity   - call FB. This guy is like 12 years old and the world fucking hates him but still uses his product like coke addicted fuck boys across all age groups. Not only that, he is building a supermassive e-commerce platform so he will literally be rolling in hundreds of billions of dollars across India, Mexico, and the whole fucking world.  - call KSU. USMCA goes into effect July 1st you lazy idiots. The heavy materials, energy, and industrials relationship between Texas and Monterrey will only continue to grow dramatically in the upcoming months. Yes Tesla, Ford, GM, and all your fucking little EV parts will be exchanged between Mexico and the US.  - call NET. China can't build shit for themselves so they need Americans to come in and build their shit for real. This is why they fucking love Cloudflare filtered out web infrastructure to deal with their American Big Tech problem. Cloudflare lets them build some crazy shit out at scale.

Today I made close to $15k (edit: now its closer to $19k)  &amp;#x200B;  During the first week of may I was looking at calls for my birthday on all of the biggest stocks (August 21). When I looked at BRK.B I noticed that the $185 call was floating around $4.00 a contract. (The shares were around $170 a share) I'm holding onto the contracts and I'll realize it on my birthday for a nice happy birthday to me giving me some nice tendies. I started my journey with $1000 and a dream. I opened my first trading account on Christmas of 2018 at the low of the crash. I put my savings that I had earned over the summer and let it grow. I quickly made a little over $2000 by the next summer. After returning to school in September I wanted to increase my trading, and turned on margin trading. I daytraded it from September to January and grew it to about $5K. And dumped it all into a put on Tesla: one $800 put and two $765 puts. It was flying up and it was about $900 a share and climbing. The put expired on 3/6. Fortunately, unfortunately, the pandemic hit and tesla crashed to about $700 when my put exercised. I held the 2 $765 puts until the expiration date and sold the $800 put on Feb. 28th for a profit of $9,920 or 358% (I'll add a pic below that I took before it was sold). I sold the two other puts on the day of expiration for $12.5K. I showed my grandpa my returns and he gave me a loan for $200k to trade. I invested back into the market at the bottom of the V recovery within 5% above the bottom. I took my tendies and the loan money and I've also been selling at the money cash covered puts. I've been wheeling the stocks that were exercised and used it to have buy-ins lower than the market was. All of the stocks that have been exercised has drove me to get about $15K in profits today alone. Since I started writing I've made $3k. Rather than YOLO-ing profits from YOLOs we should be autists here but not 100% autist. I'll put a poll as to what I should do with the profits from my Berkshire call tendies, I'll hold the contract for now probably until expiration unless the autists here have a different opinion.  Thank you for your support! The YOLOing knowledge I've gained from this subreddit has helped me pay off my car and part of my student loan (I didn't but I have my gains realized in cash in the account to sell cash covered puts)  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Sorry for not attaching the pics I took.......thanks for pointing it out (for my privacy I hid my user and full portfolio) here they are:  Also my portfolio is 45% invested in TSLA, 10% in AMZN, 10% in Ford, 10% in MSFT, and the rest is between the other stocks I have (pic included below)  &amp;#x200B;  [$800 call on TSLA right before I sold

The company is most likely being bought out by Microsoft, but it’s possible another company like Amazon or Tesla could buy them. MicroVision sent Ford a HUD projection system prototype in the very early 2000s. Who knows what will happen. The stock has been crunched between .94 and 1.07 for several trading sessions. If you watch Level 2 closely you will see they are suppressing the share price while supporting it at $1. I know this sort of situation doesn’t necessarily attract options traders, but the opportunity here for an accumulation and hold play is strong. There was a fake Seeking Alpha article that claimed MVIS was under investigation by the SEC. There’s a lot of manipulation happening and that really makes me want to buy even more shares. (I’m buying 100K shares SHIP Monday in case there’s a gap so I can actually buy more shares of MVIS) Just recently, a new addition to the MicroVision board was announced: [Dr. Mark B. Spitzer](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-announces-addition-dr-mark-123010583.html)  “Dr. Spitzer is an experienced technology innovator with expertise in eyewear- and head-mounted systems, micro-displays, imaging optics for AR and VR, and photovoltaics. He has a strong record of inventive entrepreneurship with 70 issued US patents, over 86 publications and leadership positions with ground-breaking technology companies. His experience in technology development and management includes serving as Principal Scientist at Kopin Corporation in the early 1990s where he led DARPA-funded development of micro-displays for military head-mounted systems. In 1996 Dr. Spitzer founded the MicroOptical Corporation (eventually renamed Myvu), where as CEO he launched several industrial and consumer eyewear-based AR products.  In 2012 Dr. Spitzer joined Google X as Director of Operations for Glass, and later moved to the VR team at Google where he helped build expertise in VR hardware design. He retired in 2017.”  Also VISL would be a good call. They had a satellite appear on screen in action at NASA on the Space X broadcast.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1243398|public|confidence|self|Sold 20K shares MARK. Bought 100K VISL.

But how high will Ford go?  Why I think Ford will be mooning over the next few weeks.  1. Even though its been a meme, it seems this market follows memes more than anything else. So it may be very true that with all of these Ford police vehicles being damaged in the riots, it would in fact cause more orders from the local PD's to Ford.   2. Ford is becoming a 'trend' brand car in China. Its very rare to see an American branded car in China, due to imports, etc, but since Ford started a venture there, their sales jumped over 130% from last year. For some reason Chinese people adore americans. If you go there, they will literally want to take pictures of you just because you are white.   3. Most importantly, with Robinhood users soaring since the lockdown came into place, there are a lot of millenials trying to dabble with stocks. Not only is Ford one of the most common stocks for new traders to buy, but just the other day Ford put out a statement condemning George Floyd's death and spoke out against racism. This will only draw the attention to Ford more for early investors and drive the price up.

So as the title says I am bullish on GM coming out of the crisis, as we are reopening many sectors of the market have recovered and are starting to do pre-epidemic share prices again. I believe GM is best poised from a financial standpoint as it seems undervalued right now. Here is a link to GM current financial overview on Finviz.  https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d[GM financial overview](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)  And here is a link to their competition Ford who many on this sub know already went on a brief rally after earnings.  [Ford financial overview ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F)  Fiat- Chrysler are in the midst of a merger and are seemingly struggling to come to terms, as well as taking out more debt. They also have more European exposure which is not as good since several of those countries are still struggling to reopen.  Also most of GM sales come from China, USA which are both mostly reopened or in phase 1. [GM sales by country](https://www.statista.com/statistics/304367/vehicle-sales-of-general-motors-by-country/)  Finally, car sales are nowhere near as bad as what analysts thought they would be as Barron’s explains here: [Car Sales Data](https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/car-sales-stocks-auto-parts-dealerships-light-trucks-51589464899) The Detroit 3 are planning on reopening factories on Monday and sending all the unhappy workers back, in. [Detroit reopening](https://news.yahoo.com/amphtml/eyes-detroit-automakers-prepare-slow-113000251.html)  Conclusion: GM has healthier financials then the other Detroit 3 and are reopening their factories Monday.

I averaged into SPY puts 4/21-4/23 as we rose from 272 up to 283. I expected the channel to break downward. It didn't. I put $4000 into this play. Last Monday I was down over $1700. Last Wednesday saw the current max loss, down $2300. Worse than the money, there was the reality that when I decided to put money into this play, I candidly didn't see a breakout to the positive, and being wrong is not my favorite.  When a play breaks down, the important thing is to reassess. I don't believe in diamond hands, in life the only value in looking back is to learn from the past before turning forward and making the best of what sits in front of you.  Each day is a coin flip. I called it wrong. When we broke channel, I had to re-evaluate. When I set the play in motion, it was primarily due to the channel compounding with critical earnings announcements and the FED meeting. What kept me in the play was the lack of news that changed my macro vibe, and the back of the week Amazon earnings call.  # Still Holding, Still Down  Things went to crap, but we tested 292+, got a giant red candle as we closed 4/29, set a high of 296+ after hours, before crashing into our 4/30 open. The bears are driving this week, but it's unclear to me how much momentum they have.  Earnings calls are still bullish. Q1 wasn't great. Q2 who cares priced in. Q3 ... 'murica! I believe that narrative a total fallacy. Q3 will not turn the way the market hoped, neither will Q4, nor 2021 for that matter. Yet, all that matters for this play is right now. The market is forward looking, and there isn't a ton of bull news to counter all the bear straw being chucked on our friendly camel. But .. I don't know that I believe this downtrend is a capitulation by bulls, I am extremely worried that there's another test in the 285-295 range coming.

Truth is, I'm not stupid enough to tell you I know where we're headed. We broke a key resistance point in Sunday futures. [SV has terrific volume profiles](https://twitter.com/sep_var/status/1257070583738544134?s=20) and has keyed on 2790 as the number to watch for tomorrow's open. Let's revisit last our prior channel:  [Well hello again](https://preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52924e71474605f88f123d8f0ceaa12747e4315)  The challenge with going up when we think it'll go down is that we create solid supports as we retrace. Each support eats momentum, and I can't make up my mind for the short term on if we a) bounce off 274-277 and test upwards again or b) break the channel's support and test into the 260's.  Given my lack of confidence in short term direction, I've already started looking for hedges and plays that can help me protect myself as I watch for a need to exit. I candidly don't know exactly how I'll play this to it's end. But I can tell you the first action I'll take. To revisit where I have allocated my $4000: 14.62% allocated to 5/29 220p, 45.14% to 6/30 220p, and 40.25% to 9/18 220p.  My 5/29 position is currently down an encouraging 76.76% at market close Friday. I have very little interest in continuing to hold it, theta will burn what little is left to the ground. I want to see where futures land in the morning, then barring the unforeseen, I'll set a stop limit order to dump the position.  For now, I'm not looking to abandon the 6/30 or 9/18 positions. I may take the remaining 5/29 position if it stops out and look to average 6/30 down. With any luck, we drill until reality hits and everything prints.  For now, the coach drew a play he believed in, everyone practiced it, he called it in the game, the defense covered it perfectly, the QB scrambled towards the sideline and everyone went into scramble drill mode. What happens next? Flip a coin. Watch it all unfold, and react with intention.  I'll post updates as time allows and the week progresses."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1168094|public|confidence|self|The Normie Playbook: Wait ... is this happening?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2zbu/the_normie_playbook_wait_is_this_happening/|some_ads|7.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'PLI7u0ZqPO41PJraRUQ1KU65GR30W3QG5Kv0O1Bk8q8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-RI-qS_QDHP0Bki8Ps2LrQgDzvO7dhmqXzZNimheD2o.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c445f694c04185d56eb7d42c0c3fac658ce7bc0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-RI-qS_QDHP0Bki8Ps2LrQgDzvO7dhmqXzZNimheD2o.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f841f92d86be9669ecbf1ab7f9eac14e2c8cd7a0', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-RI-qS_QDHP0Bki8Ps2LrQgDzvO7dhmqXzZNimheD2o.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ebc56533567973f15f6158d1c2326490fec713', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-RI-qS_QDHP0Bki8Ps2LrQgDzvO7dhmqXzZNimheD2o.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5e92567acc1ca32ddf577ba34731072b1c2ca7', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 380, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/-RI-qS_QDHP0Bki8Ps2LrQgDzvO7dhmqXzZNimheD2o.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=02862ee9770deab8733c5e4ba9bd6fde1642ca6f', 'width': 760}, 'variants': {}}]}|{'m45ucf3bpnw41': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'm45ucf3bpnw41', 'm': 'image/jpg', 'p': [{'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m45ucf3bpnw41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12e686c37f73db9f3de2c6ea9c8dcb52804e1ef8', 'x': 108, 'y': 80}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m45ucf3bpnw41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cb3556ade185bf16199cb348a95f66ae45e507c', 'x': 216, 'y': 160}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m45ucf3bpnw41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d8445695b4efb5dfdecbe59b6068e8e60bdde4e', 'x': 320, 'y': 237}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/m45ucf3bpnw41.jpg?width=541&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57efa8870adc9b2d9e28f552d1c372699f76d7bb', 'x': 541, 'y': 402}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'qwowmbzcpnw41': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'qwowmbzcpnw41', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8f8d01869930c922db487c05e165d02602bd98', 'x': 108, 'y': 42}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0650d6b8c290a78777e683e342ca58e20682111', 'x': 216, 'y': 84}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04c4c56514921d091eadeb97c058f6398150af77', 'x': 320, 'y': 124}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0755bc3c83876645b18938896bf6641894e44f2f', 'x': 640, 'y': 249}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4358a93366aacf14568f084d11d1d15ffcf16ad', 'x': 960, 'y': 374}, {'u': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cc18ea902aa5a070bb17eb651d05d5780704d01', 'x': 1080, 'y': 420}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52924e71474605f88f123d8f0ceaa12747e4315', 'x': 1193, 'y': 465}, 'status': 'valid'}}|||||||||||2020-05-04|FORD

The reality is that this pandemic and global shutdown is going to boost the hell out of major corporations by reducing the value of legacy companies like Ford and GE to the point that they’re reasonably purchasable, and bleeding out small companies to the point that they go out of business permanently and their market niches become accessible to big corps. By using private banks to subsidize bailout loans, the feds intentionally fuck over small businesses. Banks are extremely hesitant to greenlight these loans because they know that more than likely the business will declare bankruptcy. With larger corps, this is a far less likely scenario which prioritizes their loans. Small businesses will continue to bleed out all Q2 and Q3 and will be bought out or have their market niches filled by larger companies, substantially increasing their value in the long run. Value will become much more consolidated by the end of this crisis which may last until spring or summer next year as a vaccine will take months to get approved, and the logistics of producing/shipping billions will take another few months. This is also under the assumption there’s no major mutations that makes the virus as genetically diverse and incurable as the flu.   TL;DR: stonks are gonna explode as this virus wears on. Remember that major shareholders base their stocks’ values on projections as far as ten years in the future. These fear-based selloffs we’ve been seeing are just speed bumps for speculators.

Chief Executive Elon Musk is close to getting a windfall that would dwarf any payday for star Silicon Valley executives as the electric-car maker predicts it could reach a key milestone within months.  As MarketWatch reported in January, as part of a performance-award agreement in Musk’s 2018 compensation package, the Tesla TSLA, -2.62% CEO stands to receive options to purchase shares if Tesla reaches certain benchmarks, an important one being a market capitalization averaging $100 billion for six months.  Tesla’s market value is currently at $143 billion, nearly seven times the market value of Ford Motor Co. F, +3.38% and four times that of General Motors Co. GM, +0.46% The six-month average is around $97 billion.  Related: Tesla stock is riding high as investors wait to hear effects of coronavirus  Tesla predicted that it will hit that $100 billion market-cap milestone within the next two months, “if the value of Tesla’s closing stock price continues near the levels seen in late April 2020,” the company said in a filing Tuesday.  After the Tesla board certifies the $100 billion market cap average, then Musk would have the option to buy about 1.7 million shares at $350.02 a share. Selling them at Tuesday’s prices would mean a paper profit around $725 million for Musk.  By comparison, Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. disclosed last week that Chief Executive Sundar Pichai’s total compensation for 2019 topped $280 million thanks to stock awards tied to his promotion to chief executive of the entire company.  Tesla shares have shown resilience amid the economic destruction caused by the coronavirus, even as San Francisco Bay Area authorities have extended through the end of May a regional shelter-in-place order that has kept businesses, including Tesla’s sole U.S. car-making plant, shuttered since late March.  The shares have gained 85% so far this year, contrasting with losses of 11% and 15% for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 0.08% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, 0.28%  That outperformance holds in a 12-month comparison as well, with Tesla shares up 230% while the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.4% and the Dow lost 9%. On Feb. 19, Tesla’s stock reached a record closing high of $917.42.  Tesla is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday, with investors keeping an eye out for any changes on Tesla’s goal to sell more than half a million vehicles in 2020.

Changed my mind when I received some nice comments lmao.  To preface: Yea I'm borderline insane.  Ok Wallstreetbets.  here goes nothing. . .  &amp;nbsp;  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqgre/itll_soon_be_apparent_that_the_us_is_going_to/   &gt;I saw that post made on wsb, I think I linked it somewhere actually, and it made me pretty happy that my claims were being substantiated by someone within academia independently. If what he claims is true, and the IMHE model is, as I have heard myself, simple curve fitting. I find that pathetic; it can be done on python linear regression modules in a couple of minutes.   I recently looked through one of the most recent models produced by Morgan Stanley (I don’t have an exact date but my friend acquired it sometime during the weekend), I suppose I can point out in detail which part of the current models I hate the most. It’s everything after the top-- which I think will be fairly accurate:   Too many assumptions are being made on containment that get egregiously worse on the way down. Each inaccuracy from the top down build on one another creating a giant avalanche of error. It certainly doesn’t help that the predictions closer to the bottom become very quickly, much more difficult. Alright here’s the graph and I’ll provide some of my personal commentary as well as expectations.   &amp;nbsp;  **Where the next wave of models might go wrong.** (Notice: I purposely didn't use 'When')  &amp;nbsp;  https://imgur.com/a/GhiQZgh   &amp;nbsp;  0 : The top. This is going to be fairly accurate with the current data. Might still be a little off even.   1: Initial dropoff. Wishful thinking at best. They’re still assuming ideal conditions for such a sharp dropoff. Last time I checked we didn’t have any mandatory/enforced lockdowns to warrant this steep of an initial dropoff nor the will to. Also when has anything related to testing been on schedule? Is the virus suppose to go away with the heat? It’s not. Ideal. Conditions.   2:  Road to containment. It’s starting to get bullshit. Google+Apple colab is op-in optional, what I'd guess &lt;30% which won’t be significant at all. Everyone still remembers Snowden’s warnings in the back of their minds about a surveillance state. We’re not South Korea. Even Singapore got put into lockdown recently despite its initial success against the virus. An un-containable virus is not going away without drastic measures. Our government officials have demonstrated as much that they are not willing to resort to said measures. Their reactions reflect the feelings of their constituents-- we also hate following rules that infringe on our own privacy and freedoms; the country has to date only been told to stay at home-- even kids won’t listen, why would adults? As far as I see it, the risk is worth the reward. Without compelling reason to, people are not going to change their habits of going out and give up their social lives overnight. Humans are inherently social creatures. Furthermore:  Nobody in their right minds, unless they’re forced to, is going to stay at home for over a full month, especially not Americans. If 1. relied on 10 things going right, 2. relies on a magnitude higher, 100.    3: Containment. Is this some type of fairy tale? This virus has not been contained anywhere yet. There’s too many things wrong with this. It’s not disappearing by August. And what’s to say a 2nd wave of infections is gonna wait conveniently months after the first wave and not start before the 1st wave is over? What about a possible 3rd 4th wave? What if that makes the 1st wave never stop? Why only 2? Why are there periods with 0 cases of the virus in this graph? That alone makes me want to tear it up. If there’s any cases, there’s going to be a lot; we know that much. It’s not going away without a vaccine. I don’t even know why they had the audacity to put a 2nd wave anywhere on this fucking graph without putting asterisks everywhere. Might as well buy a lotto ticket. This part of the graph is about as accurate as winning a jackpot or finding a miracle cure. Did they superimpose China’s graph for this part?  Their entire biotechnology research team should be axed for using China’s pandemic data as legitimate data-points, ridiculous.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;I’m not providing any evidence. The evidence is everywhere. I’m rambling. But I’m more coherent then whoever was drunk enough to green-light these graphs without the blatant intention of misleading the public. They might as well have drawn a straight line down from the peak to 0. If the virus was going to magically go away anyways, why not all at once? Why wait? There’s no room for any sort of setback for this graph. The real thing is going to be drawn out by many months at least. Anyways. . .  &amp;nbsp;  0 &gt;&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; 2 &gt;&gt; 3 in terms of difficulty to predict as well as number of underlying conditions that have to go favorably or on schedule. We have not been on schedule on anything so far. Why do we expect the federal government and state governments to suddenly start working together? They’re currently still outbidding each other on medical supplies. There’s too many assumptions for this to be a proper model. Why are they still modeling Covid after previous diseases?   &gt;My personal feelings: I don’t think we’re returning work in any way shape or form until, at the very earliest, fall. And that’s me being overly optimistic. We might not be able to return back at all, except in small quantities, to be perfectly honest. Any Covid graph that looks easy on the eyes and clean should be illegal. It might as well be drawn free-handed. I would really like to know how these things graphs are generated with no evidence. This graph doesn’t even deserve to be called an estimate. It’s so incredibly lazy and bullshit. *It's because it doesn't matter. They can always adjust it later on, just like the rest of their ""forecasts"" on the economy.*  Any actual estimate would have to take over 1000 pages to look at hundreds of moving parts/components and verifying every underlying assumption. They most likely procrastinated really hard and had around 10 if I had to guess. I bet 5 of them relied on empty-nothing burger promises being rolled out/executed properly by our model government, and the other 5 relied on faulty data from China’s “miracle containment story” or low number case behavior from role-model countries, Taiwan, South Korea, ect.. It ain’t their first rodeo. We’re the noobs this time, not them. Bad graphs are easy to make if you’re allowed to make endless assumptions with little to no care. Good graphs are not, because you can’t afford to. It’s not their job to make good graphs. This *thing* will never be fully contained, no matter how much we test, without a vaccine.   End of ultra speculative section.   &gt;The graph was so bad I struggled to write this section. I could’ve cleaned every up and made it sound nice. But I’m honestly flabbergasted. I’m incredulous. They can’t be serious. Why am I taking something seriously that wasn't meant to be? This begs the question . . .  &amp;nbsp;  When might these new models break?   Watch how the peak forms and as it goes into the initial dropoff. If it’s not a steep dropoff you can bet your asses they’re going back to the drawing board soon. It’s a weird getup where any changes especially near the top of the pyramid as it’s coming downwards will only amplify the issues with these forecasts.   &amp;nbsp;  **Actually none of anything above this section matters. It's the wrong frame of mind. But it makes good practice for myself.**  &gt;Sorry to disappoint you. Well then that was a total waste of time wasn’t it? Not really, but we shouldn’t care have to care when forecasts turn sour because they don’t matter anymore. These graphs are not meant to be accurate. I’m sure that they’re going to be making their moves well before this happens again. But it’s an important exercise to see where they’re at. It’s an unspoken agreement between all the firms. They’re buying time for *something*. Even if this was meant to be internal and passed around like hot cakes it’s to make their average employees believe in the Cinderella story, that they’re working for a better cause. But make no mistake, there’s some super secret restricted model/predictions only seen by a couple higher-ups most likely. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess here, but it’s not going to be nearly as pretty. Or is there? No that can't possibly be!  We arrive then at the seemingly obvious conclusion:  *The Fed/gov/banks must be conspiring against us. Their actions are dangerous to the American people.* But . . .  &amp;nbsp;  **This conclusion can also be considered close-minded and should be relinquished in my opinion.**  &amp;nbsp;  I for one, am guilty guilty of thinking like this not to long ago-- actually when the fed announced they were going to buy junk bonds that was my initial reaction. But after looking back, reality is often much more elegant and not the least crude or brute-forced-- electrical engineers reading this will know exactly what I'm talking about. . . as will many others. So, why then? If. . .  They are not conspiring against anyone. Then. . .  What are they buying time for?  &amp;nbsp;  **Absolutely nothing.**   &gt;Sorry to disappoint you. A crash is detrimental to them too; especially after the restrictions put on banks after the last financial crisis. The fed, the gov, the shitty graphs, QE,  and every single god damn revision they've made to their economic forecasts. All of it is done to prevent panic, relax expectations, and shank the natural crash that would've otherwise occurred before it could run. They’re doing their best to buy time and delay the downturn because that’s all that they can do. There doesn’t have to be a conspiracy theory. There doesn’t have to be brilliant reason. Sometimes the best explanation is the most obvious one.  Fed buying anything and everything? They’re trying to prevent certain firms, that are leveraged to the tits with junk, from blowing up and causing a chain reaction. In their view, that’s the best way for them to protect the financial system and serve the American people. However, It also happens to be the easy way out, the other path less traveled, despite being the obvious choice to the rest of us, is unknown, uncertain, and untested. It’s scary, and it should be; because it's never been done before. They’re human too, and it’s easier to make easy decisions as one (especially for a bunch of boomers).  &gt; ok Boomer. And yes, to answer the obvious, they won't be held accountable because when it's our turn to deal with this shit they'll suddenly pretend be senile. *Go figure.*  &amp;nbsp;  Then why did I say when we switched to these more drawn out forecasts it’d matter?  Because it happens to cancel the U-V shaped recovery story or the virus “magically” going away narrative currently being preached by the media. That’s the only reason why I cared about this current revision. It's big. That's it. There is going to be a relatively large base case shift or fundamental change because of it. I don’t think anybody should put in the mental effort to care about how firms make models and tweak them after they’re finished switching and started publishing their “revised” bullshit this time around. That or I just like being lazy and ignoring things I don’t think matter anymore or will soon become irrelevant. Either way, soon we can all forget about virus models/forecasts because they’ll only be a worthless distraction and serve as comedic relief soon.  &amp;nbsp;  However. Back to the current timeline. . .  &amp;nbsp;  Why does matter is that if these new models are getting passed around internally?  It means they will soon go for public release in a week or so. And we'll have our promised downturn. I hate shitty graphs.  &amp;nbsp;  **The concluding discussion:**  &amp;nbsp;  Back to my favorite kind of speculation.   &gt;I over-explained graphs that didn’t mean anything in the first place. Then argued for a faulty statement. Kindof like yodeling in space. *Go figure.*   &gt;To balance things out I’m going to be concise about the next part which might be relevant.  &amp;nbsp;   The assumption I’m making: **We won’t breach next fib level.** If we do and don’t get rejected immediately, please proceed to chuck everything I say here out the window. The market will have changed, and I will have had no idea what I’m talking about and we should start to seriously consider buying precious metals.  &amp;nbsp;  * Last week's rally was driven by both fundamental/technical factors but due to the ferocity of the rally we have since diverged, *bigly.* * Notice Monday: money was flooding into strong stocks like Amazon/Netflix/AMD ect.. but shit stocks like Ford/Airlines/Lyft were getting sucked dry. It would appear that MMs are currently positioning for some sort of broader downturn as we continue to go sideways but sorta upwards in the meantime.  * If you think of TA as Sin(), and Fundamental as Cos(), I believe they’re just about to close in on a point of maximum divergence soon. * What happens when they start converging again? idk. you tell me. * If you do TA yourself or follow any number of TA charters, one term that is currently being echoed is “beautiful TA” Why is it considered beautiful? Why are the charts suddenly so clean and elegant? Why were the magic crayons swapped out for an artisan's brush? * Stubborn traders that only look at the fundamentals and complain about the divergence have become blind to a real beauty passing by on the other side. They will continue to lose in the coming weeks. * Last week a wet towel was wrung out once, it is customary to wring a towel a 2nd time to get the remaining water out. * For this reason we are most likely going to follow the TA and complete the ascending wedge for the rest of this week at least. This channel will most likely finish somewhat close to the next fib level. * My base case is an eventual slow, and drawn-out downturn for reasons highlighted in the useless chunks before this section. *It will not be easy to profit off of.* Don’t be tricked: We may enter a downturn soon, but it will be one where Circuit-breakers will most likely be both sparse and scarce in between; likewise the same can be said about VIX spikes. We won’t be seeing a lot of them anytime soon until a crash  occurs in one of the credit-markets in a couple of months. Meanwhile, if they are doing everything in their power to delay whatever they’re trying to prevent, make no mistake, **it will be delayed.** * Prognosis for the next couple of weeks: Gay. 50 shades of it. The elevators are all broken but we might hop off some stairs a couple times; I still think it’s going to be a delayed/drawn-out downturn regardless-- simply because that’s what **they** are trying to do. * Try to daytrade. If you’re long gamma look for short trades. Be a bandit. *Be like water.* Any positions (excluding LEAPS) held for more than a week is going to end up going belly up.   &gt;**We're in a vast ocean, the ocean won't shed a tear when you lose all your investments. There is no such thing as easy money. Be safe in your trades and irl. GLHF**  With that being said, looking back I may sound like I'm against anyone betting on a big drop so i wanted to clarify:  &amp;nbsp;  If you see an opportunity for calls/puts, execute on your intuition. I don't intend to dissuade anyone from making money, but I implore you to have the time-frame in question well thought out ahead of time. There's going to be a lot bullshit happening in between lucrative+volatile time-frames during ""dry-out periods"". Don't be caught in one of these FOMOing. There's money to be made, but it's not going to be as no-brainer as mid-Feb to mid-March, because everybody is expecting it. That's the main purpose of this piece."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1103917|public|confidence|self|Writing on the wall.|1.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1fkpc/writing_on_the_wall/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'nN3dwAGSXZTxTlv2JUuG_kXXhVOdgSFEU-jbuUzHQTE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 63, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94c3c3fce2783f1479bfbb84543f54427ba3a5a6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 126, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=920ab1c70d06546ad88c128656f65af2e5614ea6', 'width': 216}, {'height': 187, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fbbe960e06275f565cccbafe0bb279d8f5f1e36', 'width': 320}, {'height': 375, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a3ba237e9037688ceb59c6a48d16215d2e7215', 'width': 640}, {'height': 563, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6db9156aa48c7870d969f9e54f5e985f6397a38', 'width': 960}, {'height': 634, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=432b5f34a832f5346c005c77d5ac6fb3693a7a4e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 902, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FARsVBurjsOHZyUCDNy7Qwp21c_rAuMl1pzMveIBbSQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9e206a1206f6064d44c0d59844ae1a8fcc44f25c', 'width': 1536}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||1.0|||||||2020-04-14|FORD

Those lessons are:  * Don't do what everyone else is doing, when people are buying sell when people are selling buy * Look for fundamentally sound companies, companies that have a high barrier to entry, and ideally market dominance * Ignore financial news, its too reactionary, pay attention to trends, and the news in general  In early February I started to pay attention to COVID19. I also saw some videos on how infectious the disease was, in addition I saw the drastic measures China took. This deeply concerned me as I knew shut downs as the one China imposed would have massive economic affects. I began to liquidate my positions. I had made very strong gains.  I then heard about the news what happened in Korea and I figured EVENTUALLY this disease would be worldwide, and I figured the longer countries waited to react the worst it'd get. So I started thinking about companies that would do well during COVID19. And here is my list:  * Amazon: People will still need products, more and more will  turn to eCommerce people still need products. * Netflix: I figure people will need something to do, this could be a good investment * Clorox: consumer brand that deals effectively with the disease. * 3m they produce a lot of PPE (honestly this wasn't my smartest play) * Kroger: I figured restaurants would be shut down however groceries will be in higher demand  I stayed away from healthcare stocks as I wasn't confident which one would benefit or which one would drop  Stocks I'm considering as this virus progresses  * Boeing: Its an American staple and it will be bailed out. * Ford/Chrysler/GM: Those are staples of the American economy who have taken big hits, they aren't going go anywhere. * Best Buy: They turned themselves around and have great leadership, obviously as consumer spending took a hit they went down but I'm confident in their ability to survive. * Expedia: Its ultimately a tech company that deals in Travel obvious due to COVID 19 they lost a ton in terms of value but I think  as we recover people will be looking to get out and travel. Since they are a tech company I'm confident in their ability to rebound. Although I'm sure many travel/hotel related companies may not survive, I'm confident Expedia will bounce back * American Airlines/Delta: They are American staples and even if they need to bailed out they will be. And one things resume to normal they'll bounce back and I feel as if they could be a good value.  My plan is in the next few weeks to buying positions in those above stocks. And hold.     I've made quite a bit of money on this outbreak by positioning myself, and truth be told a lot of its due to reddit.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1098481|public|confidence|self|A lesson my grandpa taught my dad, who then taught me and how it paid off in a global pandemic|1.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0cj60/a_lesson_my_grandpa_taught_my_dad_who_then_taught/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-04-13|FORD

The answer to this is yes, but not really.  If you listened to the full statement from Powell and read the full document on policy implementations, you would realize the Fed is NOT buying all corporate high yield debt. What they're trying to do is save fallen angels. Specifically, the policy is to ""expand its bond-buying program to include debt that was investment-grade rated as of March 22 but was later downgraded to no lower than BB-, or three levels into high yield.""  Source:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/fed-unleashes-fresh-steps-for-as-much-as-2-3-trillion-in-aid  A good example of this would be a company like Ford. With their recent downgrade to junk bond status, they wouldn't be qualified to be in the investment grade purchases of the Fed. But now, a company like Ford, who admittingly wasn't a great company in the first place but not bad, gets the Fed's assistance.  This is just one example of why HYG really shouldn't have shot up to bazooka high levels. Some of the companies in HYG will be given assistance. Some.

A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.  I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.  I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-""   ""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.  ""Huh?"" I respond, confused.  ""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.  ""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.  ""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""  Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.  ""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.  I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.  Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""  I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.  ""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.  The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

Our country’s historical corporate juggernauts are burdened by unimaginable debt (thank you for pointing this out, Fuzzy), and our economy was shut down so fast, some business owners still think they will be opening up again in a few weeks.  This pandemic is a mess. Long before Bill Gates gave his infamous 2015 Ted Talk, George Bush read a book about the 1918 Spanish Flu during his presidency. It terrified him, and he used his influence to create a plan for when the next pandemic would strike. He invested billions into the project, and even did “germ games.” Well, after H1N1 happened with a .2% death rate, the supplies failed to be replaced (thanks Obama) and the project was put on the back burner by both of the following presidents. As a result, we have found ourselves made into scared little bitches holed up in our houses, too scared to even go on a walk. The “tests” we are using today are inaccurate up to 50% of the time. When Dr. Scarf tells you that only 90% of all tests are positive, she is failing to mention that false negatives are a real problem. Now maybe this wouldn’t be such a big deal, but these shitty tests are also being used around the world. And there aren’t even enough of the tests to actually monitor the whole disease. It would actually be more accurate to think about the tests as a sample size of a study (positive rates / total tests) than an actual representation of how many people are infected in our country.  This brings me to the number of deaths. Did you know that France only counts a Covid-19 death if it happens in a hospital? In our own glorious country, if someone dies from a respiratory failure but failed to get tested first, they are counted as a death due to respiratory failure and not Covid-19. Now, if tests were abundant and universally produced 15 minute results, this would not be a problem. But as you may have already deduced, this is a major problem. You see, it is reasonable to conclude that while the total cases and deaths appear to be going down in all of our official records, the REAL number of cases and deaths is still increasing exponentially.  In a question: What if the datasets we have are only capable of growing linearly, while the virus is growing exponentially?  You may ask yourself, “So what if the world is fukkkk? These companies have crazy amounts of money and can get more thanks to unlimited liquidity. Recession is cancelled LOL.” This is fine and all, but have you happened to read Fuzzy’s posts on corporate bonds? To summarize his absolute brilliance, a lot of companies that you never think about have been issuing bonds to pay their debts. When bonds come due, they just issue more bonds to pay for it. Fast forward a decade, and you have companies like Ford, where they made just 50 million in net revenue but also just got downgraded in their lending score to junk bonds. I’m not nearly smart enough to put all the pieces together, but their massive debt load with brand new higher interest rates is about to sodomize their measly remaining profits. And this is just the beginning. Less business from people staying home means more bonds and less equity. I don’t have nearly enough to time to look at every company’s credit agreement, but the ones I have looked at seem really sketchy. Big numbers are coming due in the next 2-3 years, but there is a tiny amount of equity left to leverage.   Small businesses are getting bent over and shown whose really the boss. As a small business owner myself, I thought the whole 10k advance loan you don’t pay back (paid within 3 days of applying), and anything else up to $2 million was a bit of a stretch. And then the PPP loan where you get a massive amount of money forgiven was also announced, and that was just too good as well. But then Mnuchin went on TV and actually said point blank that people will get funded the same day they apply, starting on April 3rd. Well, you can bet your sweet gay ass they fucked this up. Not only did NOBODY get funded (search “SBA” on twitter and it will remind you of searching ""just laid off"") but the banks straight up rebelled. BoA didn’t open applications until halfway through the day, Wells Fargo flipped the bird and said they were only going up to $10 billion in loans (and they had already hit that number), and my own personal bank didn’t even let me apply until this morning. Furthermore, a LOT of people have called SBA, and they are now saying the 10k grant will be based on your number of employees, and your money won’t get there for another 2-3 WEEKS. Oh yeah. This is going exactly according to plan.  So sure, the stocks are trending up right now while the retarded bulls circle jerk each other and fantasize about the “V shaped recovery.” Meanwhile, anyone with a warped gay mind can see the news is fake, the numbers are fake, and the real crash is imminent.

Growth died, value (ex-energy) died and momentum died. If your portfolio's still alive... congrats on your #thetagang tendies &amp; there's still the weekend for Trump to tweet something out to completely screw your ""portfolio"".  With one little tweet on Thursday, Trump got the markets more excited than a teenager discovering porn for the first time:  [Note the words \\""expect\\"" and \\""hope\\""](https://preview.redd.it/82fventtgsq41.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f559ac2cceabaf1822d23f0042d239548af7f432)  Damn if that didn't go and destroy 🌈🐻 in a single tweet. Credit spreads led by shitty e&amp;p's tightened, equities ignored the largest initial jobless claims number ever and crude oil had the largest single day return of all time. Straight up boiler room shit. If market-manipulation weren't illegal, he'd be claiming to have engineered the ""greatest pump of all time""  Except he'd be wrong. That award goes to a little company called Porsche.  **The Squeeze**  Remember 2008? Bear Stearns was bailed out, Lehman was allowed to fail and shit was hitting the fan. GM, Ford and Chrysler were begging for handouts in the middle of the worst auto market in 25 years.  Now if I were to tell you that for a brief period that year, that Volkswagen became the largest company in the world, would you believe me?  [Now those are some serious gainz](https://preview.redd.it/dicd7ff9hsq41.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3249bcd32bfdf68bd4630d69de875d97bb7442db)  For a few brief minutes on October 28th, 2008, the price of Volkswagen stock was up more than 113% in a day, hitting €1,005/share (for you autists, a € is like a $, except when you put it in the bank they take some away from you instead of giving you more) and beating out ExxonMobil to be the largest company in the world (for a couple minutes). This was after the stock had already shot up 93% the day before.  So how did this epic two day squeeze happen? To explain, we have to look back at history, starting with WWII.  **The Part With Hitler**  It was the mid-1930's and Hitler was chomping at the bit to get a chance at a rematch with the US for the title belt. He was doing what he could to boost up the German economy and wanted a car that could rival Ford's. He commissioned Volkswagen to create low-cost transportation for the German people and an up-and-coming engineer by the name of Ferdinand Porsche designed the iconic Beetle.  He became famous for his work and left to start making sports cars on his own. Thus Porsche was born.  **The Part With the Cuckoldry**  Porsche had two kids, a son and a daughter, and the daughter married a dude named Piëch and so the Porsche and Piëch families ended up controlling the Porsche company. Happy ending, right?  *Wrong.*  The Porsche and Piëch families fucking hated each other. The Porsches looked down upon Piëchs because they weren't real Porsches. The Piëchs looked down upon the Porsches because they were weak and cucks. Literally.  [Porsche family tree](https://preview.redd.it/lzc6g7t2isq41.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=034f4283e9a1cfdfa8ddbe1532e00caaee273e92)  Ferdinand Piëch (remember the name... he's important later) had a public affair with his cousin's wife for twelve years and even had two children with her. Can see why the two families hated each other, right?  The families fought about everything and finally, in 1970, decided that no member of the Porsche or Piëch family should work at the family company and that outside managers would run the company. Great, right? Well not for Ferdinand Piëch.  You see... our boy Ferdinand was an up and rising star in the automobile world and was the leading contender to take over as CEO of Porsche. But because of this squabble, he was forced out of the company he was a shareholder of and took at job at Audi, a Volkswagen owned brand. He rose up the ranks and became CEO of Audi in 1988 and CEO of Volkswagen in 1993.  **The First One's Free**  Porsche's long relationship with Volkswagen now spanned three generations. Post-WWII, Porsche relied on Volkswagen more and more as a partner, even to the point of many of their cars essentially being Volkswagen chassis with a Porsche engine.  But there was one issue. Volkswagen was a super low margin company ($125bn in revenue vs $2.2bn net income in 2005) and so as a shitty company, its market cap was only $17bn. Super cheap and open to a hostile takeover (which would've ended this decades old relationship).  The state of Lower Saxony in Germany had held a 20.2% voting block in Volkswagen ever since it was privatized so to prevent any future hostile takeovers of Volkswagen, Porsche really only had to hold a small position. They announced that they were spending $4.2bn for a 18.5% stake in Volkswagen.  **Porsche Goes Autist**  Like each of you autist knows... there's no feeling like clicking that ""buy"" button for the first time. Porsche effectively positioned itself to block any hostile takeover of Volkswagen, but it had now tasted the sweet sweet taste of trading and now wanted more.  It started trading Volkswagen. First by buying a few more shares at a time, then by buying calls. Eventually they were doing exotic structured products trades with investment banks with the underlying being... you guessed it, Volkswagen stocks.  By 2008, Porsche had a 35% equity stake in Volkswagen. It was still selling cars, but like a true autist, it was raking in tendies from trading derivatives on Volkswagen. Of its 2Q profits in 2008, only 20% came from making cars and the rest came from ""hedging transactions"". A true autist.  **Arbitrage**  Listed companies have different ways they can practice shitty corporate governance and screw over their shareholders. One method is to have two different shares of stocks (see $SNAP, $GOOGL) where one class, the ordinary (ords) have voting rights and the preferred (prefs) have a ""guaranteed"" dividend, but no voting rights. Depending on the dividend, important shareholder votes, etc the price action of ords and the prefs may be slightly different day to day, but they're still shares of the same company so they should move in sync over the long run.  [Chart 1 - Candle: Ords, Green: Prefs \[Normalized to 100\] \/\/ Chart 2 - Red: Spread](https://preview.redd.it/b8kqw0r6isq41.png?width=1508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f784d7400ffd0f86296f9d80aa6c64e6db034c16)  In 2008, the candle (Volkswagen ords) and green (Volkswagen pref) lines started moving apart in March and accelerated throughout the year. This got the attention of the guys on Arbitrage desks at hedgies, prop houses.  When you hear ""Arbitrage"" (See also: LTCM), think ""Literally can't go tits up"" desk. They do ""risk free"" trades and this type of trade was perfect.  You see... having a 35% ownership of Volkswagen, Porsche had also announced that it wasn't buying any more shares. So there wasn't any risk of this spread going higher. By buying the prefs (the green line) and shorting the voting right ords (candle), hedgies could eat this spread ""risk-free"". Eventually that spread would come together. By early October 2008, this trade was incredibly popular and short interest on the ords was 12%  **Porsche Goes Full Autist**  On October 26th, 2008, Porsche, in a [press release](https://www.porsche-se.com/en/news/press-releases/details/news/detail/News/porsche-heads-for-domination-agreement-1), stated that instead of 35%, it now owned 42.6% of Volkswagen ordinary shares. It also announced that it owned call options (in the form of structured products) on an additional 31.5% of the company. It was now officially announcing its intention to take out Volkswagen, after saying for over a year it had no intention to.  Ferdinand Piëch who was still CEO (and also a 10% owner of Porsche; board member of both companies... great corporate governance, right?) showed that he had engineered a way to not only cement himself permanently as CEO of Volkswagen, but by combining the two companies, become an even bigger presence in the auto world than his grandpappy.  If you're following along and doing the math.... Porsche with 42.6% of voting equity + 31.5% via calls = 74.1% of the company. Also the state of Lower Saxony owned 20.2% and index funds owned an approx 5%. That's 99% of all the ords. The holders of the 12% short interest were... royally fucked.  Some of the world-famous hedgies that got bent over during those two days include: Steve Cohen, David Einhorn, Paul Singler.  **The Aftermath**  The funny thing is that Porsche had really, truly gone full autist on the trade. Porsche had borrowed more than €15bn to finance the stock and derivative purchases over 3 years and €10bn of that was due soon (in the middle of the financial crisis... guess if they were able to refinance). To make matters worse... in true autist form, they didn't have the money on hand to take delivery of the shares they had the right to buy via their options.  Ultimately, in what is a fucked up ending to a fucked up story.... Volkswagen bailed out Porsche by buying Porsche AG (the manufacturing arm) from Porsche SE (the holding company) so that Porsche SE (the holding company) could finish buying Volkswagen. Essentially... Porsche SE now owned Volkswagen who owned Porsche AG. Hmm.  Porsche's CEO gets fired for this royal fuck-up and goes to work as a pizza boy at a pizzeria.

Couple reasons:  1. Fords cut their dividend two weeks ago and they have closed plants, so all downside is already priced in. 2. Both long term calls and the actual stock is dirt cheap trading at 6x earnings. 3. Ford will not go broke, they pulled out as much cash as they could from their credit lines to weather the storm. 4. The FED is buying corporate junk bonds so all Ford has to do is sell more bonds and they get free money. 5. They make badass trucks, way cooler than anything Chevy or Dodge put out, lets be real Ford trucks are the standards. 6. A lot of people are short selling the stock so we will likely see a short squeeze in the next couple days. 7. They are retooling their plants to make medical supplies like Ventilators, etc.  Very little downside, unlimited upside.  OH AND THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO BUY FORD THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION!!!  A few days ago there was a huge DD on the WSB homepage about why you should sell Ford.

China is back to work, and even if they need to undergo further quarantines, they've proven their effectiveness. If you recall back to 2015, one of the massive drivers a fear was a slowdown in China. A Chinese slowdown is arguably worse than a US slowdown as China: a) makes everyone's shit, and b) is one of the fastest growing consumers of shit. This leads me to point 2.  2. Outside of a handful of industries, the US economy will be largely unscathed. We're a consumer economy, and we consume best from home. The growing majority of business is handled digitally or in such a way that human interaction is extremely limited. We order goods online, food through our phones, and entertainment literally anywhere now that everything's digital. The 1 year hit that airliners and ""physical"" entertainment will take is negligible in the grand scheme.  3. The people becoming unemployed (get ready for a real redpill) are not the important contributors to the economy. These people almost entirely live paycheck to paycheck and weren't spending much outside of necessary spending. The white collar workers will keep working -- albeit from home -- and continue being, frankly, the main-by-a-large-margin contributors to economic growth. Especially now that they'll be buying even more shit to distract themselves during this boring pandemic.   4. The Fed and US gov't, unlike in 2001 or 2008, have immediately and firmly expressed their intent to provide safety nets for nearly all distressed companies and even individuals.   5. Debt covenant compliance is almost universally being waived for the remainder of this pandemic, severely mitigating the risk of a corporate bond market meltdown.  6. Non-IG bonds will probably suffer, but: a) the majority of the main market indexes are high credit, and b) non-IG markets regularly experience bearish periods even during market-wide bull runs. Ford going under will do nothing to the rest of the market (frankly, it's been expected for over a decade).

This is for 3/26-3/27. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.  &amp;#x200B;  DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.  &amp;#x200B;  As is tradition, I shall start with the news. [Boris Johnson](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpv7i4/boris_johnson_tests_positive_for_covid19/) (The UK's Trump) has tested positive for WuFlu. That=we are fuk. There is news [that GM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqf7b/gm_building_mass_ventilators_fake_news_people/) and Ford will not be building ventilators for the hospitals as DJ Trump said. They did not realize the logistics and that transmissions and ventilators are not the same thing. For those of us that cant extrapolates, this means fewer ventilators for victims of China's Plague of Doom.  &amp;#x200B;  The Federal Government and JPow are spending a shit load on trying to keep the SS Economy from taking a nose dive to the Marianas Trench. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/) explains the numbers and there are even pictures for you to look at. The Fed is throwing lots and lots of money at this problem to make the ship sink a little slower. Well, they can't do that forever and today is clearly an example of that. Money only makes people happy for so long, especially when their family is dying.  &amp;#x200B;  Now I know we hate every other investing subreddit, however, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fp4vxy/my_experience_of_the_2008_bailout/) is a good (serious) view of what the coming months will look like and relates what is coming to 2008. We are ticking all the boxes of similarities and that is not a good thing. Not saying its gonna be as bad as The Great Recession but lookout.    &amp;#x200B;  Next is another bit of knowledge for you fucks. My boy u/fuzzyblankeet did one of the [best breakdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) I have ever seen using SeaWorld (SEAS) as an example. He explains how to break down any companies 10-K (which is an annual report about the financials, company makeup, etc.). He shows us retards how to do a targeted review, breakdown and understand their debt, and goes over financial covenants. These are all big words but if you read the post then it'll be a lot easier to understand. Reading this post will allow you to do YOUR OWN DD instead of relying on WSB and fucking idiots like me.  &amp;#x200B;  On to the actual plays. Mariott (MAR) looks like it's gonna have some problems because of the Beer Flu. No one is traveling right now so no one is booking hotel rooms. No bookings= no revenue. Expect a drop in earnings, and because of this, a drop in stock price. MAR 5/15 50p is what [the OP said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpiimx/big_dd_marriott_is_dead/) but I would go for a higher strike because people will want to sell at the price of the stock now ($80) if it drops to $50 a share.    &amp;#x200B;  Likewise, oil is going to be something to watch in the coming weeks. If America and our economy goes tits up, oil goes tits up according to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ff7/the_fall_of_oil_and_how_you_can_make_tendies/).  The US economy grinding to a standstill will compound with the Saudis dropping the price per barrel and ramping up production. His post gives us a few ways to profit from the fall of oil including ETFs, options, and stocks. Puts on any oil company that can not support itself through this and make sure they expire late April/May. Note, DO NOT play with DWT or UWT. They are being delisted on April 3rd.   &amp;#x200B;  (Warning; satire!) Now I'm gonna do a little fear-mongering. So the book of Revelations tells humans how the world will end. The 4 horsemen of the apocalypse will come (Famine, Death, War, Pestilence), trumpets will sound, and the end will be nigh. We already have death and pestilence (which means plague) because of COVID19. Famine is coming with the [GIANT SWARM OF LOCUSTS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-a-plague-of-locusts-is-threatening-crops-in-africa-and-beyond/ar-BB11JOHX?li=BBnb7Kz) 3 times the size of New York in Africa and the middle east. And with China and the US having a [dick measuring contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsulz/trade_war_part_2/) in the Taiwan Strait we are looking at the possibility of war. Also, are we sure that God said trumpets and not Trump/Pence? Just kidding, this is all bullshit, I don't believe in God. If he's real then he's a dick.  Strike me down where I stand.  &amp;#x200B;  Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is [this man](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpm6qt/ive_been_told_to_come_here_to_make_it_all_back/). Why would you come to WSB to make your money back? What a fucking idiot. I thought that everyone knew we only lost money here. You lose $260,000 and come to the hive mind of autism for help? Fuck off.  &amp;#x200B;  Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR; Boris Johnson is fuk, GM and Ford are not medical manufacturers, Feds can only fuck the market for so long, Mariott is fucked possibly, Oil is fucked possibly, and the Book of Revelations is happening.

The rises in these companies are an obvious bubble. Just take a look at the three-month charts for any of these tickers. Where does their profit come from? What do they do uniquely that gives them an edge over other similar companies? Once the crisis is over (say, 3-6 months from now), these companies will be no better than they were before the crisis. Slack and Zoom especially don't have any alternative product.   For instance, morningstar gives Zoom a fair value of $62, Slack $20, Netflix $150. These estimates aren't everything, but fundamentally none of these companies have done anything to increase their true value during the crisis.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/nrcgplk6z8p41.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5badc809933f01cd7390fdc52d124367d0ff951  Similarly, I've seen a lot of risky plays on companies that will obviously have value after coronavirus is over. Uber, Lyft, Ford all have deep enough pockets to wait out coronavirus, and once things are back to normal, they'll be just as valuable. This is why they skyrocketed a few days ago, and why Puts on them won't be as profitable. This being said, I think there's still room to drop and am personally betting on a ""bottom"" in mid-May, based on my virus model. If a recession follows, there will be a long bleed afterwards, but I admit there's potential for a quick recovery, and would maybe even bet more heavily on this side, unless you believe strongly in the underlying problems with repos/loans or whatever.

The Senate late Wednesday unanimously approved a historic $2 trillion coronavirus economic relief package, but 1 million to 4 million Americans are expected to have filed for unemployment benefits last week.

Tuesday’s 11% advance for the Dow was the best session since 1933. The two-day advance was the Dow’s first back-to-back gains this month. However, heading into Thursday, the &gt; * Dow was still more than 28% below its February record high.  *****  &gt; * Cramer: Wall Street ‘has faith’ in stimulus plan, but ‘total lockdown’ still needed (CNBC)”  *****  &gt; * Ariel’s John Rogers: This is a ‘once in a lifetime’ buying opportunity like ’87 and ’08 (CNBC)  *****  &gt; * Hedge fund titans Simons, Griffin, Cohen and Tepper earned $1 billion in 2019 before virus outbreak (CNBC)  *****  &gt; * The Democratic-controlled House is scheduled to take up the Senate coronavirus relief bill Friday morning.

The package includes direct payments to individuals, grants and loans to businesses and more health-care funding. (CNBC)  *****  &gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases increased to over 69,100 with deaths surpassing 1,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. New York’s 33,000 cases are the most of any state by far. New York has seen 366 deaths, nearly triple Washington state’s 133 fatalities.  *****  &gt; * White House health advisor Fauci says US needs to be prepared for second cycle (CNBC)  *****  &gt; * Mark Cuban warns against rushing back to work, says crisis could define brands ‘for decades’ (CNBC)  *****  &gt; * President Donald Trump faces a critical test to assert America’s leadership in the global coronavirus fight at Thursday’s emergency G-20 meeting being held remotely. The U.S. and China have been trading insults, with Trump calling the outbreak the “Chinese virus” and China suggesting the U.S. military brought the virus there. (CNBC)  *****  &gt; * Italy, which has had the most fatalities of any country, has seen its death toll top 7,500, more than double China’s 3,291 fatalities.

(CNBC)  *****  &gt; * Spain, with over 49,500 case, saw its death toll of 3,647 exceed that of China as well.

(CNBC)  *****  &gt; * Apple (AAPL) is considering delaying the launch of its next iPhone by months, according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review. That comes amid supply chain disruptions and falling customer demand due to the virus outbreak. Apple has released a new iPhone in September or October in each year since 2011.  *****  &gt; * McDonald’s (MCD) is pulling its all-day breakfast menu to simplify operations as the coronavirus strains restaurant operations. “We will regularly evaluate the situation and look to move back to our regular menu as soon as possible,” according to a statement.

(CNBC)  *****  &gt; * Rich Williams has stepped down as Groupon (GRPN) CEO and Steve Kenzer has stepped down as COO. Both moves are effective immediately, although the daily deals provider said both remain at Groupon. The company did not comment on the reason for the changes.

In total, the tally has ballooned to $934 billion of U.S. corporate bonds that yield at least 10 percentage points above Treasuries and loans that trade for less than 80 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s nearly double the amount from less than a week ago.  The total is probably even higher, because the calculation excludes debt of small-to-medium sized companies whose loans trade rarely, if at all.  &amp;#x200B;  .......  &amp;#x200B;  Energy isn’t alone. Every sector except utilities is under stress, with distressed ratios growing by double or triple digits. Telecommunications, retail, entertainment and healthcare industries make up the bulk of distressed debt. Retailers such as Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and theater chains such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. have been hit hard as companies are forced to close and customers are told to stay home.  Distress in the automotive industry also jumped as consumers decide to cancel travel and stay put. Even investment-grade giants are at risk. Ford Motor Co. now makes up one of the largest issuers with debt tumbling to distressed levels, with a dozen issues hovering near or below 75 cents on the dollar.  &amp;#x200B;  Source:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/distressed-debt-balloons-almost-1-171644746.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/distressed-debt-balloons-almost-1-171644746.html)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1048260|public|confidence|self|Distressed Debt Balloons to Almost $1 Trillion, Nears 2008 Peak|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foxsqh/distressed_debt_balloons_to_almost_1_trillion/|no_ads|0.0||dark|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'ETyfEdUOyJq2wsfGb7PBF_TDwSxG9P-0db9c8576g6E', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a2197985cde2df347898a1db8b73beb1db2d199', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6eb2d44fead6cc62b6ee28fbe9c914be18d2d0f5', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a54123b14347ee73bb19e8204e85ce4346f875a', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9229c18c75759ee1be44b6493152e3c9d41dee6', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=628b7b5bc26d27a844fe61051871a7c5882bf5b2', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43cd628ed5d0ac46c943dbd413952a3bd82f0e95', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 675, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/hjOQ0Tw7EVcx-NXNMZvY-xDqcqfNIB2V02AD5TlQKNM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=36eb9598a99a892d4100201c1dfcdaedb6da0fae', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-03-25|FORD

Period. Sure people picked up cash on puts during this crash, but that was universal. Will there be volatility? 100%.   Tesla has a TON of cash. Between their credit lines (which was extended in FEB with borderline clairvoyance) and cash reserves we are talking about 8.5B.   Tesla’s competition has been crushed. Ford / GM/ Fiat, they all have higher operations expenses (I.E. dealerships / union workers pensions, high employee counts, etc.).   Believe it or not, Tesla has the best ability to fair in this storm. When the storm settles their competition will be hurting far worse.   They are using this time to EXPAND. Other manufactures are overproducing vehicles, Tesla needs to increase output to meet demand. That’s a good spot.   Tesla also has a great footprint and relationship with the very hard market of China (which will buy MAD vehicles and they won’t be Ford). I mean PR or not Elon essentially mocked the CV by purchasing ventilators from the source of the virus as overstock and delivered them to the US. Those 1.25k ventilators are now 25% of the ventilators delivered to NYC.   Not to mention, future ventures in solar, insurance (leveraging driver data), vehicle autonomy software, ride share. Space??  Buy Tesla. It ignores the rules of the market and has the potential to still hit 1k a share before EOY and could be worth 4K a share before 2024.   Tesla is a true WSB even simply buying shares. If you think you can time it with calls, god bless.

Car sales in the gutter for the first 3 quarters of 2020. 2. Ford Capital is going to face a large number of defaults. 3. Manufaturing plants shut down. 4. Possible workforce downsizings and future news is   unpredictable.  The company has refused Fed bailouts and has never taken a bailout in the past as far as I looked. ( I may be wrong and if I am, please pm me I will edit.). They have approx 10B - 8B $ left from last year in free cash provided no unexpected expenses they should be able to maintain the stability of the company in the short term for up to a year. The business is going to take a hit, especially Ford capital. And also to boos buying in the 4th quarter, they will have to put out incentives for consumers which will again draw on their reserves in that quarter.  Now I am going to analyze the stock from a data-driven point of view. The key factor will be stock behavior during times of major economic crisis in the last 40 years, with more emphasis on unexpected and extreme events as follows:  1987 market crash \[Black Monday\]: 26 October 1987 - 17.72$ / share \[Pre-crash\]  11 November 1987 - 11.14$/ share \[steady decline over   3 months\]  10 October 1988 - 16.9$/ share \[ Recovery took 1 year\]  1989 market crash \[Black Friday\]: 13 February 1989 - 17.14$/ share \[Pre-crash\]  07 October 1990 - 8.79$/ share \[Steady decline over   1 year 10 months\]  22 June 1992 - 14.56$/ share \[ Recovery took 1   year 7 months\]  1994 market crash \[Bond Crisis\]: 31 January 1994 - 21.32$/ share \[Pre-crash\]  14 March 1995 - 16.67$/ share \[Steady decline over 1   year 2 months\]  21 May 1996 - 23.31$/ share \[Recovery took over 1   year 2 months\]  1999 market crash\* \[ Dot com\]: 01 April 1999 - 35.90$/ share \[Pre-crash\]  28 March 2003 - 7.41$/ share \[Erratic decline over   2 years 11 months\]  02 February 2004 - 16$/ share \[Recovery took 10   months\]  2007 market crash\[Mortgage Crisis\] 12 October 2007 - 9.2$/ share \[Pre-crash\]  05 March 2009 - 1.81$/ share \[Steady decline over   1 year 5 months\]  24 January 2011 - 17.93$/ share \[Recovery took 1   year 8 months\]  2020 market crash\[ Corona crash\] 29 January 2020 - 8.86$/ share \[ Pre-crash\]  23 March 2020 - 4.24$/ share \[ as of today\]  The only exception is the 1999 dotcom bubble, the tech stocks crash was immediately followed by the SARS panic in 2001 which in effect extended the bear market by an additional year. Also, that also makes that specific crash all the more relevant for my market analysis as the number of parallels we can draw to the bubble burst and the COVID-19 induced financial weakness of our current time is insane.  Based on the above data I am expecting the stock to have a resistance band at 1.00$. I arrived at this number based on the company behavior in the 2007-2009 period and the fact that they still have the option to borrow at dirt cheap rates thanks to the fed rate cuts last week. The low also will depend on the length of the current quarantines and workforce shutdowns. And going by past data, the lows will be arriving at least 3 months from now due to the speed of the crash which is reminiscent of the Black Monday crash, and any form of recovery from this crisis will be a minimum of 1 year and 2 months from the lows.  TL/DR: Good solid company that has little choice of going bust. Short term puts and long term calls to print tendies.  The first post on WSB lets gooo!!!!

I remember saving up 3k before i went to study abroad and it was SO MUCH MONEY!   I blew all that shit in Japan when It was so expensive to live. I taught English for meals between classes.     At one point I was cleaning toilets at night, studying while working at a computer lab during the day, and delivering pizza on weekends between class.     I remember smoking resin because I couldn't afford weed. God knife hits are the worst.   I remember my first internship at a large firm, my intern roommate asked me if i could just give them ""all the rent for the summer, so we didn't have to deal with collecting money"" and he ""had his paychecks sent to his apartment he kept over the summer during college."". I remember being fucking floored at the audacity of the situation. I drove down there in my 23 year old ford taurus with everything that I owned in my car. I laughed and told him I couldn't pay until I got paid. This was just 6 years ago.     My first year with the firm I remember wondering how I'd get to the client site because I wasn't sure I'd have enough for gas going back and forth for the first two weeks until we got paid.  &amp;#x200B;  I remember one of my roommate's dad's, a partner with the firm in another city thinking we lived in the ghetto during my internship. He was horrified.  &amp;#x200B;  I remember my intern roommate thanking me for being the ""ambassador"" to the neighborhood because I hung out with my neighbors and BBQed and partied with them. They were BLACK OMFG YOU GUYS! WE LIVED IN THE HOOD RIGHT! It was pretty fucked up to hear that. The north side Chicago kid was always very.  &amp;#x200B;  This isn't about race, creed, or status. This isn't an ""up and coming"" story. I've always thought of my life as very normal. I never really felt I had struggles more than the next. In retrospect I did more than some and less than others. Whatever.      But yesterday I was sitting there, and I vaporized $150 and it didn't bother me at all. Ooops, caught the scalp on the wrong way and got about before more damage.  &amp;#x200B;  It occurred to me that I paid my dog walker $150 a month to take my dog on hikes because I'm a fucking yuppy now with a busy job and we aren't usually at home all day. I broke even in that sense. But my dog walker? They're me not long ago.      I honestly don't know what I would've done if this was happening 4-5 years ago. I'd assume I'd be getting support from parents, something I never really tried to ask for before, but I had a network of support, sure. But not everyone does. And I haven't really been in a situation where I've had to ask.  I've lost money in my 401k. But I earned some back on PUTs watching the world burn. I have friends who are hoping to not get laid off.   I'm lucky my company sells shit to grocery stores and my wife's tech company isn't going to fold. We have a nice income and live in a fine house and are able to continue our world remotely while others are completely devastated by the disruption to the local economy.  So last night we ordered pizza and tipped 50%.  Today we e-mailed our dog walker to tell her we'll keep paying her despite not walking our dog.    The cleaning ladies will get paid too.  sure I could save myself another $500 a month by not doing this. But I already am without going out to restaurants and using services. This isn't REALLY costing me anything. If I stop spending when my income isn't affected, I'm just hoarding cash and making money as the world burns.  &amp;#x200B;  Be a bear, make money. Try not to root too hard to it, and if you do, do your part. Get the fuck out there and spend money on those that keep your neighborhood great. Order food from your favorite restaurant down the way, and pay the person walking your pets. Donate to a charity if you want.  &amp;#x200B;  Whatever the fuck you do, don't sit here and make money and not give back. If you're hoarding tendies right now, you're a fucking asshole and deserve a ban.   &amp;#x200B;  I know this sub is generally good about donations, but you don't have to just meme donate to an autism organization because its funny. There's serious issues with certain sectors of the economy, and we need to take care of those people.   &amp;#x200B;  If $150 loss doesn't phase you for a second, think about spending that on your local people right now. It definitely is phasing them.  Plus you get to eat fucking pizza and feel good about yourself and shit. Come the fuck on and get spending."|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1036075|public|confidence|self|Ya'll need to Donate some tendies to your local economy|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmktql/yall_need_to_donate_some_tendies_to_your_local/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-03-21|FORD

Though the stock market can be unpredictable, and I'm down $150 this week on Ford, Six Flags, and AMC, here's what I've learned:  1) Don't buy calls mid-pandemic that you're not selling that day. Most people who have made tons of money on calls in the past few weeks have bought them prior to one of Trump's speeches and sold them the same day.  2) Don't buy calls when skilled fiction writers concoct a story about EOD green. When there are hundreds of people dying in Italy every day, worldwide border restrictions, corporation on pause, why the hell would you buy calls EOD?  3) Don't panic sell your puts.  4) Don't buy anything with no volume or a massive bid-ask difference.  5) Before you buy something, just go to the news tab of Google and read the headlines for 15 seconds.  Also, the people who are actually good at this took their logo to the private sub.

These options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and   strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking    down their order to get filled faster.  Here - [https://imgur.com/a/crpJNFE](https://imgur.com/a/crpJNFE)  Also   all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest  in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either  buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the     aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of  these may be  hedges and some most likely not.  I like the HD put 110 orders for 01-2021. Seems aggressive and against this move today. Uber too should be watched. 11 puts are way way OTM by next friday, it doubt it will happen. But if it does wow.  Don't   just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.   Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined   instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry   about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of   putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND  IV CRUSH!!  Also  with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.  EDIT   - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when  I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and unusual like SBUX   order flow.  EDIT  - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.  Technicals say there is more room to fall in the indexes so most  companies should follow.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1030312|public|confidence|self|Aggressive/Unusual Options Sweeps - UBER/F/HD/LK|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flfxt4/aggressiveunusual_options_sweeps_uberfhdlk/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '29kO4BfzJIsUbmN-Hz5IOphO7adePNFvTzUe1jgx5Ac', 'resolutions': [{'height': 34, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03ae420e3eb931b463d8325988eb2e7e52261fdf', 'width': 108}, {'height': 68, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dfb4af41826dd561a2cf37db5c6f66b040b4ecf', 'width': 216}, {'height': 101, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afce6ed0d92eb62cc6145139ee823030866bb590', 'width': 320}, {'height': 203, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1efc759a1351b7e209888b77ff939caf2f7a68', 'width': 640}, {'height': 304, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfcac8bead522841a126d2a497ec7f77dab78023', 'width': 960}, {'height': 342, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14e516953376dd9c56a9bb045f1361c427fb33e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 612, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Hf1q9-NvWzlbeF7NiqN71sEqerqgTGgA1vhzA8J7X5c.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=cac4d5476f93a390953131ab064068eb512b5b85', 'width': 1929}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-03-19|FORD

Even pre-corona virus, auto-stocks have been seeing a gradual decline.  China is the world's largest automobile market, but saw [sliding sales](https://www.marklines.com/en/statistics/flash_sales/salesfig_china_2019) in 2019.  Enter corona-virus.  Amid factory and dealership shutdowns, China saw a [79% decrease](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-crushes-china-car-sales-11583996034) in auto sales in February 2020 compared to last year.  80% of global car production requires parts from China, and we are beginning to see the effects of supply chain disruption.  Combine this with the fact that corona-virus is currently ravaging Europe, and is about to seriously ramp up in the U.S. and you have a disaster for auto-companies as we head towards recession.  Ford doesn't have much going for it relative to competitors, other than it's gas guzzling trucks and SUV's.

A family friend is C-Suite at one of the top 3 American Auto OEMs supplying Ford, GM, etc.      He's banging my Mom and let slip that there was a big meeting today where the industry heads arrived at the decision to freeze OEM production for at least 6 weeks, announcement TBD but very soon. So how do I turn these ghost transmissions into tendies? (He usually let's my Dad pay rent on the room above the garage a bit late, but demanded it on time this week so I know he is worried.)     Here is my attempt at DD, let me know if I should change to DD flair:  &amp;#x200B;  \- Domestic OEMs that sell to car companies: lay-offs, slashed expectations, bad press due to lay-offs and slashed expectations, panic when customers realize they might have to buy a steering wheel off of a Benihana menu, etc. So, short the OEMs? But we already know auto industry is fucked, so this type of news is probably priced in but might cause a dramatic dip in the near-term, yeah?      \- Car companies: pretty much same as above, except the 1 month chart for all these companies kinda look like when you throw a baseball and no one catches it so it just hits the ground. Is it possible for these stocks to go negative? Should I wait until the share price is negative so they have to pay me to assume the risk of the stock?  &amp;#x200B;  \- NWL: Newell Brands, the owner of Elmer's Glue. When Henry Ford said faster horses or w/e we weren't in a recession. Well guess what we are in a recession. We will probably have more horses on the streets because we have less cars (there is a historical precedent that these goods are direct replacements if you compare DoD data). More horses on the streets = more dead horses = more glue supply. Shitty foreign car parts = need glue to keep the cars stuck together = more revenue.

Supposedly they will have a really bad earnings report on 4/28 and some other problems before then with possibly slashing dividends. Some people say they may go bankrupt. Open to other ideas though.

Sales in China for Ford and GM are already being lost to domestic Chinese companies. Check this article from Jan:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html)      **Reason #2: Coronavirus in China and the US**   Coronavirus has TANKED auto sales in China (over 80%). People aren't going out, people aren't buying cars. Unless you're getting a car from a Carvana machine, you're probably at a dealership shaking hands, which no one wants to do right now. China sales drop, which we can expect to see mirrored in the US as the virus spreads.     [https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/)      Manufacturing facilities are also slowed in China, and likely to be slowed in the US. This is not a job that can be done working from home, and the manufacturing process will suffer if people cannot go out to work in factories.     **Reason #3: Looming Recession**   With the possibility off a recession on the horizon, this is especially important to consider. Auto Manufacturing gets absolutely pummeled in recessions. Cars are simply not a luxury people can afford in troubling financial times. Also, GM has recently invested a TON of money trying to prove that it can compete in the EV market. If a downturn happens now, this could obliterate its chances of competing anytime in the near future.     Take a look at the charts here from McKinsey on how auto manufacturing is susceptible and was hit in 2008:  [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics)      Positions:  [https://imgur.com/a/VRGj38e](https://imgur.com/a/VRGj38e) but I'm definitely buying more puts     TL:DR - Puts on GM and probably Ford too|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|973312|public|confidence|self|Why GM is Fucked|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fghbf1/why_gm_is_fucked/|no_ads|0.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'yE4FwbY0HNwrs61N41mSsEsMZoQW8r0RhbFBe5kk0ao', 'resolutions': [{'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237a49f6b1d6636aaf603101298a2295327e5d75', 'width': 108}, {'height': 432, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c130ff7a24d8d83f4095ef3f32347ddc82475918', 'width': 216}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e17ecfceca41807b8818e728d7c2d24c15beef98', 'width': 320}, {'height': 1280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c7a238f0299588c55f07b3cbda02c50ef19e17d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1920, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658ae6cbccd711a2f61fc443a70fd12d474c5b0d', 'width': 960}, {'height': 2160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3632079cba3a843a344ee35ea94db304e1aea61', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2220, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KzAWOpeSqiQlj8ElWq3l42mTNweXn4hiMg_ehtOL0rE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ce16675469bbe2227dcc6a165c2d601bbfcab5e1', 'width': 1080}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-03-10|FORD

The influx of media attention over the past week on SPCE and LL has made it clear that some users are attempting to use this forum to pump their positions (against Rule 8 of the sub). In addition, the sub has seen a rise in users resulting from media attention and r/all over the past few months. Recently, some pumpers have been able to leverage the size of this community to pump stocks.   **The reason** u/closethefuckinglight **was banned:**   First, though not a reason for the ban but an important fact, the user's post on $LL was his first on reddit although he had an account greater than 3 years of age. He used the platform for personal gain by moving markets.   Here is how u/closethefuckinglight was able to move markets:  * The user took a position on a highly shorted, small cap company ($LL has a short interest of 38%, $MIK at 49%) * The user posted DD on this sub on the name. Due to the low attention span of users, a post of greater than a paragraph was taken as genius thinking. Users and others that visit the forum then bought calls in large amounts (Call volume on $LL was 73x the 20d average; see: [https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd](https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd) taken at 1pm EST)    * Posting DD is a good thing. However, it was obvious this user had the intention of pumping. Inn the future, DD should be on stocks that are not penny stocks or small caps.        * To those that say this is no different than Citron posting a research piece, tough shit. * The large amount of call buying forces market makers to delta hedge their short delta positions by buying stock. When call buying is as widespread as it was yesterday, this causes moves (especially in the low float, penny stock names favored by the poster)  * Naturally, this causes the underlying to rise and users (including the poster) profit.   **Let's revisit a few rules now (specifically number 8):**  * No penny stocks (stocks under &lt;$10 or market caps below $1bn); users who violate this, will be banned    * ""Ford is under $10 and it's not a penny stock""        * ""Go take your shitty dividend and head to r/investing"" * No pumping. Period.   **Other actionable items:**  * Any posts or comments on $MIK will be banned.  * Users seen commenting on posts of u/closethefuckinglight relating to markets in his personal subreddit will be permanently banned.   r/wallstreetbets was created to allow users to discuss higher risk plays. Recent pumping is not in the spirit of this sub, is against the rules, and may be market manipulation."|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|892067|public|confidence|self|Regarding the ban of u/closethefuckinglight and ban on $MIK|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7c9rx/regarding_the_ban_of_uclosethefuckinglight_and/|no_ads|0.0||dark||||||||||||||2020-02-21|FORD

""Do you think I'll get a cut of some of those Chicken Nuggies soon, master?"", he enquired.  Disgusted, I began to yearn for a simpler time - a time where I'd have dreams of growing to the age of 65, retiring after a highly successful 0.5% YoY ROI on my $150 investments.  ""Beans and lentils"", I thought, reminiscing on my daily diet for the past 50 years - the very same diet Mr. Powell was now gorging on, trying desperately to raise interest rates, but never quite catching the gasp of air he needed to enact the change. Here I was, rich and powerf-  *BANG* *BANG* *BANG*  I swallowed my adam's apple and inversed my sphincter. Slowly, I crept up to the door, placing my cheesy, wax covered ears against the solid, $65,000 custom Givenchy lacquered wood frame I had purchased not even 1 week ago.  ""Oh he's in there. Yeah, don't worry, we'll squeeze him dry, he won't have anything left when we're done with him.""  Oh no, Could it be...  ""FTC, OPEN UP!""  Oh fuck. They were here to steal my tendies!   *POW*  The door flies off the hinges, striking my jaw and sending me into a nosedive straight into the Ford stock I had laying on the ground.  I let out a muffled, pathetic ""B-but I only bought Microsoft calls~"", before I felt a gut-wrenching blow to my ballsack.  ""Should've thought twice about that while you were pumping stocks online"".   Jerome Powell himself, decked out in a pair of ultra-tall, knee high heels. His foot twisted deeper into my soul. How could I have been so foolish? If I had realized the theta decay coupled with the incredibly high IV is all it would take for me to lose all my gains, I would've never entered this trade.  Reality faded into darkness. Before I knew it I had lost all consciousness, and the only image left in my mind was that of a smiling Satya, and an old, decaying Richard Branson, arms around the others shoulder.   Both smiling, I succumbed to my fate, never to see the tendies that awaited me on my 7/17 calls, which I had a 150% profit on at the time of my death."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|860933|public|confidence|self|So there I was...|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2h93i/so_there_i_was/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-02-11|FORD

The U.S. currency has climbed steadily since the number of coronavirus cases began surging in China last month, pushing the WSJ Dollar Index to its highest level since early October. With many analysts concerned that disruptions to the Chinese economy will dent global growth, investors have been clinging to U.S. assets, helping the S&amp;P 500 rebound from its late-January slide and rise last week to a fresh record.  Although major indexes and the dollar have climbed in tandem, U.S. companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola Co., Ford Motor Co. and 3M Co. have mentioned the negative effects of currency swings on earnings calls, highlighting a possible challenge to the longstanding bull market. A stronger dollar makes it more expensive for companies to bring home foreign sales and makes exporters’ products less competitive abroad.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|851027|public|confidence|self|Dollar’s Surprise Surge Challenges Stock Market Rally Weak global growth and a strong U.S. currency raise potential for disappointing earnings WSJ|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1haee/dollars_surprise_surge_challenges_stock_market/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||2020-02-09|FORD

Welcome to Tuesday. Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-  *****  #[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, February 4th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/what-to-watch-dow-to-soar-delayed-caucus-results-trumps-big-speech.html)  * Despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. stock futures were pointing sharply higher this morning as stocks continue to chip away at last Friday’s losses. Monday’s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC) * The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others. * Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC) * Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC) * Google still isn’t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC) * Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday’s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday’s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC) * Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state’s Democratic Party said a “reporting issue” caused “inconsistencies” in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC) * Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC) * President Donald Trump will be unleashing “relentless optimism” during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: “The Great American Comeback.” (AP) * The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday’s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump’s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC) * Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city’s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases. * No, garlic won’t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC) * Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC) * Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon’s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC) * The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell’s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry’s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry’s data and subscription base. For Harry’s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC) * Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with “advanced lung cancer.” Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment. Last night, Trump tweeted about Limbaugh’s diagnosis, calling the host “a great guy &amp; fantastic political talent,” and wishing him “a speedy recovery.” (CNBC)  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/publish/020420/sec_all_074633996.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jrjebSl.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2OpqS.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/q77vHiR.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VzNhwDy.jpg)**)  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) T.B.A.  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/7usu9rV.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sUcLOoy.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RxUY2Pk.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dTNMp4k.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1EqsZXm.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dce2Kpe.png)**)   *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/ZEQ34Hy.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/is4t4wI.png)**)   *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:  * TSLA * DIS * GOOGL * GOOG * BP * F * CNC * CLX * ETN * SPG  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-clorox-mckesson-sirius-xm-alphabet-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Clorox (CLX)** – The household products maker beat estimates by 15 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.  # **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)** ***** &gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead. ***** &gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck. ***** &gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden. ***** &gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday. ***** &gt; China’s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs. ***** &gt; # Correction or pull back? &gt; Stocks are limping into February after January’s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five. ***** &gt; “February is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it’s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months. ***** &gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. “I call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,” said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%. ***** &gt; “I think it’s a good possibility, just based on valuation—over 19.6 times forward earnings. That’s the most since 2002,” he said. “By my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.” A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high. ***** &gt; “People have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,” said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. “We believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.” Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks. ***** &gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday’s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3. ***** &gt; “I still think it’s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don’t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn’t really change my view,” she said. “I still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,” she said. ***** &gt; Stovall said it’s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders’ policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies. ***** &gt; “Only 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,” he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls. ***** &gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing’s production shut down. ***** &gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter. ***** &gt; Stovall said he’s watching “a combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,” he said. ***** &gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price. ***** &gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become “inverted.” An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China’s economy and the world economy. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**  *****  # What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!  &gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**  &gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**  *****  # Short Circuit  &gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**  &gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**  *****  # 49ers Or Chiefs?  &gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn’t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.  &gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.  &gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we’ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “There have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And wouldn’t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.”  &gt; Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we’re glad the Patriots aren’t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.  *****  # Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm  &gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October—spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index’s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We know from history these calm periods haven’t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn’t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.  &gt; “The coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002–2003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.”  &gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.  &gt; We certainly don’t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003—several months into the 2003–2007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.  &gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.  *****  # February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months  &gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.  &gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**  *****  # Market May be Immune to Coronavirus  &gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.  &gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.  &gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.  &gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.  &gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.  &gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.  &gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$DIS**  &gt; * **$GOOGL**  &gt; * **$SNAP**  &gt; * **$TWTR**  &gt; * **$ABBV**  &gt; * **$F**  &gt; * **$QCOM**  &gt; * **$UBER**  &gt; * **$SYY**  &gt; * **$SPOT**  &gt; * **$ON**  &gt; * **$PINS**  &gt; * **$TWLO**  &gt; * **$BMY**  &gt; * **$CMG**  &gt; * **$IRBT**  &gt; * **$CHKP**  &gt; * **$MRK**  &gt; * **$CNC**  &gt; * **$SNE**  &gt; * **$SIRI**  &gt; * **$GM**  &gt; * **$GILD**  &gt; * **$PTON**  &gt; * **$BP**  &gt; * **$ABG**  &gt; * **$LITE**  &gt; * **$WYNN**  &gt; * **$ATVI**  &gt; * **$CTLT**  &gt; * **$NSSC**  &gt; * **$ACM**  &gt; * **$GOOS**  &gt; * **$SAIA**  &gt; * **$DSPG**  &gt; * **$RACE**  &gt; * **$RCL**  &gt; * **$COP**  &gt; * **$AMG**  &gt; * **$RL** &gt; * **$PLUS**  &gt; * **$NXPI**  &gt; * **$MCK**  &gt; * **$CI**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGOGN8I.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/ITFECsE.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 2.3.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HiGR4EF.png))   &gt; # ***Monday 2.3.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pSEERXv.png))   *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 2.4.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zqLdRqt.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 2.4.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NLPsraN.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Dh1LRRU.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 2.5.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW6dHyJ.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 2.5.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X2cKKMR.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0rp0Yyh.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 2.6.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/02XMggZ.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aqYNFFo.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 2.6.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/s4LwHiF.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/evpxdCi.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 2.7.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DqfZS2l.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 2.7.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tm9eiYq.png))  *****  # Walt Disney Co $138.31 &gt; **Walt Disney Co (DIS)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, February 4, 2020.

I'll tell you why:  Without a doubt, UNH will be a very busy company over the coming 2-6 weeks. This isn't a good thing, though.  As I'm sure you all know, UNH is a health insurance provider. These guys make their money when somebody is insured by them, and doesn't have any reason whatsoever to see a doctor. Their ideal client is someone who pays premium and never gets sick. Their ideal quarter is one in which every hospital in the country is empty. Their ideal country is one in which everyone has to pay for the service UNH provides, but never actually uses it. They make the most when they have to do nothing at all.  UNH is Theta gang, who sells premium against disease.  Whether you think that the Wuhan Flu is an actual issue or not, one thing is certain: people are frightened by it. Although most times people just ""shrug off"" cold like symptoms, with the recent sensationalist headlines, there will be an unexpectedly high amount of clinic/ER visits for silly little runny noses and other bullshit. Although these won't be bonafide Wuhan Flu cases, UNH will still have to pay out for the MD/hospital services rendered. If WuFlu actually DOES end up being something... just look up the daily cost of an ICU visit to get an idea of the claims payouts UNH might be looking at.  Furthermore, it's looking like there is a growing threat to UNH's very market niche. There is rising fear and uncertainty in the market that there will even be a **role** for UNH if Bernie implements universal health care. Whether you think public health care is a good idea or not, and whether you think Bernie might/should be president, it's clear that there is a growing possibility that American health care may join the rest of the developed world with a public health system. If this happens, would UNH even have a product to sell?  If health care goes public, UNH and others will be left with nothing other than their dicks in their hands. Their sole product will become obsolete. Imagine being a horse shoe salesman when Henry Ford popularized the car. Imagine being a slide rule manufacturer at the advent of the calculator. Despite having a $30B market cap, UNH could possibly be left with the same valuation as $LEH.  UNH is theta gang, during the world's largest health care scare in over 15 years. They're Abacus Inc., just as a new calculator shop is opening up down the street.

What will happen to the stock price if they beat on earnings next week?  Or I should say what do people expect will happen?  Can the stock price go up, considering it is not really at realistic levels to begin with? In my mind it doesnt seem like these two things (earnings and stock price) should be correlated next week as they are not now.

The army stretched so far that Napoleon would drop his jaw. Their march quaked the ground. The unstoppable army launches a massive invasion south.   Success. They conquer Canada.

The major averages set record intraday highs early in Friday’s session, with the Dow topping 29,000 for the first time, but then slid the rest of the day to finish lower. Nonetheless, the S&amp;P 500 has posted weekly gains in six of the past seven weeks, while the Nasdaq is up for five straight weeks. (CNBC) * U.S.-China trade war taking a toll, but a minor one: Much of economy unscathed (WSJ) * No major economic reports are due today, but three Fed officials are set to make public appearances during trading hours: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Meanwhile, no earnings reports are on today’s calendar. (CNBC) * Boeing’s (BA) new Chief Executive David Calhoun assumes the job today as the U.S. planemaker battles to recover from two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes that killed 346 people in five months and led to the model’s worldwide grounding in March. Calhoun was named CEO in December after the board stripped Dennis Muilenburg of the title. (Reuters) * Mnuchin: Boeing 737 Max crisis could slow US growth by a half point in 2020 (CNBC) * President Donald Trump authorized the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani seven months ago if Iran’s increased aggression resulted in the death of an American, NBC News reported. The presidential directive in June came with the condition that Trump would have final sign-off on any specific operation to kill Soleimani, officials said. * Defense Secretary Esper ‘didn’t see’ specific evidence of Trump claim that Iran planned embassy attacks (CNBC) * Trump expressed solidarity with Iranian protesters as they took to the streets of Tehran over the weekend, after the Islamic Republic admitted it accidentally shot down a Ukraine-bound airliner, killing all 176 people on board the Boeing aircraft. Trump also warned the Iranian government that the “world is watching. * Iran denies shooting at protesters amid fury over downing of passenger plane (Reuters) * The U.S. has reportedly reached out to North Korea to restart diplomatic talks that stalled last October. Washington wants to get negotiations with Pyongyang “back on track” and implement leader Kim Jong Un’s “commitment” to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, White House national security advisor Robert O’Brien told Axios. (CNBC) * Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was endorsed by veteran Iowa Congressman Dave Loebsack, just three weeks before the party’s nominating contest begins in Iowa on Feb. 3. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained the support of an influential labor union in New Hampshire, which holds the second primary contest. (Reuters) * Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is set to hold talks today with Prince Harry for the first time since he and his wife, Meghan, unveiled their controversial plan to walk away from royal roles, a dramatic family summit meant to chart a future course for the couple. Harry and Meghan announced last week they wanted to “step back” as senior royals. (AP) * Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa is looking for a female “life partner” to accompany him on Space X’s maiden tourist voyage to the Moon. Meanwhile, Maezawa is due to announce which of his Twitter followers will receive a share of the $9 million he promised to give away as part of a social experiment.

I don't think so. To me, there are two ways to look at TSLA. One is as a car company. The other is as a car+tech company. Regardless of the way you look at it, it's not overvalued.   I won't get into all the details because I don't think it's necessary. It's possible to value TSLA with a simple comparison. TSLA is already valued more than car companies like Ford. And rightly so. Toyota is worth about 230b, currently about 3 times what TSLA is valued. Toyota got that market cap because their cars are known as quality and dependable, plus they've penetrated a lot of markets. TSLA is more comparable to Toyota because they're earning a reputation of quality and people want their cars, and those that have them are loyal to them. TSLA is attempting to penetrate other markets, especially China.   Toyota has about 4.5% China market share. TSLA has well below 1% I believe, but given China being largest and fastest growing EV market, it's pretty safe to assume TSLA will get at least 4.5% market share.   I think TSLA is better compared to a top car company like Toyota than others. That puts it at 3 times higher share price than it's at now. TSLA is doing much more than just cars though, and their potential for so much more is pretty high. So a 3 times higher share price is the low estimate for their share price, $1290 per share. It'll take years but I believe it's more than within reach.  So $1290 is my low end estimate. My high end estimate is more difficult to estimate. TSLA could extend past cars into tech like software, or even gadgets, who knows. If that happens, sky is the limit and it could even gain an additional 100b+ in market cap. So my top end estimate is $1920. These estimates are years in the future though, not your typical 1 year estimate that analyst firms put out. My one year estimate is at least $520, it'll have multiple earning report beats that push it up.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|767332|public|confidence|self|TSLA...

TSLA doesn’t appear to be at any risk of bankruptcy anymore, and it has high long term potential. Relative value is fuzzy. At today’s $72B market cap, it’s worth more than Ford or GM, but so is the $51B dumpster fire Uber, and NFLX’s $146B is 2x TSLA. Toyota (TM) is at $202B.   Right now I’m wondering if TSLA will act like a luxury good where a strong SPX can carry it to the moon but a weak SPX will drop it into the gutter. But the hive mind here has a lot more knowledge than my little brain.   What does your ouija board say?

If you open up the MACD and a 1-month chart you can see the pattern and trend. The volume sold is also much higher than expected. Ive noticed these trends happen over a week frame so lets say you time the MACD and oscillator and buy Ford stock at $8.50. you wait 6 days and see that the MACD is showing bearish signs so you sell against for $9. You've just made $.50 a share.   If you were to invest $100 into this you would have a quick 5% gain in a week. I tested my theory out yesterday Bought at $8.83 and sold at $9.05 today.

BUT, in my reading of what he showed, went largely underappreciated by the mainstream.   &amp;#x200B;  No one is buying these for hauling for construction, paint business or other trade work. This is a personal ""fun"" truck. His swipe at Ford is cute, but people who buy F150 for actual hauling is not his target audience.  So what does it have going for it?  &amp;#x200B;  1. Its unusual visual design will not stop people from buying the truck. In fact, it adds a ""cool"" factor for the younger well-to-do crowd and those who see themselves as paramilitary or with military connections. You will see these outfitted as modern stealth fighter jets. Matte black spray or wrap (if only we could get hands on [Vantablack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCI2KYhC8vk) finish!) will be one of the top choices . If anything this truck reminds me of two vehicles and both of them are cool - DeLorean and the APC from the Aliens (used to ram the Alien). 2. Performance for a truck is unreal. Sub 3 second 0-60mph will be a an attractive enough spec for many car enthusiasts just so that they can shame sports cars at traffic lights. Even the cheapest version will outrun many gasoline powered sporty looking cars. 3. Bulletproof panels, though not intentionally and minimally ? Even though it's not designed for this purpose, at $40K NEW car with warranty that can stop a 9 mil as long as it doesn't go through the class is going to be popular overseas. Places like Russia, China, Mexico, etc can absorb all Cybertruck manufacturing capacity. If they actually improve the glass - these will become extremely popular overseas.  Again - this is not a competition to an actually armored car, but at this price it is a very nice feature that may sway a certain group of buyers.  4. They have a built-in compressor, air suspension, ramp in the gate, and 120v outlets making them excellent for a weekend camping trip vehicle. People with money who have active lifestyle and are into surfing, biking, snowboarding, skiing, etc will like this truck. 5. Every rich kid and their dad will want one of these in their collection because of all the unusual features it offers over regular cars.  I really think this addition to the lineup and model Y will take Tesla to even higher territory. Elon is not thinking next step when playing this game, he is looking several steps ahead of competition. He doesn't want to go head-to-head on the terms of other car manufacturers, he will be pushing the boundaries and this is why this Meme stock is going to be going higher and higher.

Back in the day, people used to discuss the gambling-ish stock trades they were making. At the beginning it was all about users throwing their life savings into penny stocks, losing it all, and then posting about their losses for that sweet sweet karma. There was a Bitcoin frenzy for a little while, and then the sub discovered options, where the *real* gambling could happen. (If you know nothing about options: when used the way most /r/wsb users use them, they're essentially all-or-nothing bets on the direction a stock will go. You usually lose everything you bet, but sometimes you make 10x your money. It's essentially playing roulette, except the house you're playing against is not just a dinky casino but the entire god damn financial system. Suffice it to say it's a tough bet to win big on. Of course I'm simplifying, but honestly that's as good of an understanding as 95% of the users here have about options anyway.)   Users like /u/fscomeau started getting infamous for gambling huge amounts on ridiculously bad takes (like that Apple stock was going to crash), and they usually lost it all and posted about it for the memes. Every now and again (it was rare, but it happened), someone would make tens of thousands of dollars on a single trade, get upvoted heavily, and spur dozens of other idiots to gamble their money trying to do the same thing. Those people would bet thousands on dumb stocks, lose it all, and post about it. Rinse, repeat. It'd be impossible for me to list all the people who lost tons of money based on the bad advice they got in that sub, but there's a [Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsaet3/hall_of_autists/) (or Shame, probably) growing that you can peruse to get some more color.   Now, as tremendously dumb as that is, it's pretty understandable. Maybe expected, even. People with no regard for their own money gamble it away every day. It's dumb, but it's a relatively harmless and contained dumb, you know?   Then, in 2015, the sub blew up and made like a thousand people mods, and the entire culture began its long shift to pure memery. There was still a facade of it being all about real trading, but by a few years later, the days of anything even vaguely resembling actual trading advice are long gone. And, don't get me wrong, people really DID used to treat it seriously and at least act as though they were discussing advanced trading strategies and shit. A post from 2015 that was randomly re-posted here a few days ago turned up comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3odxi6/wsb_pleb_crisis_2015/cvwho8t/) that make my point clear — it really was SUPPOSED to be a place for gambling-minded traders to argue about the best way to potentially 10x their capital. (Minor aside: the sub also got majorly into Martin Shkreli around that time, and followed his live-streamed trading philosophy religiously, especially in between when he was sentenced and when he actually started serving his jail sentence. If you saw people defending him on Reddit at that time, it was probably some WSBer. Or me. Whoops.) The point I just really want to stress that the sub was actually intended to, and sort of used to be, a trading sub that was bad at it (that also had an occasional meme), and NOT a meme sub that was good at it (and also had an occasional trade).   Robinhood's launch was the real catalyst that sent us headlong down the path to where we are today. Commission-free trades and no account minimums meant that literally any idiot with a hundred bucks could bet on options like the big boys. Stories of complete losses kept pouring in, propped up forever by the occasional tales of massive gains. It was fun to watch. Just like before, it was dumb in a way you could still pretty easily wrap your head around.   This year, though, shit started hitting the fan (mainly for Robinhood, but also for any hope you may have had for humanity) when /u/1ronyman used something called a box spread to get himself $58k in debt, despite having only deposited $5k in the first place, before his account got shut down. Somehow he actually managed to withdraw $10k before that happened, so he actually profited on the whole situation. He's the original chief idiot of 2019, but he's also something of a legend to us old-timers. Robinhood completely banned box spreads on the platform due to him.   That all brings us to the last couple weeks. First, /u/controlthenarrative found, exploited, and reported on ANOTHER issue with Robinhood's platform, once again to the tune of around $50k. Essentially, he got RH to accidentally loan him tens of thousands of dollars on around $2k of collateral. He followed in the footsteps of /u/1ronyman and ALSO bet on Apple crashing. Once again, it did not do that. The trade blew up in his face, we all laughed about it, but ultimately everyone realized it was a serious matter, so by the time Robinhood promptly patched the bug everyone had learned a good lesson about risk.   Just kidding! Robinhood did NOTHING, everyone learned NOTHING, and /u/woodc93 used the same exploit to open a $350k position on a $5,000 deposit! Imagine going to buy a $350k house, giving the bank $5k as a downpayment without even so much as showing them your credit score, and walking out the door like all was well with the world. Well, /u/woodc93 did exactly that. And, wouldn't you know it, he ALSO BET ON APPLE CRASHING, WHICH IS NOT A GOOD BET, I MEAN SERIOUSLY BET ON ANYTHING ELSE OH MY GOD ARE YOU JOKING. Apple again did not crash, so he lost it all and got himself way in debt. Now, FINALLY, Robinhood realized their enormous (and illegal) mistake, tucked their tail between their legs, fixed the issue, and reprimanded everyone involved.   JUST KIDDING!! Robinhood did NOTHING! So /u/MoonYachts took that as an invitation to attempt to get Robinhood to loan him ONE MILLION DOLLARS on a $4,000 deposit. Obviously this would never work at any brokerage firm. Except of course it did work because it's just a million dollars and what's the worst thing that can happen ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. To his credit, he must have decided that betting on Apple's demise like his forefathers before him was a poor idea, so he instead invested it all in Ford stock. Of all things. Whatever. Regardless, I don't even know if anyone here knows what the result of that one was, but it is exceedingly likely that he, too, will wind up  dramatically in debt with nothing but a metric shitload of Reddit Gold to show for it. But at LEAST this time we'd finally hit the real limit, a legit million dollars, and Robinhood finally wised up and fixed the problem.   JUST FUCKING KIDDING DID YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE ME THAT TIME‽ LITERALLY A FEW HOURS LATER /u/call_warrior SET A NEW ""RECORD"" BY BORROWING OVER $1.7 MILLION ON A $4,000 DEPOSIT. I don't even have enough sarcasm for this anymore. At the rate we're going now, Robinhood is going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars (at least) in debt, there's going to be an SEC investigation, the entire platform could get shut down, and pigs may actually start flying. There's literally no way to even guess what's going to happen next in this sub, honestly, because every step that has been taken so far has been a whole order of magnitude dumber than the last.   When you take a step back, it's an incredible environment, remarkable that it even exists. It's a group of monkeys at a Bloomberg terminal with an enormous crowd of bystanders egging them on to throw even more of their shit at the keyboard. The whole situation really shows you just how dangerous a clever idiot can be, especially when that idiot has a $7B+ company seemingly egging them on to do something crazier than perhaps anyone in the history of finance has been able to do on only a few thousand dollars of their own capital. The history lesson is the important backdrop that, in my opinion, is a microcosm of our society as a whole: 5 years ago, people would lose $5k of their own money and get at least somewhat sad about it, but now people are INTENTIONALLY blowing that $5k of their own money in order to take out illicit loans from Robinhood for LITERALLY OVER A MILLION DOLLARS, knowing full well they're almost certain to get themselves deeply in debt, risking a serious SEC investigation, and even expecting bankruptcy, ALL FOR THE MEMES. To say the stupidity is brazen is an understatement. Honestly, it's beautiful, and I'm just glad I've been along for the ride. Godspeed, and I'll see you when someone finds a way to lose $10M in a weekend."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|725696|public|confidence|self|A brief history of WallStreetBets (for all of you who joined during the era of infinite money and have no idea what this sub was originally for or how we got to here)|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv3sld/a_brief_history_of_wallstreetbets_for_all_of_you/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||[]||||2019-11-12|FORD

So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|697206|public|confidence|self|How to make unlimited tendies|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq7cfc/how_to_make_unlimited_tendies/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||[]|1572715352.0|||2019-11-01|FORD

On a related note, the Bank of Japan left its policy rates unchanged but signaled a willingness to cut rates in the future.   The trade headline, however, appears to be increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries, which is driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield is down six basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.29. WTI crude is down 0.9%, or $0.49, to $54.56/bbl.   In economic data, investors will receive the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 216,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Employment Cost Index for the third quarter (Briefing.com consensus 0.7%), and the Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) report for September at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Chicago PMI for October (Briefing.com consensus 48.2) will be released at 9:45 a.m. ET.  In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Apple** (AAPL 247.10, +3.84): +1.6% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and guiding the midpoint of Q1 revenue above consensus.  * **Facebook** (FB 195.80, +7.55): +4.0% after beating top and bottom-line estimates.  * **Starbucks** (SBUX 86.51, +2.32): +2.8% despite reporting in-line results and guiding FY20 EPS below consensus.  * **Altria** (MO 46.50, +0.54): +1.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and writing down its Juul investment by $4.5 billion.  * **Lyft** (LYFT 45.86, +1.75): +4.0% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, guiding Q4 revenue above consensus, and raising its Adj.

The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn't in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31.

Economic data was unimpressive, though, as Q3 GDP growth slowed in South Korea and Japan's preliminary manufacturing PMI for October slipped further into contraction territory with a reading of 48.5 (prior 48.9). Separately, The Bank of Indonesia cut its key lending rate 25 basis points, as expected, to 5.00%.  * In economic data:    * South Korea's Q3 GDP +0.4% qtr/qtr (expected +0.5%; last +1.0%)    * Japan's prelim.

Automaker Daimler is seeing a nice bid after its third quarter report and is helping to lend support, yet Nokia is a major laggard in European action after cutting its outlook for 2019 and 2020.

The options are dirt fuckin' cheap and the stock itself has been relatively stable, leading to potentially great earnings on iron condors or whatever have you. I certainly wouldn't say you should buy their stock because I'm a Michigan boy and we've been burned by them one too many times to begin with, also this is WSB who the FUCK buys stocks these days when the tendies are in options?  That said I believe this upcoming earnings report on Wednesday (10/23) is the perfect opportunity for it to either rally or fall. It's been a very tough quarter for auto makers in the U.S. due to the strikes but that was mostly GM who took the brunt of the hit (hint: $GM 10/29). HOWEVER Ford itself is like the ugly kid on the play ground and despite everything his competitor's face he's the one who gets bullied by the chad stonk investors.   Today it was downgraded by [some nerds](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/98f50487-0458-3227-9ed7-404245c16afe/ford-stock%3A-valuengine.html) from 'sell' to 'strong sell' but of course this isn't priced in to the earnings call. What prompted this was the botched release of some [boomer-mobile](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-botches-explorer-launch-putting-100000028.html) which is believed to drive the stock downward much further. This won't effect this quarter either, so be sure to put your puts in for next earnings.  It's been a shitty quarter for all automakers, but I think that will ultimately be Ford's best bet at a rally on Wednesday, as compared to their counterparts they've had a quite tame time. At the same time I don't trust them one single fuckin' bit to pull through. This quarter is make or break for the stock to get past 10$, or consign itself as a penny stock at sub $5.  Having mixed feelings, I'm running a strangle and hoping it goes down as the calls were less expensive than the puts and therefore I stand to earn more. If you're new and take the religious route of inversing WSB, an iron condor is what you want but if you're Iron Condor'ing on earnings week you definitely belong here.  That all being said, next earnings if they continue to have a rough time it'll definitely be worth considering some major OTM puts.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|686581|public|confidence|self|$F for Ford?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl7q76/f_for_ford/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||[]|1572180843.0|||2019-10-21|FORD

(LEN + $1.49 to $57.21) after the Miami-based home builder reported Q3 earnings of $1.59 per share ($0.27 beat) on revenue that rose 3.3% year-over-year to $5.86B (above the $5.48B expected). Deliveries increased 7% to 13,522 homes while new orders increased 9% to 13,369 new homes. Shares of LEN are trading at a 52-week high this morning and from a technical perspective, it appears that the stock is breaking out (to the upside) from a longer-term (bullish) inverse head and shoulders pattern. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the October 18th 57.50 call topping the most actives list (volume is 1,505).     Also trading to the upside is Dow-component Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. (JNJ + $3.12 to $133.11) following news that the drug maker announced a settlement with two Ohio counties ahead of an upcoming opioid trial. Under the terms of the settlement, JNJ will make a combined $10M settlement payment to the counties, reimburse $5M in legal fees and provide a $5.4M charitable contribution to non-profit organizations in connection with opioid-related programs in these two counties. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the November 15th 130.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 4,464).     New 52-week highs (8 new highs today): American Homes 4 Rent Inc. (AMH + $0.04 to $25.89), HCP Inc. (HCP + $0.04 to $35.75), Pultegroup Inc. (PHM - $0.31 to $36.12)  Notable Call Activity  A couple of drug makers are seeing some unusual call activity this morning, perhaps in response to the JNJ news mentioned above:  Mylan N.V. (MYL - $0.36 to $18.47): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 7:1 which is primarily being driven by a 20K block that was bought on the November 15th 20.00 call at the ask price of $1.12 (open interest is 1,413). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TEVA + $0.22 to $6.98): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 3:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 8.00 call (volume is 11,949 vs. open interest 829). However, the majority of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold at various times at the bid prices of $0.33 and $0.34, which suggests that these call sellers don’t see TEVA closing above the $8.00 price level at expiration.      Today’s Bearish Activity   Leading the point decliners list over on the NYSE this morning is Acuity Brands Inc. (AYI - $20.80 to $109.66) after the lighting and building management solutions company reported fiscal Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.75 ($0.06 miss) on net sales of $938.1M (below the $1.03B expected). Shares of AYI are trading at the lowest levels since last December where it got as low as $103.48, which represent a five-year low. Puts are slightly outnumbering calls but the October 18th 135.00 call is the most actively traded contract (volume is 153).  Also trading to the downside is Stitch Fix Inc. (SFIX - $2.71 to $17.35) after the online fashion stylist site reported fiscal Q4 earnings of $0.07 per share ($0.03 beat) on revenue that rose 35.8% year-over-year to $432.1M (roughly in-line with the $432.44M consensus estimate) as net revenue per active client increased 9.0% year-over-year to $488. The company issued downside Q3 revenue guidance of $438-442M (vs. the $451.29M consensus estimate) and in-line full-year 2020 revenue guidance of $1.90-1.93B (vs. the $1.92B consensus estimate). If you read Monday’s blog you might recall that SFIX was highlighted under “Volume Signals” for unusual put buying on the October 18th 14.00 put. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the January 2020 80.00 put leading the way (volume is 50).         New 52-week lows (163 new lows today): Abiomed Inc. (ABMD - $2.04 to $168.17), CBS Corp. (CBS - $0.77 to $39.40), Teredata Corp. (TDC - $0.49 to $29.53), Viacom Inc.-Class A (VIA - $0.51 to $25.74)  Notable Put Activity  Some unusual put activity (better than 3:1 over calls) is being seen in Ford Motor Co. (F - $0.35 to $8.54) which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 8.00 put. Volume on this contract is 43,158 (vs. open interest of 701) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being sold at the bid price of $0.20 and $0.21, including a 30.78K block that was sold at the bid price of $0.20. We know this ~30K block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader either believes that F will remain at or above $8.00 or is comfortable taking a long ~3.08M share position in the stock at an effective purchase price of $7.80 in the event that it closes below $8.00 at expiration.    Walmart Inc. (WMT - $1.17 to $116.68): Puts are outpacing calls better than 5:1 which is primarily being drive by a 12.30K block that was sold on the January 2020 105.00 put at the bid price of $1.34 (open interest is 8,501). We know this 12.30K block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader either believes that WMT will remain at or above $105.00 or is comfortable taking a long 1.23M share position in the stock at an effective purchase price of $103.66 in the event that it closes below $105.00 at expiration.    Volume Signals       Huntsman Corp. (HUN - $0.35 to $22.11): Option volume is running at over 20x the daily average of 192 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of fairly large blocks that simultaneously traded out on the November 15th expiration:  23.00 call – a 1,250 block traded for $1.05, directly in the middle of the $1.00 x $1.10 bid/ask spread (open interest is 404) 25.00 call – a 2,500 block was sold for $0.39 (open interest is 325) We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a call front spread was established for a net debit of $0.27 (x 1,250 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that HUN can rally higher in the coming months and close at or near the maximum gain price of exactly $25.00 at expiration.    Fidelity National Information Services (FIS - $2.19 to $129.07): Option volume is running at roughly 16x the daily average of 249 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 2,878 block that was bought on the November 15th 130.00 call at the ask price of $5.50 (open interest is 2,702). We know this block is a new position and we can assume that the block trader believes that FIS will close above the break-even price of $135.50 at expiration.    Borg Warner Inc. (BWA - $1.14 to $34.79): Option volume is running at roughly 8x the daily average of 442 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 27.50 put. Volume on this contract is 3,001 versus open interest of 171, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. Nearly all of the volume on this contract is being attributed to a 1,800 block that was bought for $0.45 and (around the same time) a 1,200 block that was bought for $0.50 when the bid/ask spread was $0.00 x $0.60 (both suggesting bearish intent).    Gauging Volatility  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 2.30 to 20.86) has been in positive territory all day today (intraday range is 18.75-21.07) as equity markets remain in risk-off mode around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 483, SPX - 51, COMPX - 128). VIX option volume has been above average today at 364,466 contracts (#4 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.50). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 35.00 call as volume is 50,364 versus open interest of 88,079.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|663758|public|confidence|self|Options market 10-2-19|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dccw8v/options_market_10219/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||[]|1570121375.0|||2019-10-02|FORD

That's PAWN SHOP RATES, bruhs.  The Fed says ""oh well its end of quarter tax payments!"".  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  These assholes are lying to you.  This is the beginning of a **corporate debt crisis** of untold magnitude originally began with ZIRP and ""chasing yield"" that allowed highly capital intensive corporations like F to continuously roll over their ""high grade"" corporate debt for pennies on the dollar.    &amp;#x200B;  The last three nights was just the beginning and it's going to get much worse.  ZIRP (that's zero interest rate policy for the morons that just started reading books) allowed corporations to issue massive amounts of corporate debt for pennies on the dollar as investors chased real yields.  These corporate debt coupons are paid monthly, quarterly or annually just like the mortgage and property tax you pay on the shitty fixer-upper you bought after binging on HGTV for a few days.  When they pay these coupons they need **COLD HARD CASH** just like you do, and if there's a cash crunch they can borrow it from overnight repo markets by putting up an asset (collateral) and retrieving cash (fucking cash) and then repay it overnight--hence ""REPO"" = ""REPOSSESSIVE"".  Are you still reading?  Keep fucking reading.  &amp;#x200B;  Well guess what?  Three days ago CORPORATIONS NEEDED CASH SO BAD THEY HAD TO PAY UPWARDS OF 9% BEFORE THE FED JUST PRINTED 86 BILLION OUT OF THIN AIR.

Rising material costs.  Oil shock.  What the fuck does this have to do with the peso?  &amp;#x200B;  In order to keep paying the corporate debt coupons, they will need to improve cash flow by having a firesale on assets and converting them to USD to pay their bond holders (PAID IN CASH--USD--NOT PESOS).

The S&amp;P 500 enters today's session less than 20 points from that level, helped by a view that trade tensions will not worsen in the short term, U.S. consumer spending will support further growth, and that easy monetary policy will continue to favor equities.   Today's trade news involves China's *Xinhua News Agency* confirming that China will encourage companies to buy certain agricultural products like pork and soybeans from the U.S. without being subject to additional tariffs.

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.  For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.  At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to **Apple's** (**AAPL** 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it is expected to unveil its latest iPhone.   In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.  U.S. Treasuries are slightly lower, nudging yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.45. WTI crude is up 1.0% to $58.42/bbl, which could continue to benefit the oil-sensitive energy stocks that have bounced back this month.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Apple** (AAPL 213.73, -0.44): -0.2% ahead of its annual Special Event at 1:00 p.m. ET.  * **Wendy's** (WEN 20.00, -1.95): -8.9% after lowering its earnings guidance to reflect costs incurred to launch a breakfast menu in 2020.  * **Ford Motor** (F 9.19, -0.35): -3.7% after Moody's downgraded its senior unsecured rating to Ba1, or ""junk rating,"" from Baa3.   Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. Japan's Nikkei +0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng UNCH, China's Shanghai Composite -0.1%, India's Sensex Closed for Moharram, South Korea's Kospi +0.6%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.    * In economic data:       * China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

During the August period, the IMX increased to 4.62, up 0.02 or 0.4%, from the previous period.  During the August period, TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers overall, and net buyers of equities for the first time in three months. Net buying of equities helped increase the IMX slightly month-over-month, with clients also net buyers of less risky assets, including fixed-income products. Volatility of the S&amp;P 500 spiked during the period, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which reached the mid-20s for the first time since January.  Equity market returns were negative during the period, with the S&amp;P 500 moving lower by 3.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2.9%. The Tech sector was particularly volatile, with the Nasdaq Composite lower by 4.4%. Equity markets were influenced by a horde of news during the period. The tariff war with China heated up, with each country announcing plans for further escalation. Consumer confidence posted the lowest number since 2016, and the biggest monthly drop since 2012. For the first time since 2007, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield curve inverted, while the 30-year yield also reached the lowest level ever. Among positive news, manufacturing activity, measured by the Chicago PMI, rebounded back to expansionary territory following a six-point jump from July's three-and-a-half year low. Also, consumer prices rose broadly, with core inflation hitting 2.2%.  **Trading**  TD Ameritrade clients seemed to use the volatility during the August IMX period to purchase certain names. Walt Disney Company (DIS) was a net buy after it traded lower by 5% during the period, and it announced a partnership with Target (TGT) to open Disney stores within Target stores. Amazon Inc. (AMZN) traded lower by 8.5% during the period and has fallen for six straight weeks, and was net bought. Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) was a net buy, with the federal government announcing a massive 10-year, $7.6 billion computing contract to a trio of vendors to provide Microsoft office software for the Pentagon. Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) paused it's upward run during the period, trading lower by over 25% after hitting an all-time high during July, and was a net buy. UBER Technologies Inc. (UBER) reached a new low since its IPO in May as the company continues to come under fire to reclassify drivers as employees instead of freelancers, and was net bought.  Additional popular names bought include Ford Motor Company (F), BP (BP), and Abbvie Inc. (ABBV).  Although they were net buyers, TD Ameritrade clients found some names to sell during the August period. Apple Inc. (AAPL) was net sold for the third month in a row as the company announced plans to start online sales in India. Semiconductor makers Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) were both net sells during the period. Both stocks received analyst upgrades during the period, and were pressured by the tariff tension with China. Corteva Inc. (CTVA), the agricultural input provider that was spun off from Dupont (DD), saw a volatile period after the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated its crop production estimates for the coming harvest, and was net sold. AT&amp;T Inc. (T) was a net sell after the stock reached a 52-week high during the period as the company reached a multi-year content carriage agreement with Starz. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) beat on earnings and raised their dividend, and was net sold.  Additional names sold include Wabtec Corp. (WAB), Dupont de Nemours Inc. (DD), and Siri XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI).  Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.  **About the IMX**  The Investor Movement Index, or the IMX, is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.  The IMX does this by using data including holdings/positions, trading activity, and other data from a sample of our 11 million funded client accounts.  It’s best to review IMX trends over time, rather than focusing on one month’s score. If a score increases month over month, that likely means that investors are getting more bullish. If a score decreases month over month, that can either mean that investors are becoming bearish, or that they are less bullish than before. There are no defined bullish/bearish thresholds for the index. Scores should be viewed relative to other periods – the more scores you consider, the more likely you are to see trends that can be compared to other indices or market dynamics.  For example: If the index decreased from one month to the next after hitting a new high, that may be because investors are taking profits and reducing exposure to the market. But relative to other periods, the score is still high – indicating that portfolios are still bullish.  While the IMX can help provide insight into individual investor behavior, it cannot predict the direction of the market. It provides a snapshot of what individual investors are currently doing within their portfolios. This snapshot, when viewed over time, can be used to suggest a bullish or bearish sentiment on the part of retail investors.  *Source: TD Ameritrade*  -----  Let me know if this is good information and I can share these on a monthly basis when they're updated.

I informed this autist that Faceplace is Instagram for old dried up Beckies which got me thinking.   I crushed an addy and here we have it   My autists, I give you the $KAREN  1. Target: the stomping grounds of middle class Karen's everywhere. Shits slightly more expensive than Walmart, so it gives them a feeling of status, like they used to have when they were young and hot. Pre popping out some crotch spawn and going from and hourglass figure to rectangle.   2. Kohl's: This joint is the shitty discounted version of Lulu  3. Starbucks: the bucks transcends a single index because it really is a defining character trait of Karen's worldwide. Couldn't not include it.  4. Adidas: back when Karen's were still hot (1990) adidas was popping on the hip hop scene, which made it cool. Karen still buys their shit because at this point she's conditioned to.  5. Facebook: Karen got on this train late, attempting to follow in the footsteps of her BECKY daughter, who had already moved to IG. The fact the people have to actually mutually follow each other made it so Karen can actually get a following. No one on IG pays attention to 40 year old #supermoms #bossbabes #queens. They literally exist to validate each other. Therefore Karen gets her dopamine fix from shit posting on FB.  6. Toyota: this one bites because personally I love their trucks. The Rav4 is the slightly cooler CRV that lower class Karen's can expect after 10 years of driving a ford windstar mini van. They also offer the 4runner, which is retardedly expensive but guarantees the kids can drive through the jungles of 'Nam and make it to soccer practice on time if the situation requires. Great for hauling groceries or sudden civil unrest.

In the dot-com bubble the stocks and earnings of tech related companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel,.. non dot-com companies where hugly affected by the mania. Other then Cisco those Companies had an elevated P/E ratio but nothing as crazy as the dot-coms and was based on huge revenue and earnings growth largly by dot-coms buying hardware/software from those companies.  [March 2000:](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2986486-15-years-after-bubble-burst-tech-stocks-competitively-priced)  || CSCO| MSFT | INTC | ORCL | IBM | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |P/E| 221.7| 65.9 | 27.4 | 21.4 | 28.4 | |Market Cap|$591.4B|$620.0B|$341.4B|$135.0B|$229.7B|  So at the time it was pretty reasonable to be long those companies because of the real income they generated, if you didn't account from where the money was really coming from.  &amp;#x200B;  Similar example now with money burning Electric Scooter sharing companies:  * [Lime valuation $2.4b with $765m in total funding](https://growjo.com/company/Lime) * [Bird valuation of $2b with $415m in total funding](https://growjo.com/company/Bird) * [Uber, Lyft and Ford going in too](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/23/the-electric-scooter-wars-of-2018/)  The capital spend mostly trickles down the supply chain to [Ninebot who bought Segway for $75m in 2015 and sold 1M Scooters in 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/30/tech/segway-history/index.html) . Plus Bird [said](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18141418/scooter-vandalism-rugged-bird-lime-spin-acton) its electric scooters tend to last one to two months before they need to be replaced. Lime’s scooters have a similar lifespan. This lunacy is just one part of the current misallocation of VC money which leads to misallocation in the supply chain. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  &amp;#x200B;  There are now [376 private unicorn startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies) ($1b+ valuation) in the world with a total market cap of $1.2t. The total capital invested worldwide by VCs in [2018 was $254b and $65b just in Q4 2018](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg-venture-pulse-q4-2018.pdf). Just for comparision the US VC investing in 2000, which was largly equilivant to global VC spend because Asia and Europe was to small, reached a peak of [$120b](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-08/venture-capital-still-flowing-to-silicon-valley-and-bay-area) in that year.   When you exclude Asia from [what VC invested in the last 6 years was](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg-venture-pulse-q4-2018.pdf):  |Year|Quarter|US in Billion $|Europe in Billion $|Total EU+US|Mean Total| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |2013|Q1|11|2.5 |13.5 |14.2 | ||Q2|11 |3.3 |14.3 || ||Q3|11 |2.9 |13.9 || ||Q4|12 |3 |15 || |2014|Q1|15 |3.5 |18.5 |21.4 | ||Q2|20 |3.5 |23.5 || ||Q3|16 |4.2 |20.2 || ||Q4|20 |3.4 |23.4 || |2015|Q1|21 |4.5 |25.5 |25.4 | ||Q2|20 |4.3 |24.3 || ||Q3|24 |5.5 |29.5 || ||Q4|18 |4.2 |22.2 || |2016|Q1|20 |5.5 |25.5 |24.0 | ||Q2|25 |4.7 |29.7 || ||Q3|17 |4.5 |21.5 || ||Q4|15 |4.1 |19.1 || |2017|Q1|16 |4.3 |20.3 |26.0 | ||Q2|21 |6.2 |27.2 || ||Q3|25 |5.1 |30.1 || ||Q4|20 |6.3 |26.3 || |2018|Q1|30 |6.3 |36.3 |38.8| ||Q2|28 |6.3 |34.3 || ||Q3|31 |5.6 |36.6 || ||Q4|42 |5.9 |47.9 ||  &amp;#x200B;  This is 174% (248% when Asia is included) growth over 6 years, or 18% YoY, vs 75% with S&amp;P500 or 128% with nasdaq in the same timeframe (Jan 2013 - Jan 2019).   So where is all the money going and how much of it is ending on public balance sheets?  Next to employees, as the biggest expense, is Sales &amp; Marketing and tech stack. I assume 40% goes to employees wages 20% S&amp;M, 20% tech and 20% other.   Now how fast are they spending their invested capital? [Monthly Burn rate  for different startup funding phases](https://brex.com/blog/state-of-spend/).  * Pre-Seed: 48% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $18k. * Seed: 65% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $50k and an average capital raise of $1.1m =&gt; They spend 4.5% of their capital per month * Series A: 47% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $400k and an average capital raise of $8m =&gt; They spend 5% of capital per month  * Startups which succeeded to exist/raise capital after Series A: 50% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $900k raise on average $16.5m =&gt; They spend 5.5% of capital per month   So a typical startup spends about 15% per Quarter of its invested capital plus its generated revenues, which I neglect from this calculation. $47.9b in one quarter invested from VC then leads to $7.2b additional money spend per quarter for roughly 6 quarters. So tanking the numbers above this leads to:  &amp;#x200B;  |Year|Quarter|Additional 15% burn rate capital for 6Q in Billion $|Cumulated spend over 6Q in Billion $| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |2013|Q1|2.0 |2.0 | ||Q2|2.1 |4.2 | ||Q3|2.1 |6.3 | ||Q4|2.3 |8.5 | |2014|Q1|2.8 |11.3 | ||Q2|3.5 |14.8 | ||Q3|3.0 |15.8 | ||Q4|3.5 |17.2 | |2015|Q1|3.8 |18.9 | ||Q2|3.6 |20.3 | ||Q3|4.4 |22.0 | ||Q4|3.3 |21.8 | |2016|Q1|3.8 |22.6 | ||Q2|4.5 |23.5 | ||Q3|3.2 |22.9 | ||Q4|2.9 |22.1 | |2017|Q1|3.0 |20.7 | ||Q2|4.1 |21.5 | ||Q3|4.5 |22.2 | ||Q4|3.9 |21.7 | |2018|Q1|5.4 |23.9 | ||Q2|5.1 |26.2 | ||Q3|5.5 |28.6 | ||Q4|7.2 |31.7 |  &amp;#x200B;  So in Q4 2018 approx. $32b was burned by startups, now I use the assumption that 20% of this, about $6.3b, is spend on Sales &amp; Marketing and $6.3b is spend on IT. I also use the [Googles](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/) and [Facebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271258/facebooks-advertising-revenue-worldwide/) yearly advertising revenues and average down to a Quarter from 2016 - 2018:  &amp;#x200B;  |Year|Quarter|Per quarter average Google+Fb revenue in Billion $|20% Percent of  Cumulated VC spend for S&amp;M in Billion $|Ratio| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |2016|Q1|26.57 |4.5 |16.98% | ||Q2|26.57 |4.7 |17.69% | ||Q3|26.57 |4.6 |17.24% | ||Q4|26.57 |4.4 |16.66% | |2017|Q1|33.83 |4.1 |12.26% | ||Q2|33.83 |4.3 |12.71% | ||Q3|33.83 |4.4 |13.12% | ||Q4|33.83 |4.3 |12.81% | |2018|Q1|42.83 |4.8 |11.16% | ||Q2|42.83 |5.2 |12.22% | ||Q3|42.83 |5.7 |13.36% | ||Q4|42.83 |6.3 |14.81% |  So Googles and Facebooks Adverting business would have 12-15% exposure to Venture Capital induced spending.  And Cloud?  AWS has a cloud [market share of 32.3%](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/cloud-market-share-q4-2018-and-full-year-2018) in Q4 2018. I'm using this [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250520/forecast-of-amazon-web-services-revenue/) for their Quarterly revenues. So I'm assuming 32% of the 20% IT budget for AWS:  &amp;#x200B;  |Year|Quarter|AWS Revenue in Billion $|Startups IT budget in Billion $|Ratio| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |2016|Q1|2.6 |1.4 |55.53% | ||Q2|2.9 |1.5 |51.87% | ||Q3|3.2 |1.5 |45.81% | ||Q4|3.5 |1.4 |40.46% | |2017|Q1|3.7 |1.3 |35.88% | ||Q2|4.1 |1.4 |33.55% | ||Q3|4.6 |1.4 |30.87% | ||Q4|5.1 |1.4 |27.20% | |2018|Q1|5.4 |1.5 |28.32% | ||Q2|6.1 |1.7 |27.46% | ||Q3|6.7 |1.8 |27.34% | ||Q4|7.4 |2.0 |27.44% |  &amp;#x200B;  So AWS would have approx. 30% exposure to VC funded Startup revenue.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 8th, 2019.  # **The week ahead: Powell’s testimony could make or break the stock rally  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/the-week-ahead-powells-testimony-could-make-or-break-the-stock-rally.html)** ***** &gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to reinforce market expectations for a late July rate cut or rein them in when he speaks to Congress in the week ahead. ***** &gt; Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and at the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, and is expected to answer questions on the economy and Fed policy. ***** &gt; His testimony comes after a strong June jobs report raised questions about whether the Fed will actually cut rates this month. The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold. ***** &gt; The report was “stronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed’s anticipated cut in 26 days,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31. ***** &gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported. ***** &gt; But Powell’s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected. ***** &gt; “It’s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market’s dovishness here?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “The one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they’re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.” ***** &gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%. ***** &gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn’t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July. ***** &gt; “I personally don’t see the case for an ease right now,” said Stanley. “Do they passively accept the market’s verdict or do they push back, in that they’re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market’s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.” ***** &gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates. ***** &gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. “There are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there’s no easy answer,” said Swonk. “Jay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.” ***** &gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. “All you need is uncertainty. You’ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You’ve got that,” she said. “You’ve got all these things lining up.” ***** &gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. “They want insurance, but they don’t want to give away the house,” she said. ***** &gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead.

Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half – after a tepid market action in Q3.  &gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow’s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% – S&amp;P’s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03798f3a59e96e715850d320de656a38/tumblr_inline_ptzkf9dPpp1spdppr_500.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2357ff4a6353191f4a1175180f5a73b7/tumblr_inline_ptzkfk43391spdppr_500.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35b5389f967e61f1fa8e449677e307aa/tumblr_inline_ptzkiw6g3s1spdppr_500.jpg))**  *****  # S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019  &gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the ""big three"" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weightings.png))**  &gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sector-weightings.png))**  *****  # Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks  &gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.  &gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl's (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.  &gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy's (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.  &gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spx500.png))**  &gt; Below we have input the list of heavily shorted stocks into a custom portfolio that Bespoke members can create when they're logged into our website.

Today's 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn't a voter) just noted in a speech that she's in no hurry to cut. She argues that ""Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive.""  &gt; What would cause her to change her stance? “If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.” A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070219-Yield-Curve.png))**  *****  # Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down  &gt; “If you’re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That’s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.  &gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. “Is 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn’t had a recession for nearly 28 years,” according to Detrick. “Not to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.”  &gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it’s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn’t so old?  &gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/826zZSV.jpg))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 5th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET UP!)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 07.7.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUYuuW6kYVE))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in July-  *****  &gt; * **$NFLX**  &gt; * **$BA**  &gt; * **$F**  &gt; * **$UNH**  &gt; * **$INTC**  &gt; * **$T**  &gt; * **$CLF**  &gt; * **$BAC**  &gt; * **$PEP**  &gt; * **$GOOGL**  &gt; * **$AEMD**  &gt; * **$DAL**  &gt; * **$JPM**  &gt; * **$C**  &gt; * **$SMPL**  &gt; * **$HAL**  &gt; * **$WFC**  &gt; * **$IRBT**  &gt; * **$AYI**  &gt; * **$JNJ**  &gt; * **$MMM**  &gt; * **$BBBY**  &gt; * **$YRD**  &gt; * **$NOK**  &gt; * **$ISCA**  &gt; * **$CAT**  &gt; * **$CMG**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$KO**  &gt; * **$MA**  &gt; * **$LEVI**  &gt; * **$BMY**  &gt; * **$SLB**  &gt; * **$INFY**  &gt; * **$OMN**  &gt; * **$GS** &gt; * **$CSX**  &gt; * **$PGR**  &gt; * **$UPS**  &gt; * **$ERIC**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$AA**  &gt; * **$CNC**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xmzSnnx.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NNrT29C.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Sy9VT1Z.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ses5tRb.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQP0M9U.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ePT21m9.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YYKTKJK.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WwTFpZ9.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gwEMWHy.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yv5qORt.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Kraft Heinz Company $31.04  &gt; **Kraft Heinz Company (KHC)** is expected to report earnings at approximately 5:00 PM ET on Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019.  # **What to watch in markets for the week ahead: After G-20, focus shifts to jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/what-to-watch-in-markets-for-the-week-ahead-after-g-20-focus-shifts-to-jobs-report.html)** ***** &gt; The monthly jobs number is always important but this time, it could be even bigger news, since it may actually help tell us how much the Fed will cut interest rates this summer. ***** &gt; The report won’t be the only bit of data the Fed will look at before it meets July 30-31, but it could show whether the economy has hit a weak enough streak in hiring that the Fed will want to act. ***** &gt; Economists expect that 158,000 jobs were created in June, up sharply from the disappointing 75,000 in May, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3%. ***** &gt; “It’s going to be better than last month. Otherwise, we’ve got a problem,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis Americas. “We’re saying it’s something like 130,000. If it’s weak, the markets are going to assume the Fed’s going 50 [basis points]. If you have a number in June, like you had in May, they would go 50.” ***** &gt; After the weekend’s G-20 headlines, the jobs report is the big focus for markets in the coming week, along with OPEC’s two-day meeting Monday and Tuesday. OPEC is widely expected to extend 1.2 million barrels a day in production cuts in a deal with Russia, and oil isn’t expected to react much, unless there’s a surprise. ***** &gt; Markets also kick off the third quarter in the holiday-shortened Fourth of July week, after one of the best first halves in more than 20 years for stocks. ***** &gt; The jobs report follows some other important data in the coming week, and comes as the slowing in the economy is taking a worrisome turn and beginning to hit some of the consumer-related data. A lagging indicator, the jobs data may provide some guidance on the well-being of consumers, which drive about 70% of the U.S. economy. ***** &gt; Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment readings in June were weaker amid concerns about trade. Consumer spending increased just 0.2% in May, leading some economists on Friday to slash their expectations for both consumption in the second quarter and second quarter economic growth. J.P. Morgan economists trimmed their second quarter GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9% ***** &gt; The economy now exits the second quarter, and first half of the year, with some big doubts hanging over the outlook. That makes some of the data in the coming week, the first week of the third quarter, even more relevant. For instance, ISM manufacturing and PMI manufacturing data are released Monday. Both are important to the outlook or the manufacturing sector, which has been weak. Car sales are released Tuesday, and they will also be an important look into manufacturing and the consumer. ***** &gt; “If the jobs number is good but let’s say the CPI and retail sales data turns out to be a lot softer, or GDP revised meaningfully down, it’s not just employment. The possibility of the Fed doing more than 25 [basis points] does not end with the employment report,” LaVorgna said. ***** &gt; The May jobs report was an important turning point for markets, changing the minority view of some economists that the Fed could cut interest rates into a consensus expectation. But that consensus has not settled on when and how much the Fed will chop rate. ***** &gt; The Fed signaled after its June meeting that it was leaning toward a cut, exiting its neutral posture, and that it could act soon if it had to. ***** &gt; So the jobs report, “is important for better or worse. The market’s been bullying the Fed for the last couple of decades and if anything, it’s gotten even more powerful. If it’s weak, the market is going to push them to do more, but the Fed will be fearful of disappointing the market. They’ll also be fearful the economy is weak against the backdrop of trade uncertainty,” said LaVorgna. ***** &gt; At this point, fed funds futures are pricing in a full quarter-point rate cut for the July meeting and a portion of a second cut. Economists mostly expect two cuts this year, whether starting in July or September, with another likely by either September or December. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vLg0YrK.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cpGJG5e.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OMBCnxB.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/icdbnZ8.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qzritvf.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PxxJq9E.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7sAo6Sh.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZCRsP8T.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LA02AwI.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())** NONE.  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/lckxzcG.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rtdblNh.png))**  *****  # July 4th Market Returns  &gt; With the first half winding down to a close, Summer is in full swing as July 4th quickly approaches. While the days leading up to or after July 4th are usually on the quiet side with many people taking vacations, for the stock market, it is usually a relatively positive week. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's performance during the July 4th week measuring performance from the Friday before July 4th until the Friday after. In years where July 4th falls on a Friday or Saturday, we measure the S&amp;P 500's performance in the week leading up to July 4th.  &gt; For the July 4th week, going back to 1969, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average gain of 0.32% with positive returns 60% of the time. In the charts below, we have also included green shading in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half (as it is this year). In those years, returns during the July 4th week have been much better with an average gain of 0.93% and positive returns 79% of the time. In fact, the last time the S&amp;P 500 was down during the July 4th week in a year where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half was in 1986!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Week.png))**  &gt; Similar to the July 4th week, the day before July 4th has also historically been positive but not nearly to the same degree. On those days, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.04% with positive returns only slightly more than half of the time (54%). In years where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the day before July 4th is considerably better, averaging a gain of 0.17% with gains 64% of the time.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-Before.png))**  &gt; With people out celebrating the July 4th holiday, the hangover sets in after. As shown below, the average S&amp;P 500 change on the trading day after July 4th is a decline of 0.18% with gains only 42% of the time. In years when the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the declines aren't as bad, but at -0.12% and gains only half of the time, they aren't positive either. This year the day after July 4th will also feature the June Non-Farm Payrolls report. That will be fun!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-After.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/28/19  &gt; In posts yesterday and Monday, we made note of the increasingly disappointing economic data out of the US relative to expectations so far in 2019. This week's data only added to the woes as the Citi Economic Surprise Index for the US now sits only 0.73% above its April low.  &gt; Over half of this week's releases came in worse than the prior period of estimates. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index was the first release this week showing improvements from the April data and coming in above estimates, but the indicator is still showing contracting activity (reading below zero). The Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also was out on Monday showing far weaker results. Later in the week, on Thursday, the Kansas City Fed released their own manufacturing activity index completing our Five Fed Composite which is painting a bleak picture for the manufacturing sector. There was also a good amount of housing data this week with overall solid results including stronger than expected home prices (via the FHFA index and S&amp;P CoreLogic's Case-Shiller Index) but disappointing new home sales on Tuesday, improved MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday, and a much better Pending Home Sales print on Thursday. Chicago PMI dropped below 50 on Friday, which is a sign of contraction, but Michigan Confidence beat estimates. One other major release this week was the third and final release of quarterly GDP, which held steady at 3.1% QoQ but was below estimates of an increase to 3.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco1.png))**  &gt; Despite a shortened week due to the July 4th holiday, next week is set up to be a busy one. On Monday, Markit will release their final June PMI on manufacturing alongside the ISM reading later that morning. While Markit measures on manufacturing are expected to hold steady at 50.1, ISM data is anticipated to fall 1.1 down to 51. The only release Tuesday will be data on vehicle sales, which are expected to fall to 17 mm SAAR. On Thursday, there will be no releases and US markets will be shuttered in observance of the July 4th holiday. Additionally, markets will close early (1:00 PM EST) on Wednesday. In spite of this shortened session and day off, there is a huge slug of data to be released Wednesday. Following up the manufacturing PMIs, Markit and ISM non-manufacturing indicators are all due out on Wednesday. In the late morning, final May data on Factory, Durable, and Capital Goods Orders are also going to be released. Alongside the standard Wednesday release of MBA Mortgage Applications, other weekly data that is typically released on Thursday will be pushed ahead one day including Initial Jobless Claims and Bloomberg Consumer Comfort. ADP employment numbers are expected to show improvements when it releases on Wednesday ahead of Friday's Nonfarm payrolls report, which is also forecasting a solid improvement from the previous month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco2.png))**  *****  # Trend Analyzer - 6/28/19 - Teetering On Overbought  &gt; After the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) set a new all-time high last Thursday, stocks have yet to make a push back above these levels as all of the major index ETFs sit below where they were at last Thursday's close. This pullback was partially a function of the large-cap major index ETFs like the Russell 1000 (IWB) working off overbought levels. Whereas all of these were overbought last week, currently only the Dow (DIA) still sits in overbought territory although other large caps are teetering on joining DIA. The Core S&amp;P Small Cap (IJR) and Micro Cap (IWC) are only lower by 0.41% and 0.33%, respectively. These are smaller losses compared to other ETFs which lost around 1%. Ironically, this outperformance also comes as IJR and IWC are now showing sideways trends rather uptrends across the rest of the ETFs. Granted, not all small-cap indices have been outperforming. Another small-cap index, the Russell 2000 (IWM), has seen performance more inline with other ETFs, declining 1.07%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA.png))**  &gt; Every sector except Materials (XLB) is lower over the last week. As shown in our Trend Analyzersnapshot below, it's the defensives that are finally lagging, with Real Estate (XLRE) down 4% and Utilities (XLU) down 2% since last Thursday's close. At the moment, only Materials and Health Care are overbought, while the rest are neutral.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA2.png))**  *****  # US Falls to the Bottom of the Pack  &gt; In a post earlier this week, we provided an update to the Citi Economic Surprise indices broken out by region. With economic data in the US continuing to disappoint this week, the Citi Surprise index (percentage of economic indicators that are beating vs. missing estimates) for the US is coming increasingly close to taking out its late April low and declining to its lowest levels in two years. What's also notable about the current reading is that at the most recent reading of -67.5, the surprise index for the US is more negative than any other country or region that this series tracks.  &gt; Below we compare the Citi surprise reading for the US and Europe over the last twelve months, and what a reversal it has been. Heading into 2019, economic data in the US was coming in much better relative to expectations versus Europe, but ever since then, data in the US has been getting progressively worse relative to expectations, while data in Europe has been consistently improving.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062719-Surprise.png))**  *****  # July’s First Trading Day—Most Bullish Day, S&amp;P 500 has Advanced 85.7% of the Time  &gt; July’s first trading day is the best performing first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1,175.74 points since 1998. Over the past 21 years, DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.40%. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 85.7% of the time (average gain 0.42%). NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41bfded64b6be009498141e06d860cc6/tumblr_inline_ptt611r7Jm1spdppr_500.jpg))**  *****  # Pre-Election Year July Performance Mixed  &gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019).  &gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and strength towards the end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fd24fdadfeace7c60e914f3ebcfb44c/tumblr_inline_pts3qnHGqq1spdppr_400.jpg))**  &gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #6 for DJIA and #7 S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #8. NASDAQ has only advanced in six of the last twelve pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for June 28th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivC-TiWAzAI))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 06.30.19**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csILGnJHs7A))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading month ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$NFLX**  &gt; * **$BA**  &gt; * **$F**  &gt; * **$UNH**  &gt; * **$INTC**  &gt; * **$T**  &gt; * **$CLF**  &gt; * **$BAC**  &gt; * **$PEP**  &gt; * **$GOOGL**  &gt; * **$AEMD**  &gt; * **$DAL**  &gt; * **$JPM**  &gt; * **$C**  &gt; * **$SMPL**  &gt; * **$HAL**  &gt; * **$WFC**  &gt; * **$IRBT**  &gt; * **$AYI**  &gt; * **$JNJ**  &gt; * **$MMM**  &gt; * **$BBBY**  &gt; * **$YRD**  &gt; * **$NOK**  &gt; * **$ISCA**  &gt; * **$CAT**  &gt; * **$CMG**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$KO**  &gt; * **$MA**  &gt; * **$LEVI**  &gt; * **$BMY**  &gt; * **$SLB**  &gt; * **$INFY**  &gt; * **$OMN**  &gt; * **$GS** &gt; * **$CSX**  &gt; * **$PGR**  &gt; * **$UPS**  &gt; * **$ERIC**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$AA**  &gt; * **$CNC**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFYkaOT.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/R5KvFNE.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/LA02AwI.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 7.1.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/SNywSpDT/er7119am.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 7.1.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/gcyCb0qL/er7119pm.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 7.2.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/tTN2wsQX/er7219am.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 7.2.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 7.3.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/85NbRTFx/er7319am.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 7.3.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 7.4.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.

If you're not familiar with it, it basically asks you if you think the stock is going to go up, down or sideways (It even uses really cool names, like ""Iron Condor"" to make you feel right at home).

So here is my method - Could someone just wait for the next recession, let the market pull back 30-50%, and then trade options using Robinhood's discovery feature (""I think this stock is going to go up"") to bet that companies like Microsoft, Walmart, McDonald's are going to go up within 1-2-3 years?

The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.  [Tesla Completes Acquisition of Maxwell Technologies | May 16 2019](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-completes-acquisition-maxwell-technologies)  As of the expiration of the exchange offer, a total of approximately 36,764,342 shares of common stock of Maxwell were validly tendered in the exchange offer and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 79% of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Maxwell common stock outstanding immediately after the consummation of the exchange offer.

[How Tesla plans to cut customers’ insurance costs: Tap into Autopilot | May 13 2019](https://www.autonews.com/finance-insurance/how-tesla-plans-cut-customers-insurance-costs-tap-autopilot)  Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates. Musk, on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, said the product would ""be much more compelling than anything else out there.""  [Tesla (TSLA) is going to get up to $2 billion from Fiat-Chrysler to meet emission standards | May 7 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/05/07/tesla-tsla-2-billion-fiat-chrysler-emission-standards/)  We recently learned that Tesla and Fiat-Chrysler (FCA) reached a deal to pool their fleet together in Europe for the purpose of the latter avoiding emission requirement fines. It was first reported to be worth a few hundred million dollars, but FCA now says that it will pay Tesla up to $2 billion for the emission credits.  [Tesla (TSLA) closes its massive $2.7 billion capital raise to boost its cash position | May 8 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/05/08/tesla-tsla-closes-capital-raise/)  Tesla announced today that it closed its new capital raise yesterday and it was over-subscribed with underwriters selling the additional shares and notes for total proceeds of $2.7 billion to boost Tesla’s cash position.  [Elon Musk Confirms He Bought $25 Million in Tesla Stock Last Week | May 7 2019](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-tesla-stock-buy-51557202259)  Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed in a regulatory filing late Monday that he purchased $25 million of his company’s stock in a public offering last week. He bought the shares on Thursday, May 2. A form that Musk filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that he now owns 33,927,560 Tesla shares through the trust.  [More Advanced Safety for Tesla Owners | May 2, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/more-advanced-safety-tesla-owners)  The massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars’ eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash. As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.  [Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)  The chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.  [Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)  During its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.  [The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)  Beginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle’s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We’re also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.  [Elon Musk said Tesla cars will probably be better than humans at driving by the end of 2019 | Apr 17 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-predicts-tesla-cars-better-than-humans-at-driving-by-end-of-2019-2019-4?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral)  Tesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. ""I think it will become very quickly — maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I'd be shocked if it's not next year, at the latest — that having a human intervene will decrease safety,"" Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla's autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry.  [Introducing a More Seamless Navigate on Autopilot | April 3, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-more-seamless-navigate-autopilot?utm_campaign=NoA&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social)  Since we first introduced Navigate on Autopilot last year, Tesla drivers have traveled more than 66 million miles using the feature, and more than 9 million suggested lane changes have been successfully executed with the feature in use. Today, we’re beginning to roll out our latest version of Navigate on Autopilot for a more seamless active guidance experience. In this new version, drivers will now have the option to use Navigate on Autopilot without having to confirm lane changes via the turn stalk.  [Musk Hints Tesla Pickup Truck Will Make Ram Seem ""Puny"" | Mar 31, 2019](https://insideevs.com/news/343601/musk-hints-tesla-pickup-truck-will-make-ram-seem-puny/)  Of course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here's the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?It's not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it's scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with ""crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,"" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.  [Musk Says Tesla \`Would Love to Be' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)  Elon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!” Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer said in a Twitter post, nearly ten months after he blamed restrictive policy for delaying the carmaker’s entry into the world’s fourth largest automobile market.  [Tesla Model Y announced: release set for 2020, price starts at $47,000 | Mar 14 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264446/tesla-model-y-suv-compact-announcement-price-release-date-features-elon-musk)  The specs weren’t much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.  [Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)  Tesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.  [Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)  The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.  [Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)  According to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.  # [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)  **Elon Musk - CEO**  Elon oversees the company's product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers. Elon has been fascinated by electric cars for two decades. After earning bachelor's degrees in physics and business from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked briefly on ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research in Silicon Valley to understand their potential as an energy storage mechanism for EVs. He planned to do graduate studies at Stanford in materials science and applied physics but put school on hold to start Internet companies Zip2 and PayPal. In addition to his Tesla duties, he leads SpaceX,where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth orbit.  **JB Straubel - CTO**  At Tesla, JB focuses on technical direction and engineering design including battery technology, power electronics, motors, software, firmware and controls. In addition to his work at Tesla, JB is also a lecturer at his alma mater, Stanford University, where he created and teaches an engineering class and lab focused on energy storage integration (CEE 176C) in the Engineering Department. JB has had a lifelong interest in electric vehicles, including rebuilding an electric gold cart at the age of 14, building an Electric Porsche 944 that held a world EV racing record, solar car racing and building a hybrid trailer system that he designed while in college. In 2008 the MIT Technology Review chose JB as “#1 Innovator of 35 under 35 for the year”. In 2009 DesignNews named him “Engineer of the Year”. And in 2015 he was listed as #2 on Fortune’s 40 under 40 most influential business and innovation leaders.

So here it is.  &amp;#x200B;  I may do these every Sunday, or this may be the first and last.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't fuck with options like some of you retards, just stocks for now. I'm also not autistic enough to day trade. I have a real job and social obligations (in case you're wondering, cry-shouting at your mum because she hasn't cleaned your CPAP machine doesn't count as socialising). So I stick to stocks and typically pick some on Sunday then close positions throughout the following week or the one after.  &amp;#x200B;  I usually focus on companies with market caps between 100M and 1 Bn, because they're more interesting and often volatile. I'm also bored of the same old $AAPL, $SNAP, $LYFT, $BABA, $MSFT ad nauseum circle-jerk. I like penny stocks if they poke their heads into dollar territory and I can see a good opportunity to brown bear dick them back down into oblivion. bear gang for life.  &amp;#x200B;  So, without further ado - here are my top 3 picks for the coming week, complete with big swinging DDs:  &amp;#x200B;  **$WKHS (BEAR - short term)**  &amp;#x200B;  I posted about this [earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmcyww/wkhs_penny_stock_up_200_today_because_of_a_trump/) and was completely ignored. Really hurt my feelings you guys, but because I love you i'm going to give you all a second run at the tendies. TL;DR is that this week Trump tweeted about Workhorse buying a vacant plant from $GM in Ohio, which pushed their stock price out of the pennies and over $2 in a few hours, based on absolutely nothing. From what I can see, Workhorse are a failing electric truck manufacturer trying to dig themselves out of a money hole by borrowing even more money and spending it stupidly. Trump made a big deal about the sale because it's Ohio and he wants to take credit for every job created there. Turns out the United Auto Workers (UAW) don't want the deal to go through and GM are contractually prohibited from closing or selling the plant until its current labour deal with the UAW expires in September. Plus Workhorse might not even have the money to buy the plant. All in all, a bunch of all caps hot air from Teflon Don. BUT... you didn't miss out on all the tendies. At $1.82 $WKHS is still an overweight date and dying for a dicking back into the pennies. I'm expecting a sharp sell off on Monday and will hopefully be closing by Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on how big a train the markets run on her.  &amp;#x200B;  1 caveat:  &amp;#x200B;  Workhorse are currently through to the final stage of a USPS competition to replace their old fleet of postal delivery vehicles. The winner should be announced very soon (maybe as soon as this week, since it's been delayed since 2018). If Workhorse win the contract, it'll be worth $6 Bn+ and absolutely rape my position. Competition is stiff, but I'm discounting everyone except for AM General and Workhorse. AM General are my favourites because they have the relationship with the federal government and the capacity / expertise to get the job done. Except for Workhorse and Oshkosh/Ford, all other competitors are foreign (Indian and Turkish). No way Teflon Don is giving this business to ~~ragheads~~ a non-US company this close to an election (MAGA). I'm discounting Ford because their design looks like dog shit and the proposed plant isn't in a swing state. As I said above, Workhorse are in Ohio. AM General are in Southbend, Indiana, another swing state. So, to my mind, Trump's **rational** play is to push USPS to give the deal to AM General and please Indiana state voters. Come September, he can still push GM to sell to Workhorse in Ohio to try and pick up votes there but by then i'll be on a boat in the Caribbean doing ketamine off midgets' painted feet so it's no skin of my perfectly smooth sack.  &amp;#x200B;  **$VCEL (BULL - mid-term)**  &amp;#x200B;  Vericel are a biopharm company specialising in therapies that aid tissue and organ repair. It's actually some pretty cool steam-punk tech that wouldn't be out of place in an Alien film or Demolition Man. Cell therapy to repair joints, biological skin graft and meshes to regrow organic tissue...it's cool. Most recently, this month they signed an exclusive deal with MediWound ($MDWD) to license and sell a burn gel (NexoBrid) in North America. The gel uses enzymes to remove burned tissue - in a phase II clinical trial, 93% of subjects experiencing complete removal of the damaged tissue. Great stuff. The deal with MediWound is performanced-based, so if the gel doesn't sell, VCEL won't be crippled by payments. Here's the really good bit: in Europe, you can't use this gel outside of specialist burn centres because it's too advanced for peasant use, but you yanks have a pretty lackadaisical approach to healthcare, which is why you're all hooked on pain pills and antidepressants. Anything that's restricted in Europe will sell like fucking cronuts state-side. Plus 75% of burn patients are treated at specialist centres in the US vs about a third in Europe. The icing on the cake is that VCEL dropped 8% after their Q1 earnings so i'm picking shares up at a discount. Will be seeing how things develop over the next few weeks / month either buying dips or closing if/when i'm up 15-20%. Bear in mind **FDA approval likely isn't until the end of 2020** \- if I had the patience I'd hold these guys for the long term but I know i'll just get bored. I'm looking to ride the recent positive sentiment up and then dump in a month or less.  &amp;#x200B;  **$VFF (BEAR - mid-term)**  &amp;#x200B;  Village Farms have had a good run recently. Nominally a fruit and veg grower, in 2017 they formed a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics, called Pure Sunfarms, to grow cannabis, . Pure Sunfarms is profitable and all looks hunky dory for now BUT:  &amp;#x200B;  1) Village Farms are one of the most inefficient cannabis growers out there, with crop yields of less than 100 grams per square foot. Average is 100 grams or more, but compare this to Flowr Corp which use genetics to boost yields to about 300 grams per square foot. It means Village Farms are likely to have higher production costs and lower margins.  &amp;#x200B;  2) Pure Sunfarms have yet to secure buyers for most of their product. Couple this with general market oversupply of weed and you have a recipe for crushed prices and dreams.  &amp;#x200B;  3) Village Farms stock price has jumped recently which means at best a correction and at worst a dump as investors realise there are much better growers out there.   &amp;#x200B;  The way the cannabis industry is going at the moment, we should expect a contraction as the mom and pop and have-a-go growers get squeezed out by WEED CORP. I think Village Farms had a great idea to diversify into a profitable product using their existing infrastructure, but growing weed isn't like growing tomatoes. They either take it seriously and upgrade their farms and up their yield, or they fade away and go back to aubergines full time.  &amp;#x200B;  Either way, I'm bearish in the short to mid term - hoping to close positions by the end of May, but may hang on a bit longer if weed prices take the downturn I'm expecting.  &amp;#x200B;  And that's it for this week.

I invest based on feels and instinct and I have a good feeling about Ford for a few reasons:  1. They decided to stop making shitbox econocars and sedans that don't sell and are focusing on their trucks, SUV's, and the Stang - all things that sell. These are also categories that foreign manufacturers are not strong in = less competition.  2. Ford seems to be developing a hybrid gas-electric F150. I think this could be yuge.  3. Ford has had huge success with it's Ecoboost engines, especially in their trucks. Competitors like Dodge and Chevy are not their yet with their V6/turbo offerings for light duty trucks.  4. Stock has been stagnant for a long time and I think any positive news will send it to the moon. I'm hoping that optimism around the focus on profitable categories sends it to the moon.  5. Some analyst rating summary on Robinhood tells me that the CEO is into cutting bureaucracy and I'm down with that.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|552004|public|confidence|self|Anyone Bullish on Ford?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm0l4t/anyone_bullish_on_ford/|no_ads|0.0||dark|||||||||||1557627014.0|||2019-05-08|FORD

Presently: They posted declining YoY April sales as part of a declining Q1 and they completed the sale of their parts supplier Magneti Marelli for $6.5B, which was supposed to sell for $7B.  Looking forward, they can't meet EU efficiency standards so they're paying Tesla an undisclosed (billion+) amount to pool their numbers, otherwise they can't sell in Europe.  Recently: They lost their visionary leader and revised their guidance down. The stock plunged and is still within a dollar of it's 52 week low.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other hand, FCA is at book value (last quarter book was $15.01 and they were at $15.05 earlier today) with decent free cash flow and a PE of 5.5 versus Honda 7.6, Toyota 10.4, and Ford 13.2.  They have growth potential: Jeep is a popular brand, they're decently positioned in the lucrative pickup truck market, and they have an ambitious electrification plan.  &amp;#x200B;  Personally, I picked up shares and 9/20 15c on today's dip. I don't know if they'll go back to $22 but I'm pretty sure they're worth more than their $15 book value.

Thought that seemed odd given the positive earnings and company direction, and seemed like a good opportunity to get some call options at a discounted price.   $10 strike 6/21 expiration calls were going for $0.20, and I had a limit buy order to snatch a few of those. Unfortunately didn’t get it submitted until a couple minutes after market closed, so the trades didn’t go through (fuck me right?).  Figured no big deal, I’ll get them first thing when market opens today as my order is already placed.   It never got filled. Those call options immediately jumped up by the time the market opened, have steadily climbed over the past couple hours as the stock price has gone up, and they’re now going for $0.63.  A little bummed on missing out on quick tendies, portfolio (RIP) really could’ve used a win after this week. Any advice on how I could’ve approached this differently? Maybe anticipating the upward movement and setting a higher limit buy so it would’ve been filled when the market opened?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|544754|public|confidence|self|Better timing on options?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bho1fg/better_timing_on_options/|no_ads|0.0|||||||||||||1556381173.0|||2019-04-26|FORD

Recent tests on driver shows signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. High levels of toxicity which is not good, it can actually be deadly. **THIS IS NOT NEW, THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING OM FOR 2 YEARS** Now there are new pushes most recently by Bloomberg. So first of all some recent news story on the issue:   https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-ford-explorer-owners-say-suvs-making-them-sick/  Here’s an old link from 2017. Many cop patrols use Ford Explorer and its not so good when a cop is being exposed to carbon monoxide. Several officers were hospitalized.   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ford-rushes-repair-police-suvs-more-departments-raise-carbon-monoxide-n791031  Unlike in a home basement leak of carbon monoxide, this is not *as* bad since you don’t sleep and live in your car. It’s still pretty bad because the long commutes can add up fast. Carbon monoxide is hard to detect without proper instrumentation. A person can not simply tell they are in the presence of it since it’s an odorless gas. There are debates on whether accidents have been directly caused in these SUV’s due to carbon monoxide poisoning however it’s very possible they were. CO can cause anything from dizziness to loss of consciousness to permanent brain damage depending on exposure. I’m not saying the issue on hand is that big but we don’t know. See below for more info on CO poisoning and symptoms.   https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642  Why Short Ford? This news will now start to develop more and more as the owners push for answers. Many owners are not going to want to drive their cars. Though the investigation is and has been underway it looks to be a boiling shitstorm. Ford will likely have to eventually admit to their fault which at the moment there is just an *alleged* monoxide leak because they even tried to fix the issue before but have failed to do so properly. If and when Ford makes the announcement. They will have to recall millions of explorers but that’s not the end of the world. Recalls happen. If the issue is just the whole near the lift gate that’s allowing CO then it’s a simply plug/patch up and you’re done, not s big deal. The worse will be the lawsuits that come along this type of a deal. There’s attorneys probably drafting up cases right now to get a class action suit going against Ford.   Old individual lawsuit regarding same issue: https://jalopnik.com/police-officer-suffered-nerve-damage-after-carbon-monox-1819668340  Is Ford going to **TANK** on Monday? Likely not. Is this going to be their demise? Likely not. But it’s definitely a big issue that’s been brewing up too long now and somethings gotta blow with everything re-surfacing.   TLDR: Ford SUVs had and still show signs of carbon monoxide leaks causing adverse health effects for drivers. Buy puts accordingly if you want. Buy calls to inverse wsb. Godspeed fellow autists. |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|522372|public|confidence|self|Potentiometer Short play: Ford.

Both also stated that it's too early come to any conclusions. Oddly enough though, they've been working closely together to patch the MCAS software for months. This is the software many believe led to the Lion Air crash last year.  I've seen the arguments from the bulls here about the smoke and sputtering noises before the crash, leading some to believe that this is an isolated incident. The eerie similarity is in how the Ethiopian flight just decided to nose dive directly into the ground after [experiencing unstable vertical speed after takeoff](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1104671024581357568).  It's not crazy to think some kind of mechanical failure happened, the pilots attempted to compensate, and this piece of software decided it knew best and sent the jet crashing towards earth.  You'd have to be both retarded and blind not to recognize that both of these organizations understood the dangers of these jets, and continued to let them fly. 2 out of the (350) 737 MAX 8's in commercial use have violently nose dived mere minutes after take off. Killing every passenger and crew member in both instances. ROUGHLY .6% OF THESE FUCKING DEATH TRAPS HAVE EXPLODED WITH LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF USE UNDER THEIR BELT. That is insane.  &amp;#x200B;  So what's my point here? *Culpability.*  Both the FAA and $BA have stated that these planes are just fine, yet they're actively working to solve the safety issues. They've got nearly 400 fatalities on their hand at this point, have essentially admitted guilt with their condolences and software development, yet rather than admitting they fucked up the first time around, they're doubling down.  To make matters worse, take a look at the [insider trading records from the last few months](https://i.imgur.com/7OXK6B6.png). I suppose an argument could be made that these execs were just cashing in on historically high prices. What's really fucking odd though is the EVP and General Counsel to $BA gifted half of his shares to an undisclosed party, and the other half of his shares to his wife, who then transferred to a trust on October 29th 2018. Yes, that's the [date of the first 737 MAX 8 crash](https://i.imgur.com/yNaTwXK.png). What a coincidence. Then, a few weeks after the black box was dug out of the ocean, [he and his wife sell 8,500 shares, or 69% of their disclosed shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000122520819002329/xslF345X03/doc4.xml), on the open market. [It's worth noting that officials claimed it could take a few weeks to recover the data.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash/no-public-details-on-crashed-lion-air-voice-recorder-until-final-report-indonesian-official-idUSKCN1PG08R)  This is just one example. Go look up the other execs. Equally suspect shit going on with quite a few of the officers.  &amp;#x200B;  Who cares though, right? You should if you hold a bullish position on this stock. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, head of the House Transportation Committee, stated that  [""heads will roll at the FAA if they're not confident in their data and the safety of this plane""](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feinstein-blumenthal-lead-dem-pressure-on-boeing-after-deadly-ethiopian-airlines-crash).    If that happens, let's be real here, heads are gonna to roll at GM as well. Once the investigations start, shit is gonna hit the fan. Remember what happened to Ford with the whole [exploding pinto scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Legal_cases)? Around 1979  the corporation was *charged with murder,* paid a disclosed $128M ($450M today), and who knows how much they settled for out of court. Oh, and more importantly for you bulls, their [stock price plummeted by 66%](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/stock-price-history) and didn't recover for 3 years.  &amp;#x200B;  # SHORT $BA  &amp;#x200B;  *Disclaimer: This isn't actual investment advice. I seriously don't know wtf I'm doing. I'm just bearish on this stock and looking for ways to confirm my bias.* "|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|515274|public|confidence|self|$BA issues 737 MAX software enhancement press release - offers condolences to families of both crashes.

The American Elite made a huge gamble on education and it didn't pay off. They deliberately dumbed down the American population. They wrongfully assumed companies like GM, Exxon Mobil, Ford would be the largest companies in the world *forever.* ""I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers"" - Rockefeller. That hubris cost America dearly. They trained the population to be good factory workers. Rote labor is all but automated these days. No one is working at a factory anymore but the population is still trained to work in a factory. The demand is for creative, innovative, and smart people. American's weren't trained to be creative, innovative or smart. There is a lack of talent as noted by every Silicon Valley CEO in their interviews about hiring. Watch those interviews they all say the same thing the demand is not being met within America and they need to look global. This works in their favor since these developing regions have cheap labor but it's more than that. It's not a coincidence most of the Tech CEO's are Indian, Chinese, or from South East Asia. Those regions didn't develop until the last 30 years or so they skipped the factory floor element of the workplace. The demand is for programmers, mathematicians, innovative thinkers and they trained their population accordingly. There are more people living in China with genius level IQ's than there are people living the US. US education hasn't caught up to workplace demand and they are falling behind in tech to developing countries.

Happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty good last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 21st, 2019.  # **Stocks getting a bit frothy after move higher, could pause as more earnings roll out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/stocks-getting-a-bit-frothy-after-move-higher-could-pause-in-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks have gotten a boost from optimismfor U.S.-China trade talks, but earnings could take a bigger role in the week ahead, when reports roll in from a diverse group of companies in tech, railroads, pharma, airlines and consumer products. ***** &gt; Stocks closed higher for a fourth week, amid talk the market may be getting overbought. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.9 percent for the week, to 2,670, giving it a gain of 13.6 percent from the Dec. 24 closing low. Going into the week, strategists were wondering if the S&amp;P could even hold above the 2,600 level, a key area of resistance, but it punched through the level, ending the week above the band of resistance. ***** &gt; ""I think the market had made even the pros frustrated. At this point, if you haven't bought the market this year, it's not the most prudent thing to do to chase it today. At the same time, being short is frustrating,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. ***** &gt; Redler said he's still long the market, but is hedging because the quick gains have made it riskier. ""The next stop traders are looking at is 2,700 to 2,730 ... next week could be a good week for a pause while [the market] digests the move."" Redler said next week's reports will be important, but the following week will be key with Apple and Amazon. ***** &gt; Headlines on trade were a positive this past week, including one that the U.S. was considering rolling back tariffs and another that China was offering to ramp up U.S. imports. ***** &gt; ""We are going to continue to see these headlines until the deadline,"" said Cesar Rojas, Citigroup global economist. Rojas said he expects to see a deal between the U.S. and China by the March 1 deadline, and while all the details may not be ironed out, he does not expect to see more tariffs. ***** &gt; ""The focus for China is to stabilize its economy. One of the reasons we see a window of opportunity for a trade deal is the growth dynamics for the U.S. and China. We see still growth in the U.S., weakening growth in China for the first half, but for the second half, we see stabilizing growth in China and moderating growth in the U.S.,"" he said. He said the next senior-level talks at the end of the month could be key. ***** &gt; ""I think you want to watch trade. We have a client survey we do once a quarter, and more than half the investors thought we would not get a trade deal by March 1,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equities strategy at RBC Capital Markets. ""I think that's part of the reason the market's been acting better in here. It's not that anything has happened, but you have some nice news, news that's moving in a positive direction."" ***** &gt; Economic reports in the week ahead will be limited due to the government shutdown, which in itself is a growing risk for markets as economists say it could shave a tenth of a percentage point off GDP growth for each week it continues. Regularly scheduled durable goods will not be available, but there will be existing home sales Tuesday and jobless claims on Thursday, among others. ***** &gt; For the stock market, earnings will be important, with nearly 60 S&amp;P companies reporting. That includes IBM and Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday; Procter and Gamble and United Technologies Wednesday, and Intel and Starbucks Thursday. ***** &gt; Financial companies were a mixed bag in the past week, with some high-profile misses such as Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, with its first miss in 15 quarters. ***** &gt; Earnings growth at this point is expected to be up 14.2 percent, when considering companies that have already reported, according to Refinitiv. ***** &gt; ""You have to be a little careful at this point. It's very lumpy when you're coming out of the gate sector-by-sector,"" said Calvasina. ""I think the industrials are going to be an important sector. I'm curious to see what's going to happen to them. The margin expectations have been pretty high, and a lot of the sell-side expectations are baking in expansion."" Calvasina said the sector was one of the most vocal last quarter about the impact of tariffs and could have updates on the impact. ***** &gt; For tech, earnings expectations have been coming down and are now at 2.6 percent growth for the sector in 2019. The lowered expectations for technology companies have trailed the declines in other sectors, such as materials, consumer discretionary and health care, Calvasina said. Overall, the S&amp;P is expected to see earnings growth of 6 percent in 2019, down from more than 23 percent in 2018. ***** &gt; Even with lowered earnings expectations, technology stocks are not really reflecting the earnings cuts as much as some other sectors. Semiconductors has been a culprit, pulling down the whole group. On a price-to-earnings basis, relative to the market, technology P/Es have been creeping higher, not falling, she said. ***** &gt; ""The damage to earnings is worse than the damage to the price,"" she said, meaning that the stocks could be vulnerable this earnings season. ***** &gt; The World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland, on Sunday. President Donald Trump and Cabinet members are not attending because of the government shutdown.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wCm025H.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hb1FeIH.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HKEsZHI.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3E4tKmo.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/I2mgrW6.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WM5JbyP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v3rxrY.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WTWMIZ4.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cXBwa1I.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mQtZZln.png))** (PENDING THE STATUS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN!)  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eOcSkrU.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Z2M4v2O.png))**  *****  # The Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks So Far in 2019  &gt; Below we take a look at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since we turned the corner into the new year. The top stock in the S&amp;P 500 so far YTD is the healthcare play Celgene (CELG). At today’s close, the company finished up an astounding 37.67% year to date. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Netflix (NFLX) are not far behind up 35.44% and 32.5%, respectively.  &gt; While Health Care and Communication Services stocks make up the top three, the Energy sector is actually the most represented on the list with 11 out of 30 names. Whereas Tech was the poster child for gains for most of last year, there is only a single Technology stock in the top 30, and it’s probably the last one you’d guess — Xerox (XRX).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/best1.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at the other end of the spectrum, with bankruptcy talks dominating the focus of the stock, PG&amp;E (PCG) has fallen 70.91% in just 15 days. Macy’s ranks 2nd with a decline of 16.12%, while Newmont Mining (NEM) ranks 3rd at -10.48%. These are the only three stocks in the index down more than 10% on the year.  &gt; The worst performers have a much larger variation on a sector basis. Health Care, which was another outperformer of 2018, is the only standout with 8 companies represented in the worst 30. The only sectors without a stock making this list are Real Estate, Communication Services, and Energy.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/worst1.png))**  *****  # Typical Pre-Election Year January Trading: Up, Up &amp; Away  &gt; In pre-election years, Januarys have been downright stellar ranking #1 for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA since 1950. Thus far, this January has been adhering to this historical tendency rather well. As of yesterday’s close, Russell 2000 was leading the charge, up nearly 7.2%. NASDAQ was in second place with a gain of 5.9% while DJIA was at the back of the pack at 3.2%.  &gt; Looking at the chart below, comparing past historical average pre-election year January performance with 2019 as of the close on the eleventh trading day (January 15), you can see all five indexes are have produced above average gains throughout most of the month already. You can also see that, on average, the trend from now until the end of the month has been quite positive which suggests further gains are possible.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/92619ab897507e8ab5c467b819c2131f/tumblr_inline_plfy0uAvsu1spdppr_500.jpg))**  *****  # High Yield Spreads: When Crashing is a Good Thing  &gt; After screaming higher towards the end of 2018 right up through the first couple of days of 2019, high yield spreads have come crashing back down to earth in the last two weeks, falling from a high of 544 basis points (bps) on 1/3 to 440 bps through Thursday. At their highs two weeks ago, spreads were the widest they have been since the Summer of 2016 and the highest while moving higher since the middle of 2015 when oil prices were crashing.  &gt; In the lower chart, we show the 10-day rate of change of high yield spreads over time. At their peak back on 1/3, spreads had seen the largest 10-day move wider since early 2018 (98 bps). Ten trading days later, we are now looking at the largest narrowing move in spreads since July 2016. Unlike the current period, the narrowing of spreads in July 2016 did not immediately follow a 10-day move where spreads widened significantly. To find a period where this large of a move immediately followed a ten-day period where investors couldn’t exit high yield fast enough (wider spreads), you have to go back to that period in February 2016 that was marked by the ‘Dimon Bottom.” Now, if only the market follows a similar path moving forward!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/011819-High-Yield.png))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for January 18th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET UP!)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.20.19**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET UP!)  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$JNJ**  &gt; * **$IBM**  &gt; * **$HAL**  &gt; * **$INTC**  &gt; * **$F**  &gt; * **$AAL**  &gt; * **$PG**  &gt; * **$STLD**  &gt; * **$ATI**  &gt; * **$SWK**  &gt; * **$SBUX**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$TRV**  &gt; * **$PGR**  &gt; * **$PLD**  &gt; * **$UTX**  &gt; * **$FITB**  &gt; * **$LUV**  &gt; * **$BMY**  &gt; * **$CMCSA**  &gt; * **$UBSH** &gt; * **$ABBV**  &gt; * **$LRCX**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$KMB**  &gt; * **$MBWM**  &gt; * **$URI**  &gt; * **$EDU**  &gt; * **$AMTD**  &gt; * **$JBLU**  &gt; * **$FCX**  &gt; * **$WDC**  &gt; * **$GATX**  &gt; * **$FBC**  &gt; * **$ONB**  &gt; * **$PEBO**  &gt; * **$XLNX**  &gt; * **$FNB**  &gt; * **$OFG**  &gt; * **$UBS**  &gt; * **$MKC**  &gt; * **$ASML**  &gt; * **$UNP**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cXBwa1I.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0l0sQbd.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 1.21.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.

I currently have 25k in my account so I'm good to go. I have another 8k I am depositing tomorrow to start day trading. I want to play it safe to begin with because I don't have a financial background. I'm college educated but my degree is marketing. Econ &amp; accounting were never my strengths. Anyway, I was looking at the most commonly day traded stocks. Here is what I was understanding...  First off, it's best to buy in the evening (prices usually drop), and sell in the morning. I could make a minimum of around $281 dollars a day simply by day trading Ford (or another very similar volatile stock). It's a safe and volatile stock. For example:   I buy $8000 worth of Ford in the evening at $8.52. That's about 938 shares. In the morning, I check if the price has increased by at least 30 cents (Ford seems to do this in the morning). Once I see that, I sell Ford, and make around $281. If Ford isn't increasing in the morning, I will just set a sell limit for 30 cents or more so I can go about my day.  To me, this seems like the safe way to get a daily profit from stock trading. I could build more money over the course of time with this, so I'll keep having more money to invest.   Another method which I'm interested in but a little cautious about doing, is looking at the daily losers. Find a top daily loser. Make sure that stock has over 1 million in volume. Research the daily loser to make sure nothing majorly bad happened to the company and check it's history. Then sell the daily loser once it goes up again.  I'm just looking for any thoughts/feedback on my ideas. I'm new to stocks so I would definitely appreciate it. |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|438590|public|confidence|self|I think I could make a living day trading Ford.

Since I don’t have any debts or other financial burdens, I started to use some money to trade options on Robinhood. I didn’t take any loans or anything but I started trading options with 5 grand that I was able to save over a couple of months.  I’ve been doing this for over 2 months now and one thing I was always cautious about was that I should only buy Calls or puts but never sell them as I can lose more than what I’m playing with if I sell options. So as of this morning my portfolio value was around $4700, buying power was 2k and I had 50 contracts of Ford $8.5 puts expiring today which were worth $50. I placed an order to sell them which never got executed and got cancelled around 2 pm ET. I just opened RH out of curiosity and my portfolio value is a little over $8k and my margin value is -75k and I have 5000 shares of Ford. How the fuck were my puts executed if they were otm? Did I somehow fuck up when I tried to sell those puts this morning or is this a technical glitch? I’m going to be fucked for at least an year and a half if that’s coming out of my pocket.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|416300|public|confidence|self|Did I just lose 75 grand or is this a technical glitch?||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9zvst4/did_i_just_lose_75_grand_or_is_this_a_technical/|house_only|1.0||||||||||||||||2018-11-24|FORD
