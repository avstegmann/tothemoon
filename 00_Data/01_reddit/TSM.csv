However, this is not true, because there are a lot companies with far more shares outstanding and their price is ten times (or much more) higher than NOK. Here are some of them:  [BAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/key-statistics?p=BAC), [PFE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/key-statistics?p=PFE), [T](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T/key-statistics?p=T), [TSM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM/key-statistics?p=TSM), [AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL), [MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/key-statistics?p=MSFT) etc.  The market works very simply - when the crowd buys, prices go up and vice versa. The good thing about NOК is that it is cheap. As you can see below, exactly a year ago this forum had 1.1 million degenerates. Today we are 9.7 million. I turn to those 8.6 of the newcomers. Еach of us knows what he is here for. Well, it's just 4.63B / 8.6M = 538 shares on average and we buy all the free float. It is not even necessary to buy the whole float to raise the price tenfold, but much much less as the companies shown above. I know some of you don't have so much money, but others have more. AVERAGE. Completely achievable. And your dreams come true.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hn68z92hv0q61.png?width=1921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2322c511e80884cea3155ed4d0987a7067ecc995|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9687952.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/eCAeR9FzEZP7RNHJ4bF_D0YrBBBSaarGTLRlMze4K0Q.jpg|65.0|140.0|NOK can do it?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfy4pn/nok_can_do_it/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2021-03-29|TSM

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.  Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.  Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below  3 main reasons why I like this stock:  * Overall semiconductor market future * Finances and balance sheet * Cathie Wood investment  2 possible downsides:  * Low future earnings forecasts * Recent price volatility  ### Future  Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:  * The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold. * The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers. * Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc. * Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology * Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology * Automated manufacturing  Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:  * [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states) * [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx) * [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/) * [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)  All of this will require automation and testing.  Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:  * 5G technology being rolled out worldwide * Space technology &amp; tourism growth * AI &amp; data technology  The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.  Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.  ### Finances  Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.  They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.  &amp;#x200B;  [5 Year Net Income for Teradyne, rising from -$43m in 2016 to $784m in 2020. Return on Equity was 42.49&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/h23vdc1aaln61.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be5437b649cbc2b03a13cadadd0ca0eee90ef6b)  Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*  When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.  From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.  ### Cathie Wood Investment  Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.  Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.  ### Possible Downsides  Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.  Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.  &amp;#x200B;  [Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](https://preview.redd.it/e5rxrx48aln61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d012a19c15c1664614c9c953adcee881b4020f)  ### Summary  Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9579681.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XHsWxw_SXd-La2iUVT6jq902K0jLzaqo6IfL4NtnRoI.jpg|55.0|140.0|Teradyne Inc DD, a stock with increasing online chatter|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m709l5/teradyne_inc_dd_a_stock_with_increasing_online/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2021-03-17|TSM

UMC has reaped the rewards of a booming market for mobile phones, connected devices and online education – and the results showed up in the company's third-quarter earnings. Revenue rose 18.9%, while gross profit grew nearly 52%, as strong demand for UMC's 28-nanometer chips pushed profits higher. Shares are up an eye-watering 240% in the last year, but compared to larger competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), UMC still looks cheap.

There has been some movement by world leaders to improve supply chains in order to get the semiconductors to the place they need to be. Some car manufacturers have had to cut production in vehicles due to this ongoing issue. I believe this issue will be fixed in due time, but probably not in the immediate future.   **What is SOXL?**  **SOXL** is a Leveraged ETF that invests in the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world (INTC, AMD, QCOM, TSM, etc).   Be careful, this is a ""Leveraged"" ETF - and therefore it's rather aggressive and aiming for high returns. Do some more research here if you want. Essentially it means, if the sector of semiconductors does well, the fund will do well.   **Breakdown:**  Now, they recently had a 15:1 split on their shares, which were trading at about $636 in February. This brought the public float to **99.40M.**  When looking into a company, I like to start with what they own, followed by who owns them.  **What they own:**  Here is a breakdown of the assets that SOXL owns with their 1.46bn market cap:  Dreyfus Government Cash Management Institutional Shs	11.00%  Financial Square Treasury Instruments Fund FST Shares	9.39%  Broadcom Inc.	5.22%  Qualcomm Inc.	4.96%  Intel Corp.	4.94%  Texas Instruments Inc.	4.88%  NVIDIA 	4.67%  Micron Technology Inc.	2.81%  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

It could be nothing more than some type of government investment in such a company, as it is critical right now.   **Who owns them?:**  Looks like mostly hedge funds. No one really of note other than Citadel and Susquehanna.   **Short Interest:**  Not a heavily shorted stock. About 3.4m shares are available to short with a ratio of about 25%.  **Technicals** (got me excited):  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/a7ndly6se1m61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698eae9b1d4ff4726eac546d2a6a8f4bb753fbc6  Here we have a bounce just under the (white) 200sma. On this 4h chart, the bottom represents the buy/sell volume over time. the middle represents where we're at in terms of a squeeze. You also can see heavy buy volume at the bottom followed by a potential turn up ahead in the next few days. TONS of buy volume since the beginning of the month.   The daily was also looking nice:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/id2j5879f1m61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cbb6a2b7af021cadc9d35a9d2f8413c636cb90  There is an AIM on the indicator, meaning at this point the next logical step might be a shot to the upside in the next week. There was heavy call and put volume on the $37 strike, which seemed quite coincidental. Why that level? There were more calls than puts. The OI is still over 10k on the option.   My target is $42 by 3/19. But I encourage you to do your own analysis and come up with your own targets. I happen to think this is a good potential trade. I think in this case, the probability in my belief is to the upside."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9475113.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bZDDXFcQJPKFyCyaINBfmXJEY6ZdoFjGRgveV4WaBkk.jpg|99.0|140.0|SOXL will rock your SOXL|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1bokv/soxl_will_rock_your_soxl/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2021-03-09|TSM

Great financials. The company has a market cap of 5B with revenues of $5B. &lt;---- WHAT??  Positions - (This amounts to 50% of my portfolio)  1. 3/19 - 5x 23C 2. 3/19 - 24x 27C 3. 3/19- 30x 26C  AMKR provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. It provides essential services to companies that deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and works with big names such as NVIDA, Sony, Tesla  ***1.*** ***Financials are great***  5B of revenue, 5B Cap, criminally low P/E of 17.7  Okay, but what about other companies in semi-cons. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17.  AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79. This alone tells you how  undervalued this company is. Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30  The company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income and it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends too.  Low volume  Great financials  ***2.*** ***Company is in a hot, growing space.***  Semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board.Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon..  ***3. Outlook is great:***  last earnings call says that everything is going great and growing HUGE -  “Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.  2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”  Financial highlights:  [https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)  To summarize:  1. Great outlook 2. Best ever quarter and will even pay dividends 3. Great revenue and P/E 4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today 5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space 6.

Intel is having a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced.   Last week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis).   Today I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **🚀**   &amp;#x200B;  INTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **🚀**   &amp;#x200B;  Last price for this option contract was at .36$ \* (100) = 36$ per option contract  As of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find ""beating"" this option contract a more than 50% probability.   To illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts.   For every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price.   Reiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.  Now I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space.   Fan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **🚀**   &amp;#x200B;  Sparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math).   Micron: 3.08% upward move contracts &lt; 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.  TSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.  I wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal.   &amp;#x200B;  Now before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**   &amp;#x200B;  This week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%.   Given the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the ""real"" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite.   Similar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks).   The Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market.   I am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win.   I have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term.   For the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them.   This is deep fucking value.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9167512.0|public|confidence|self|||INTC: The best move for next week.

Unlike AMD or INTC or CRSR - $ON produces components for automotive, personal, medical, cloud, and aerospace and defense.  All of these are important - but the last bit is an important focus.  Because again - Biden is scared of China, and wants to move to become more independent of their chip makers.  ""The White House plans to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and supply chains that are dominated by or run through “nations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable.""  China's biggest semi conductor company TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.) currently sits with a market cap of $588.98B. $ON is at $16.70B.  TSMC's hegemony over the semiconductor market is hardly surprising, considering that it makes silicon for industry bigwigs such as Apple, Nvidia, and AMD and soon to be INTEL as well.  Well - that was the case - until biden steps in and starts giving incentives to use US semi's and gives companies like $ON $$$$ to expand production capabilities.   Thats a lot of potential clients and revenue.  LONG - this company will do very well.  SHORT TERM - it will see steady growth.  Although - I believe this company will explode as soon as any real steps are taken under biden's initiative.

I also believe  the relationship between Taiwan and China have put Taiwan into a  position where it semi depends on the US. With China's economy booming,  the US did not want to give up their baby TSM. They banned TSM, from  making HiSilicon chips for Huawei. I wonder why?  TSM  also announced they are spending 28 billion in capex, to hopefully  expand and meet the demand. A plant in Arizona, should also help the  American companies who rely on TSM heavily.  Being my first post, any feedback would be much appreciated.  Also thanks to [u/jamseh](https://www.reddit.com/u/jamseh/) for sharing his post, which gave me the idea of sharing mine.

I also believe  the relationship between Taiwan and China have put Taiwan into a  position where it semi depends on the US. With China's economy booming,  the US did not want to give up their baby TSM. They banned TSM, from  making HiSilicon chips for Huawei. I wonder why?  TSM  also announced they are spending 28 billion in capex, to hopefully  expand and meet the demand. A plant in Arizona, should also help the  American companies who rely on TSM heavily.  Being my first post, any feedback would be much appreciated.  Also thanks to [u/jamseh](https://www.reddit.com/u/jamseh/) for sharing his post, which gave me the idea of sharing mine.

I also believe the relationship between Taiwan and China have put Taiwan into a position where it semi depends on the US. With China's economy booming, the US did not want to give up their baby TSM. They banned TSM, from making HiSilicon chips for Huawei. I wonder why?   TSM also announced they are spending 28 billion in capex, to hopefully expand and meet the demand. A plant in Arizona, should also help the American companies who rely on TSM heavily.

I wrote a post yesterday about TSM and the current automotive semiconductor shortage that you can check out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7xmx/tsm\_and\_the\_global\_automotive\_semiconductor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7xmx/tsm_and_the_global_automotive_semiconductor/)  The gist was that TSM is the biggest producer of semiconductors which are experiencing a huge shortage right now, and that the Biden administration is looking into ""immediate action"" to fix the shortage. I think this will be great for TSM's stock price in the coming weeks.  One question I got was: how does American intervention benefit TSM?  My answer: The Chips for America Act.  The Chips for America Act intends to encourage domestic production of semiconductors and was passed as part of the most recent defense spending bill last month. The act has already been authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act and last week American semiconductor manufacturers wrote Biden a letter to fund it.  [https://www.semiconductors.org/semiconductor-industry-leaders-urge-president-biden-to-prioritize-funding-for-semiconductor-manufacturing-research/](https://www.semiconductors.org/semiconductor-industry-leaders-urge-president-biden-to-prioritize-funding-for-semiconductor-manufacturing-research/)  Section 9905 of the act is titled FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS AND MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS SUPPLY CHAINS and here are some screenshots.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/a46yqip826i61.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=885e4c63e15ce5949305716869581af1d730d707  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/mbqp9d2a26i61.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17f7f2f41415881b400ca0840ea11d09bb6dc16d  You can look at the whole act here: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395/text)  Basically the act creates a fund that can give TSM $$$ to supply the US with semiconductors, and allocates funds to ""secure the supply chain,"" i.e. secure it against China. Closer US ties to TSM is great for the company since one of the main concerns investors have over TSM is the possibility of a Chinese takeover.  TLDR: Biden is being pressured to fund an act which would give TSM $$$ and help to defend it from China. This is great for TSM.  Edit: 🚀🚀🚀  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/biden-aide-deese-asks-taiwan-to-help-resolve-auto-chips-shortage?sref=dJOSAJZH](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/biden-aide-deese-asks-taiwan-to-help-resolve-auto-chips-shortage?sref=dJOSAJZH)  &gt;Top White House officials are engaged in trying to resolve the shortage, which has presented an early challenge to Biden’s administration. Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are personally involved in the effort to address bottlenecks in auto companies’ supply chains, a White House spokesperson said.   The spokesperson asked not to be identified by name because the talks have been private.   Taiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views it as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence.   The Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson added.   The formal outreach to Taiwan follows meetings between Deese and Sullivan and U.S. auto companies and their suppliers. The auto industry is leaning on the White House to pressure foreign chipmakers and their governments to allocate supplies to the U.S."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9121793.0|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IKeQaOrmeHIEShNF-N8NcuzsbabSgluDRdqyxFBmlsw.jpg|78.0|140.0|How The US Will Send TSM To The Moon|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme2a0/how_the_us_will_send_tsm_to_the_moon/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2021-02-18|TSM

I first invested in it at  $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.  They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.  I don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://Stockinvest.us) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.  I don't believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else's reasons is wise. It's easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.

Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won’t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 .   Looking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP  ======  2 More traditional/” big players” financial stocks  I have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:  Fintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I’ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can’t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of ""recover"" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.  There’s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.  Looking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM  ======  3 Military and Defense  The mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won’t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).  Looking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)  ======  4 Tech Infrastructures  With everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.  Looking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC  ======  5 Virtual Currency  I am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don’t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks.

I know it can be a risky move, especially for those who don't really have money to play with. But with apps like Robinhood making it a bit simpler to get into the game and buy/sell etc. I figured I'd finally try my luck.     Now I know there's some out there that can drop a few thousand into the market like it's nothing and move from there. However I'm not in that boat and so taking risky chances with what I do have to throw in on a chance that something will jump up is a harder decision for someone like me. At my current rate I figure I can throw in about $50 a week or so, and sometimes more depending on the money I have coming in.     I was wondering what some might think of the decisions I made, based on me assuming the companies I bought into being more 'safe bets' compared to some other options. The stocks I had bought, along with how much I put in (It will be added to and adjusted more evenly over time) are as follows:     **Skyworks (SWKS) - $5**   **Intel (INTC) - $5**   **Nvidia (NVDA) - $5**   **Microsoft (MSFT) - $5**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) - $30**     Nvidia is the one I was most unsure on after buying it, but with what seems like everyone buying GPUs these days, along with a mining surge again, I figured it'd be an okay pick. Not necessarily looking for advice or any of that in the sense of making a bad investment based off of something someone may suggest. Just the thoughts on my choices and possibly adding more to these in the future.     Other options I had considered were Amazon, Apple, and Google. But was unsure on how they would react as the pandemic begins to disappear eventually.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9006805.0|public|confidence|self|||New to Trading|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj2bdi/new_to_trading/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2021-02-13|TSM

We all know we're in a current market shortage of semiconductors. You can see this in the retail markets with GPU and CPU shortages, but we also have a shortage in the industrial sectors too. Our modern economy is rife with robots and computers everywhere from factories to your living room. All of those electronics need semiconductors and chips.   $ON makes Memory, they make audio processors, they make LCD drivers, they make switches, sim card readers, thermal sensors, light readers, motor drivers, DC regulator, and USB controllers. [They make all the shit that makes robots work,](https://www.onsemi.com/products) and they make custom solutions too.   We all know that robots are taking over our jobs, and that robots have been storming manufacturing for the last decade. Now $ON sits on a huge demand for these parts because the other companies like MU and TSM are spending all their resources trying to meet the big GPU and CPU demands.   Other manufacturing is getting left behind in the semiconductor shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars, whether they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions for every manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That means assembly line robots, it means motor controls for cnc machines and shop equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and microwave, it even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending it all after you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the toaster, which uses a power switch, which are made by $ON.   But don't take my word for it. Look at it's charts.  [here's the 3 month.](https://i.imgur.com/YDuwykA.png?1) [here's the 6 month.](https://i.imgur.com/RZo5uTD.png?1) [and here's all time.](https://i.imgur.com/RZo5uTD.png?1)  This thing is primed to go, and already creeping up steadily on the fundamentals. It's already a mainstream company in the manufacturing world, a big name. I think its primed to continue to moon as the current shortage deepens with the ever increasing advancement to smaller and smaller nanonmeter fabrication techniques by the GPU and CPU manufacturers.

The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others.   My thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position.  TLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8930208.0|public|confidence|self|||DD: Missed TSMC?

Did both [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4cpbf/calculating_what_the_gme_price_should_be_for/) and [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktb2ms/gme_ryan_cohen_short_squeeze/).  Now back to the issue at hand:  A while back while reading the comments on an $NNDM DD in here, I came across a guy who said $NVMI is even better than NNDM but he's not going to write a DD on it or promote it any other way on WSB. Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:  Nova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.  Metrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.  Market cap: \~2.2 Billion  P/E ratio: \~42  Has beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)  The stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.  Daily volume is low (about 150,000)  In a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it ""received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions.""  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?  Anyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.  The company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).  I did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.  &amp;#x200B;  Technicals:  I don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.  &amp;#x200B;  My positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021  The options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8615773.0|public|confidence|self|||NVMI: a hidden gem with great upside potential|1.0|[]|0.59|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbp4ds/nvmi_a_hidden_gem_with_great_upside_potential/|some_ads|7.0|1612368180.0|||||||||||||||||2021-02-03|TSM

There’s also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips.  Cars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one.   https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319627-semiconductor-shortage-could-cost-automakers-61b-in-lost-sales  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29T04V  I came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple.   https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM  Now, I couldn’t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true:  Market Cap- 571 billion 2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic).  Earnings- 530billion.    This means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio.   Compare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E. Intel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E  So shouldn’t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%???   I think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12.   Someone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer.   Also, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/25/intels-ceo-just-asked-joe-biden-to-do-this/  Lastly, Biden has a phone call with TSM this Friday.

TSM is getting more orders than they can fill.  One of the concerns with foundries, from a fundamental perspective, is the potential that the high capital costs with expansion can cause the foundries to be underutilized during periods of dormancy in demand. Which historically may have been true, but as we surge forward as a society technologically, semiconductor demand will only increase and increase and increase with time...computing demands, graphics, autos, IoT, everything...TSM has a wide lead with HUGE barriers to entry with foundries.  Bullish checklist:  1. Incredible demand for semiconductors, unlikely to dwindle soon.  2. Monopoly on market share (54%) / world leading production capacity.  3. partnerships with the best fabless firms, apple, amd, nvda, etc.  4. industry leading in technological advancements - ahead of the game on 7nm, 5nm, 3nm, and 2nm r&amp;d  5. not significant antitrust risk as they focus purely on manufacture of semiconductors and have not been trying to buy out other biz  The main risks imo are below:  1. geopolitical risk, literally getting caught in a war/raid between china/us in the semiconductor arms race. &amp;   2. intellectual property theft. Something that I don't think would fatal to them considering the barriers to entry with semis.  https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/3118183/tsmc-gears-mass-production-3-nanometre-chips-high-end-computers-and  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-autos/tsmc-expediting-auto-products-amid-chip-shortage-idUSKBN29X03F  https://www.ft.com/content/13094950-fb45-4686-9ef9-8199c674b90d  Links for your own research.

There will be a lot of IoT devices made off 200mm wafers which should help UMCs revenues.  creation of lower priced more high tech devices does not reduce the demand for older devices because those devices have already been designed into products.

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments.   It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:   AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM     AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops.     AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners.     Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM.   Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM.   Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies.   Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa.   Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips.   Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator.   There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes.   See how many products in your life are powered by TSM.   Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.  The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc.   If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below.   If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1941568.0|public|confidence|self|||🚀TSM World Domination: Beyond the moon.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2s1px/tsm_world_domination_beyond_the_moon/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2021-01-22|TSM

I'M TOTALLY IN  \---  *That is the major reason for the higher price of Taiwan Semiconductor in this country: Taiwan has significant restrictions on foreign ownership of stocks and on the size of the ADR program. Thus, the higher price of the Taiwan Semiconductor ADRs is not necessarily a signal the stock is too expensive; it's just that there is a limited number of ADRs available.*   *The third situation that could trigger a price difference between an ADR and a local share is a restriction on the number of shares that can be owned by foreigners.

Title, basically.  TSMC has steadily been climbing from ~$85 to ~$130 today and it will continue. Why? They are the bottleneck on chip manufacturing for most of the modern chips being printed.   The case: TSM is one of 4 major foundries, and current produces the new M1 for Apple, AMD chips, ARM chips, and more. If it computes something, it's probably printed at TSMC foundries.   They are so good at printing their chips that Intel even uses them now. Intel has their own foundry, but can't figure out how to print chips anymore (we'll see about their new CEO, but that's years out).  Meanwhile, TSMC is opening a new foundry in the USA to help with supply chain concerns in the US, as well as improve volume. https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/tsmc-to-build-a-12-billion-advanced-semiconductor-plant-in-arizona-with-u-s-government-support/  Given that the new admin will push out a ton of money to folks who will buy new computers, this seems good for TSMC. Not to mention all the retards here who will put their federally funded tendie money into the market.   Get in however you want, but just know that TSMC will print all the things for you.

Sony has had to increase production by 50%!  * TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.  * PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.   * The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024  * Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab.   * Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD.   * r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)  * Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter   Oh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)  Right now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age. These are the same losers who just got wrecked by GME. Let's show these fools again. **Stop letting boomers control the OG WSB rocket ship!**  **TL;DR -** AMD is an undervalued sleeping giant currently on sale. Most analysts predict $110, some $120.

Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.  Despite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.  We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn’t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED’s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won’t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.  [Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.  In some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a “hype move” right now. Intel has still fallen behind it’s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.  We also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.   We also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of ¾ of the US population.  Also, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.  While in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.  We also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China’s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.  And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the “big players” who get in at much lower prices.  So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.   🙏Thank you everyone for reading!🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!

What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings &amp; PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).  We saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary &amp; Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small &amp; mid-caps have outperformed.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba &amp; MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.  In [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla &amp; TSM.  We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.  While December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.  So, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.  This week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.  So, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don’t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:  They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.  They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.  The “new battery technology” that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla’s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the “New Solid-State battery” the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.  And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.  Also, I don’t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn’t competition for TESLA 3, it’s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla’s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).  But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla’s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn’t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.  So, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But… I am disappointed in the “new battery technology” and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla &amp; NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.  In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it’s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.  On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.  And don’t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don’t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).  So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points  🙏Thank you everyone for reading!🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!

The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.  The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.  The Columns to pay attention too:  * EXP: Expiration of the contracts * Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised * Option Price: How much premium paid per contract * Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)  # Call Flow  *Processing img asn0bkz3de961...*  To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.  # Put Flow  *Processing img ncsrdwq6de961...*  Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.  # Target Flow  The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img 040n3avbde961...*  Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.  Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium....

What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning!  First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!   So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.  We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.  We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.  Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.  We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.   Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.  Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.  The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.  We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.  [Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.  In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.  We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.  Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.  Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it’s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn’t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.  And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don’t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.  Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

Sure, my DD on [SOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/) has not come to fruition (yet) but 3 for 4 in the last 2 months is not too shabby. In MLB, I would be a .750 hitter and would qualify for HOF but that’s a separate “Story Time” shit-posting for another day.  Today, I am here to share my next DD. And unlike my other DDs, this is a bit speculative.  TLDR: If Apple is building EVs, MGA is likely the manufacturer based on their past partnership and the fact that Apple likes to outsource manufacturing.  **So, what the hell is Magna?**  Today, let me tell you about this sleeping giant called MGA. Few years back (circa 2014-2016), when people first started hearing about Project Titan, aka Apple EV project, MGA was in talks to manufacture Apple EVs for Apple. Dozens of Magna’s engineers were working with Apple to develop Apple’s new baby.   For those who are not familiar with Magna, the company is considered as the world’s biggest contract manufacturer for cars. (Think FoxConn for iPhones or Taiwan Semiconductor for chips)    A big part of their business is to help automakers to manufacture their vehicles when these automakers lack the resources (i.e. factories) or time to build the cars themselves. For OEM automakers, their current and past customers include big names like BMW, Volkswagen and Aston Martin.  [Check out Bloomberg’s feature on MGA back in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-magna-international/)  **Ok. So they are like FoxConn to Taiwan Semiconductor, but for manufacturing cars. So why are they not 🚀 🚀 if they are in bed with Apple?**  Well, Apple’s Project Titan went through a lot of changes since 2016. It struggled with direction, leadership and technical challenges. the guy who lead the project, Bob Mansfield, left the company and then was brought back. They laid off a lot of people from the project and then retooled the scope of the project with focus on autonomous driving and a new battery technology. During this time, their previous deal with Magna also died out.  But now the project is back on track with a rumor to launch as early as 2024. Recently, various companies started mooning based on pure speculation that Apple might be using their parts for the project. (I.e. LIDAR)  However, there’s not much talk about who would build the cars. Well, Apple normally designs the product, but outsources the manufacturing. Considering that other EV manufacturers needed to build their own factories in various parts of the world, Apple would need to do the same. However, their business model would suggest that they would outsource the manufacturing and since MGA was once a partner for Project Titan, it is reasonable to think that Apple will choose MGA for future manufacturing as well. Eventually, news will reach the public but in absence of any news that Apple is making capital investment to build its own auto manufacturing factory, it would likely tap a third party like MGA because Apple lacks the expertise to manufacture cars themselves.  **Ok, But what if MGA is not picked by Apple? What then?**  Well, you ungrateful bastard. I’ve already told you that this DD is a bit different and it’s more speculative than the others.   Considering that MGA is the leader in this field, and Apple tapped them before, two things are clear. One, Apple showed their hand that they intend to outsource the manufacturing in the past. Two, MGA has the relationship and familiarity with the Apple Project.   But Magna has other trump cards in its deck. One, Fisher tapped MGA to build their electric SUVs and the production is expected to begin in 2022. As part of this deal, MGA received 6% of Fisher stock warrants so you know this relationship is going to be a long term partnership.  Secondly, LG Electronics formed a joint venture with MGA to develop EV power trains and other EV parts. LG works with General Motors and Jaguar, so this joint venture can potentially lead to deals with those automakers and it positioned MGA further as a leader in this field of car manufacturing.  Finally, even though they are strengthening their position in EV manufacturing, their bread and butter is their existing contracts with companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW and BMW. In China, MGA has even inked a deal to build entire electric cars for BAIC Group, as many as 180,000 cars annually with the first batch of cars arriving now.  **Recommendation**  Right now the stock is trading around $70~ per share with market cap of only $22 Billion.   Over the next 12 - 24 months, EVs continue to be a hot topic. As more and more people convert to EVs, more EV stocks will moon and MGA will benefit from that conversion. But, if and when Apple confirms MGA as their manufacturer as they disclose more info about their EV between now and 2024, this stock will 🚀 🚀 beyond your dreams. My prediction? $100 by Summer 2021. $140+ by year end 2021.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1737477.0|public|confidence|self|||[MGA] Mother of All Bets, Apple EV Speculative Play for Extra Special Autists|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kj833f/mga_mother_of_all_bets_apple_ev_speculative_play/|some_ads|7.0||||||||||||||||||2020-12-24|TSM

With the rise in interconnectivity of devices, Intel strives to provide the most powerful and energy-efficient silicon solution to any product ""smart and connected."" The data centers used to facilitate the information stored, analyzed, and accessed by various front-end devices are mostly run with Intel server chips. While the firm has had issues with its 10-nanometer process in recent years, I expect the firm to get back on track with its 7-nanometer process in 2021 with the help of EUV lithography. As cloud computing continues to garner significant investment, Intel's data center group will be an indirect beneficiary. Mobile devices have become the preferred device to perform computing tasks and access data via cloud infrastructures that require considerable server build-outs. This development has provided strong tailwinds for Intel's lucrative server processor business. I believe the Altera and other AI-related acquisitions will help Intel maintain its recent growth trajectory in the space, as customers increasingly seek out customized server solutions. The proliferation of mobile devices has come at the expense of the mature PC market, Intel's historic stronghold, with ARM and its cohorts joining AMD as chief rivals. The rise of artificial intelligence has also unleashed a new competitor in Nvidia for specialized chips to accelerate AI-related workloads. Consequently, Intel has built a broad accelerator portfolio via the acquisition of Altera for FPGAs, Mobileye for computer vision chips used in cars, Nervana neural processors, and Movidius VPUs. Intel reported third-quarter results that could be characterized as a mixed bag, including continued strength in cloud spending and notebook PC demand, while enterprise and government data center sales fell significantly and margins contracted. Management had anticipated these trends, though the ultimate mix skewed more to margin-dilutive products such as 5G networking ASICs and notebook PC CPUs than I had expected. While COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation to boost cloud and notebook PC demand to support working and learning from home, other areas of Intel’s broad business have been negatively impacted (such as Internet of Things, Mobileye, and memory). Cloud spending is expected to slowdown after four consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth for Intel’s cloud-related data center group, or DCG, revenue. Shares Ire down nearly 10% during after-his trading and are back to similar levels to the end of July when Intel announced its 7-nanometer process would be delayed at least six months. CEO Bob Swan reiterated Intel’s 2023 products would be made on either Intel 7-nm fabs or external foundries or a mix of both. I like Intel’s recent deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for $9 billion, as it will allow the company to streamline its focus on its core competencies of CPU design and manufacturing while providing a solid cash infusion. Although the next few quarters are likely to be challenging for the firm as AMD continues to attack Intel’s PC and server CPU dominance, I believe Intel’s 10-nm Tiger Lake notebook CPUs and Ice Lake server CPUs should help it mitigate share loss. I are maintaining my $70 fair value estimate for wide-moat Intel and continue to view shares as undervalued. Third-quarter sales Ire down 4% year over year, as PC-centric sales rose 1% and data-centric sales fell 10%. Management expects fourth-quarter sales of $17.4 billion, which would be down 14% year over year. The cyclical industry in which Intel operates will cause its profitability to fluctuate regardless of how successful it is in tailoring its processors to new markets. my uncertainty rating is medium and reflects the underlying risk faced by Intel regarding the proliferation of mobile devices at the expense of PCs, the expanding role of server processors in its product mix, and the advancement of technology nodes to 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, and so on. Relative to other semiconductor firms, I do believe Intel’s scale and market position will allow it to better handle volatility than smaller peers, leading to my medium rating in lieu of high that is commonplace for other semiconductor firms. In the PC space, any misstep by Intel could lead to AMD capturing market share. Any prolonged delay in process technology by Intel would allow other semiconductor manufacturers to quell Intel’s lead and offer processors at the same node as Intel or even surpass it. Recent achievements by Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung seem to have turned this possibility into a reality, with the two foundries reaching the 7-nanometer node (in high volume capacity) in 2018, while Intel pushed out its 10-nanometer products to 2019.

This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:  &amp;#x200B;  **What is Micron Technology?**  They're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage.   **What has been happening during the Rona**?:  Micron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980’s, it’s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It’s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It’s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel’s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in… Utah. That’s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm… which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it’s not even in Wuhan.  Not only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)  &amp;#x200B;  [Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)  **Diversification and Innovation**:  [Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk)   They've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures.   Not only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):  &gt;*176-layer NAND flash:*   &gt;   &gt;In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;With the data revolution taking off, NAND flash demand is supposed to compound at a 30% annual growth rate. Yet many NAND manufacturers have had a hard time making profits in recent years despite that insatiable end demand. Companies have begun stacking NAND modules on top of each other in a 3D vertical structure, with each layer significantly boosting storage capacity. While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;However, Micron's innovation could give it a significant leg up on rivals next year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:  The big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:  &gt; In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).    &gt;   &gt;Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones. And the company is currently number three in market share for memory/storage shipments after Samsung and SK Hynix. DRAM currently makes up about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue with NAND making up most of the rest of the revenue.   &gt;   &gt;DRAM is known for providing high-speed data storage and retrieval. And NAND flash products are electrically rewritable and nonvolatile memory that retains data when power is turned off. This makes NAND ideal for mass-storage uses — specifically for solid-state drives, which have started to displace traditional hard disk drives.   &gt;   &gt;DRAM and NAND are both promising for the future as SSDs are expected to be used in the majority of PCs and data centers as well as higher memory and storage content in smartphones. And AI and autonomous vehicles will also require substantial DRAM and NAND capacities.   &gt;   &gt;Deutsche Bank is not the only brokerage to increase its price target on Micron. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.  They aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:  [Goldman Sachs upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/streetlightning/stock-picks/mircon-computer-memory-dram-nand-technology-mu-semiconductor-goldman-sachs-buy)  [Argus Research upgrades Micron Technologies](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/news?symbol=MU&amp;pageno=&amp;storyid=202012041056MIDNIGHTUSEQUITY_A2316094&amp;provider=MIDNIGHT&amp;product=USEQUITY&amp;sb=1&amp;sc=1&amp;san=1)  [Morgan Stanley upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3205255&amp;headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Morgan-Stanley)  [UBS Upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/micron-shares-jump-after-ubs-boosts-rating-price-target)  [Wells Fargo upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3204494&amp;headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Wells-Fargo)  Theres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.  **The most important bit: How to trade**:  You guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.  First of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.  Second what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.  TLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls.

Here are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense:   Edit because trolls:  Look at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price.   It is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment.   I'm sorry if I'm ""casting pearls before swine"" and this is all going everyone's heads like my [$6 ITM PLTR calls I posted last month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jh2njz/get_in_on_this_while_you_can_pltr_6_itm_call_you/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) But let's stop playing dumb ok? Let's make money.  Also: because so many people say ""AMD BEat IntEl hurrdprorpdr"" ... The success of AMD in PC gaming doesnt negate Intel's success everywhere else:  &gt; At Intel, our strategy is to deliver the world’s best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world. Over the last few years, we’ve initiated a transition from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric one and expanded our product offerings in order to seize new market opportunities.   I'm long AMD, INTC, TSM, and NVDA.  They all will go up. This isn't one or the other.  How tf this shit have 0 votes lmao... you guys are actually dumb af.

If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.    BABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts.   NIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google’s market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu’s and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I’ve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla’s nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They’ve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won’t need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles.   TSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it’s the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary.   How I’m playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I’m counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I’m not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1555205.0|public|confidence|self|||I'm getting the fuck out of US companies.

Then what happened to Mango also made me delay this DD even further, but then I realized it didn't even hurt this stock much. **Motherfuckers we are in Taiwan, the fuck him catching COVID or his death going to do to us!?!** But I also knew I had to not let the WSB pump happen too soon, but it's time. Don't ever say I didn't care about you fucks.  For those fucks who just want my positions here they are: **Oct. 16 90C**!!!! **Jan. 15 100C**!!!!   NOW FUCK OFF.  Everyone else, get your lotion and grab your cock, because it's going to be a long read.  Going forward I will refer to TSMC as TSM since that is there ticker ok?  Hey fucktard, so you've seen TSM pop up a few times but are never interested because the ticker is gay and not retarded enough for you? Surprised you are just realizing other stocks exist besides Tesla? Have no clue what a semiconductor company is? **Don't know where the fuck Taiwan is?!?** I'm sorry, but do you really care? The bitch is going to pop off whether you buy or not. Earnings are this 15th baby and what the fuck are you doing holding bags of shit?  All info until new article linked, comes from 5eeking 4lpha. Navi Bains will be quoted. (use your brain cells and Google the article, gay mods deleted this already smh.)  *"" TSM currently enjoys greater than 50% market share of the $42 billion semiconductor foundry business, with Samsung coming in at about 18%. No other firm holds greater than 8%. According to Technavio, the global semiconductor foundry market was at $65.27 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $91.74 billion by 2024. TSM is well positioned to benefit most from this growing market.

All I am doing is taking key points. He also goes into the risks TSM has but it doesn't mean shit because no one fucks with Samsung and if you really cared, you would search that up yourself.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is the industry leader in semiconductor fabrication. They DO NOT produce their own deigns, but manufacture chips designed by its customers. So they are just a fabrication plant (**foundry**). They also happen to be the WORLD's LARGEST SEMICONDUCTOR FOUNDRY. Basically having a dominant market share compared to their competitors which happen to be: United Microelectronics Corpora $UMC (**NASDAQ listed**) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (which ticker doesn't even matter because it's **HKSE listed**.)  I want you to go look up the price on $UMC right now.  Great you're back. You realized that's a limp dick just moving off of us, and not worth your precious money, or whatever is left. Let's keep going.  "" *They* \[TSM\] *enjoy technological superiority over competitors in an industry that has high barriers to entry and is expected to experience significant growth in the next few years.*""  Which is true because they are ahead of their competition in mass producing 5 nanometer chips and are investing heavily to be the first to have 3 nm chips. Intel is struggling on producing some fucking chip that I can't remember and won't bother looking up because it's not worth my time or yours. Also I'm sure you fucktards know AMD and 7nm chips are, and we are codependent with these fucks. I would say a lot of AMD's success can also be attributed to huge leaps in TSM's manufacturing process, as they have been the enabler for AMD to move to small and smaller die size.  **Don't know what a die is?**   *"" A die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated. Typically, integrated circuits are produced in large batches on a single wafer of electronic-grade silicon or other semiconductor through processes such as photolithography. ""* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_(integrated_circuit)) **OR you could have just opened the link, seen the picture, and assume you knew what it was.**  Those who produce their own designs and manufacture them are called **Integrated Device Manufacturers** (IDMs). Then there are **Fabless semiconductor companies**, which are companies who design there own microchips but have to rely on companies like TSM to manufacture them because they are too hard for their tinny cocks.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.""*  Also Apple event coming up (**on the 13th,** **2 days before Earnings**), &amp; who the fuck knows? Maybe TSM's manufactured chips will still be in them bitches. I'm also well aware that Apple said they are planning to produce their own chips and eventually not use AMD or Intel (think they've been done with Intel), but well. Even then if they do decide to become pussies, who do you think is getting called up to make them? Not fucking anyone who isn't us. Exactly. Once our fucking plant is in the motherfucking U.S. Apple has no excuses than to suck our cocks.

Regardless of profitability, all principal and profits will simply be rolled into further OTM (cheaper) options.   Buying after &gt;20% run up.

It has already ran-up since Monday, but I will be holding through.  Herman Miller makes luxury office furniture (&gt;$1000 office chairs, desks, etc.). Herman Miller took a hit last quarter from their manufacturing facilities and retail segment being closed. They also took a hit in demand with offices closing, and many are still closed. Some people are now working from home permanently. Sentiment for Herman Miller is low. However, Herman Miller has adapted well into the home office chair demand. Don’t believe people would buy a &gt;$1000 chair or a desk that expensive? Look at Restoration Hardware ($RH) and see what happened to them.  Here’s why I’m sitting on Herman Miller calls.  **1.** **Retail Chair sales up:** The biggest reason I’m big on Herman Miller with several subreasons.  **Retail demand up bigly:** With work from home becoming more long-term than realized, people sitting on crappy home chairs doesn’t cut it anymore. They’re looking at luxury-brand chairs to keep their butts from being sore and back from dying, and it doesn’t get more premium than Herman Miller. For most people, this is where their flagship Aeron chair comes in. For those that want a prettier chair, the Sayl chair is available. For a high back chair so you don't need a headrest, the Cosm chair. For a cheaper alternative to the Aeron, the Mirra 2. For gamers, the Embody chair is the ultimate premium gaming chair.   **Social media evidence:** Just check out r/hermanmiller to see that subscribers doubled from June to August alone. Herman Miller’s twitter also gained quite a bit of followers too and the account has been quite busy. Many have posted that their orders could not be placed due to high volume a couple of times. You’ll even find a post by Herman Miller saying that order volume is higher than number and apologize for any delays. It is commonly recommended to people complaining of back pain.   * Streamers are using it, and it’s commonly recommended amongst the gaming/streaming community.   [https://twitter.com/HermanMiller/with\_replies?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauth](https://twitter.com/HermanMiller/with_replies?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauth)  * **List of streamers** that have at least one Herman Miller product: * (TSM and various players, Shroud, TimTheTatman, Tyler1, xChocobars, SF Shock partnership, Meg Kaylee, OrangeJuice, JuliaTV, Elspeth, Friskkmkay, and others)  **Herman Miller X Logitech chair:** Honestly deserves its own number section.  * They recently partnered with Logitech to make a “new” chair. It’s practically the same Embody chair they’ve always had with cool colors and Logitech logo, but that’s all it took to take the gaming/streaming seating industry by storm. They released the chair on July 22. Some supply was manufactured in advance, but 1.5 months later and they are STILL sold out. I assume they’re trying to make as many as they can now. Their website says “Current supply is limited, so by placing your order now, you’ll secure your place in line.” [https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming/herman-miller-x-logitech-g-embody-gaming-chair/100160889.html?lang=en\_US](https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming/herman-miller-x-logitech-g-embody-gaming-chair/100160889.html?lang=en_US)  * Discord is doing a giveaway with one of these chairs along with other Logitech gear.  * (side note: Team Solomid, LCS Summer Split champions announced that they are outfitting their facility with Logitech Embody Chairs) \[Obligatory TSM! TSM! TSM!\]  [https://tsm.gg/news/tsm-selects-embody-gaming-chair-herman-miller-logitech-g-performance-center](https://tsm.gg/news/tsm-selects-embody-gaming-chair-herman-miller-logitech-g-performance-center)  **High margin:** Their last earnings call, they stated that task seating is a “high margin category”. (1000-1500 for a chair!!!)  **Aluminum and steel prices were pretty cheap** most of last quarter and only recently returned to pre-covid prices in August. For office desks and office furniture, lumber is more expensive, but demand is down for those anyways.    **Supply:** Since manufacturing has opened up, they have been focused on pumping out Aeron chairs and Embody chairs. If they didn’t, they probably would have sold out already. They do offer some premium furniture too, but the lead times on those are extremely long most likely due to focus on producing chairs. One redditor mentioned they ordered an Eames ottoman lounge and chair in May and JUST received it a couple days ago. Another redditor looked into getting the same and said he would have to wait until December to receive it.   **2.** **Decisive savings.** They made permanent layoffs and saving measures very early on last quarter compared to Steelcase which saved them a lot of money.  **3. Jobs**: Jobs are not always good indicators as to how businesses are doing but hear me out.  **Manufacturing:** While steelcase recently announced more permanent layoffs and that demand dropped in August, Herman Miller recently posted manufacturing jobs as recently as September 4 suggesting that they need to increase their supply. Business office demand might be down, but retail demand is up.  **Customer Service**: Posted on 9/11 for a Customer Service Engagement position. Their phones have been swamped as retail is up.  **Digital Content Resource Specialist:** Posted on 9/11 investing even more into e-commerce/  Marketing Specialist. This job is to “support the launch of new products across key geographies and vertical markets”. This suggests growth into international markets which I mention later.  **4. Backlog**:   Like their competitor Steelcase, they had a nice backlog to work through June and July because manufacturing was shut down a lot in March, April, and some of May. A lot of work transferred over to this quarter which should boost revenue.   **5. Backwards Ticker**:   Their ticker is backwards of their company name. $MLHR is Miller Herman? It confused me at first when I started doing some DD.  **6.** **Stock is currently extremely low.**   Heman Miller pre-covid was $40 and is now trading around $23. With work from home very much still the trend, people have been selling shares because they believe Herman Miller is still primarily tied to the business office. The office furniture will likely never return to where it was especially with talk of work from home becoming more permanent, but 23 is WAY too low. It went even lower with the stimulus bill being struck down recently so it’s prime for a big spike.  **7. Retail/e-commerce up big**: Ecommerce baby.   **Retail:** Design Within Reach (DWR) is their in-person retail segment for luxury furniture. This is comparable to RH or restoration hardware which recently jumped 20% after earnings. Now that they have been open, DWR is expected to generate quite a bit more than last quarter. They have received quite a bit of bump in google search as well. Also, the steelcase website is AWFULLY slow.   **Reference:** Last quarter, retail was only down 5% DESPITE closing stores in most of march, april, and may. Ecommerce was up 123%. In total, they did $85 million from retail. Based on google search trends, I believe retail stores are up approximately 20% and e-commerce at least an additional 50%. They probably did an extra 30-40 million from retail alone.   **8. Growth**: They are growing outside of the commercial office market unlike Steelcase.  **Maintaining commercial office market:** Some offices did need to rearrange office furniture to space out and maintain covid safety. Herman Miller also offered 15% discounts to businesses to maintain demands (which is about the same cut as they give to authorized dealers so it doesn’t cut into margins much). Some businesses even offered stipends for employees to spend to work from home like Google.   **International market:** From what I can tell from twitter and google search trends, demand for Herman Miller chairs has increased in many countries especially Singapore, Hong Kong, and other countries across the ocean. In many of those countries, Herman Miller doesn’t even have semi-decent supply there besides some retail. Unfortunately, one manufacturing plant in Bengaluru due to a surge in covid cases and therefore has been temporarily closed for 7 weeks delaying chairs. This will detract from earnings a little bit but add to the backlog for next quarter.  **New products:** They are still releasing “new” products. Based off of the Logitech X Embody’s wildly unexpected success, they can expect some pretty good demand with new products. They will definitely mention this in the earnings call.  **No guidance but that’s ok:** They probably won’t have any guidance because business offices are still important, but heavily beating expectations and retail demand increasing will help.  **9. Insider Trading**:  **Promotions**: A couple of promotions gave a couple people some stock options. Not exactly insider trading, but the timing is interesting to give stock options.  **10. Dividend Likely to be Reinstated**: Last earning, they suspended their dividends. I believe they will reinstate their dividend this quarter which should be a really nice sign of confidence for investors to spike this stock after earnings.  **11. Expectations are low:** Herman Miller did 475 million last quarter WITH SHUTDOWN FACILITIES AND RETAIL and is expected to only do 530 million this past quarter which is a considerably low increase. They will probably meet expectations from the increase in retail alone not even including the fact that they will have much of their manufacturing back this quarter and backlog. They are expected to have 0.33 EPS which I feel they will blow out the water thanks to saving measures and high margin chairs.  **Tl;DR**: Debit spreads 22.5/25c 9/18 or 10/16 are super cheap right now at 80c.

The good news is that the company that provides essential semiconductor capabilities to these companies is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.) TSM contractually manufactures chipsets for 499 clients. By focusing solely on contracted production, TSM has the smallest (5nm) chip on the market and a 3nm chip on the horizon, creating an infrastructural economic moat insurmountable even for the aforementioned veteran firms, who struggle to produce 7nm chips by comparison. Recently blowing Intel out of the water, TSMC is years ahead of its competitors.  TSMC is trading at a 26.67 P/E ratio, compared to NVDA's 91 P/E and AMD's 152 P/E ratio. One reason for this cheap valuation is that people think Taiwan may be invaded by mainland China. As a student of international relations specifically studying Cross-Strait relations, I can tell you this is a fallacy. Taiwan-United States relations have never been better, and the United States even has a bill that almost explicitly says The United States will protect Taiwan in the event of an attack. [https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan)  https://preview.redd.it/e5ez47gq9jm51.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6e97224e63f2b8eec427fb924111f7f5adaacc  Another reason why people may be scared of TSMC's future is because of mainland China's desire to get into the semiconductor industry. Recently, however, rumors that TSMC employees have been poached to mainland China's were proven false. The company is dead in the water, leaving TSMC as the sole fab. [https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304) TMSC is also expanding production capacity by planning a massive $12bn manufacturing facility in Arizona, showing clear growth potential.   After great news in late July, the stock has shot up about 20%. Since then, it has successfully tested a base of $77 time and time again. The 10-week line (in red) is rapidly approaching this base, and the company is ready to shoot off.   https://preview.redd.it/t7due2ot8jm51.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c3ae01dde9f878ac05e5f0b89cae19d47677e52  Think about it: with Neuralink, self-driving cars, faster cell phones, drones, electronic body implants and accessories, and more automation, what product will be in the highest demand?

Currently making videos for the Max Tech YouTube channel.   This is going to be the most important positive change for Apple ever since I started. You literally have no idea.   — The iPhone 12 is getting released with the A14 chip that will be so much more powerful than the Qualcomm chip in android phones that they won’t be able to catch up for years. (The new 865 plus is hardly faster than last year’s overpriced 865)   — this will be achieved by using TSMC’s brand new 5nm technology which is gonna be more powerful and more power efficient than people are expecting.   — TSMC is already working on their 3nm tech that will be going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs.   — they are gonna implement 5G across their iPhone lineup without raising the prices crazy high like other brands like Samsung are forced to do right now.   — leaks have shown that the iPhone 12 pro will come with the widely requested 120Hz display and insane camera recording features (4K at 240fps)   — their Apple silicon chip Macs are gonna be so good and so powerful using TSMC’s 5nm tech that people’s minds will be blown. The new features and battery life are gonna be game changers.   — the transition period to ARM-based chips will be much smoother than people are expecting.   — these Macs will likely also have models with support for 5G cellular.   — their new iPads are gonna start getting redesigned with a modern design for the first time in years. While the android tablets aren’t getting much better. Huge demand upswing.   — the Apple Watch is gonna support more sensors and features than ever before, and they’re gonna release a brand new budget model for the first time.   — Apple is gonna release their brand new services bundles which are gonna be very popular, and we all know that services are where the money is at.   — Apple is gonna release a new Apple TV which will begin to get marketed as a gaming console. They’ll release a new gaming controller at the same time that will work across all of their Apple devices including the iPhone.   — Apple will release a HomePod mini to better compete with the Amazon echo and push their Apple Music sales.   — Apple is gonna begin to switch most of their devices to Mini-LED displays on their devices which will be almost as good as OLED without all of the drawbacks.   — The stock split is gonna allow a bunch of new investors to get in after they realize all of this is happening.   Those are just a few of the reasons why Apple has even more room to grow within the next year. -Vadim from the Max Tech channel on YouTube.   Positions: wait for correction and dip after stock split.

You probably made a 10bag on AMD over the last 6 months. But you're not smart yet. Because silicon is layers and we can go a layer deeper.   I won't go in deep on $TSM aka TSMC, but you must know that they're the absolute fucking tits and make the best silicon including for apple and AMD. The reason the Nvidia 3090 will be the size of a model Y is that it's built on Samsung silicon because TSMC is booked out - also the reason why shintels chips suck ass. If you're like me you also made a bagger on TSM.  BUT let's do better and go another level down - ASML make the nice machines that make all of it possible. Look them up. You can get them on the Nasdaq. They truly have unique technology not available anywhere else. They're Dutch which is noice. If China bombs Taiwan to shit, asml sell machines. If china makes its own chips, it buys asml machines. If TSMC build a fab in Texas, they buy asml machines. If shintel decide 14nm+++++++++++++++++++ is dead, they will buy asml machines.   Buy the stock, get September options, whatever. It doesn't matter. They're 8% below peak in the current market so you've got a free 8% move over the next few months especially because AMD is going to start releasing soon and the street is going to start asking why the AMD&gt;TSM&gt;ASML supply chain is working so well and the answer is ""the Dutch make grade-A nugz"""|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1432681.0|public|confidence|self|||Layers upon layers in silicon|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/igf1fz/layers_upon_layers_in_silicon/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||||2020-08-25|TSM

Since then, I've gained a lot of money, and I've lost a lot of money. My best predictions so far have been:  TSM 80c 8/21 and 8/28 bought around 67 before the run-up   FSLY 80p 8/7 bought before earnings sent it to 116, then I held til it went all the way down to 77  AAPL 500c 8/21 which didn't go ITM, but we all saw what happened there.   So, recently, I've been doing my own DD rather than listening to the retards in the daily chat, as it seems we've been invaded by penny stocks. Due to this, I've been a little less active. My most recent trade to hit was SPY 342 8/24.   I'm looking at the top 50 highest open-interest stocks, or basically seeing which options have the most amount contracts open. Not necessarily a great way to decide how to buy stocks, but it is a good way to track volume, where the trends are moving, and sometimes see outliers, like the TSM 80c on 8/28 that hit and made a lot of people rich.   I noticed a stock called HYG, which people don't really talk about on this sub. HYG is iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF - basically it tracks corporate debt, including junk bonds, but is much more stable than investing in junk bonds, as it will increase with these bonds, but will not dip nearly as bad if these bonds experience issues. One thing that immediately stood out was how high the put-to-call ratio was. Other sticks were more-or-less around 1, with the highs being around 1.66 and the low being around .51. The p-t-c ratio of HYG? 5.67. Yes you read that right - five point fucking six seven.   I decided not to stop there. I looked at its dips in the past - it's high was around 88, but its low was only 67, and happened during the market crash in February. The crazy thing? It went right back up to high 70s, then back into the 80s diary quickly. Right now it is sitting at 85ish. So this made me think twice about going into this stock - if it's so stable, why would people all of a sudden think they should buy puts on this stock, if it'll just bounce right back?   After digging around, I found this article that isn't really worth reading, but it had one fact I hadn't seen yet: the Fed is slated to stop buying corporate bonds on September 30th, and some people don't think they should keep buying them up after that date ends. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-06-15/fed-doesn-t-really-need-to-buy-corporate-bonds  I started looking at different DTEs. I noticed September 18th, they had strikes with 100s of thousands of open contracts. Even the ones around those had 10s of thousands of contracts open. I did some more reading - found that some of those contracts were coming from hedges (people buying puts after buying shares, or hedge funds). This explains the vast amount of contracts. The thing that made it even more interesting was that over the next several months, the open interest on strikes such as 82 and 79 stayed really consistent. Like 10s of thousands of open interest all the way into January.   That's when I decided I should buy puts, but I didn't know what date I should go far. My hypothesis: if a lot of people expect things to go to shit in September, but the Fed isn't supposed to stop buying until after September, so I am recommending a few different strikes:  HYG 9/18 83p  HYG 10/16 82p HYG 11/20 79p  Or some variance of those strikes and you should be good literally can't go tits up.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1432522.0|public|confidence|self|||Puts on HYG|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/igdrue/puts_on_hyg/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||||2020-08-25|TSM

Im just going to point out of few things that convince me NIO is not just an Ev company but will eventually become a tech company.   As we all know NIO held a press conference 08/20 announcing BaaS (Battery as a Service) which is actually old news as it was mentioned Q42019. What many aren’t mentioning is NIOs Powercloud announcement.   https://youtu.be/fboyjQEju9A  Power Cloud covers 95% of the Chinese markets power resources in the market. This means through NIO’s app the user can determine what their best charging solution would be leveraging not only NIOs resources but also the public outlets as well. Then we have NOMI.   Nomi is NIOs avatar of AI and is an internal personal assistant, which is similar to Alexa or Siri but eventually they want to tighten the gap between user and machine further. (Nomi even takes selfies. )The name NOMI comes from combing the words “Know” and “Me” which refers to the cars company’s mission to peruse AI.   Tencent is currently NIOs largest individual share holder at 15.1% ownership of the company  and is the second decision maker on their board right after CEO William Li.   https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-tencent-offers-pivotal-support-for-nio-stock-moving-forward-2020-06-30  In NIOs interview with Bloomberg they mention they only collaborate with companies that share the same long term visions. https://youtu.be/Bjoco_Gh0YY referencing their relationship with Mobileye. Will get to that in a bit, back to Tencent.   Tencent has also led an investment of 90m in a startup from India named Lilium Aviation. Lilium, is a flying car start up that has already documented a successful flight of their Eagle which is an electric jet. Lilium is all working on a larger model it calls “Air Taxi.”🚀  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/business/dealbook/lilium-flying-car.html  MobileyeXNIO   Ok since 2018 NIOXMobileye have had an ES8 prototype but publicly announced it Q42019.  (Jim Cramers faggot ass,in the video below, is here on Mobileye’s dick praising Mobileye yet talks down on NIO, what a dumb ass!) Mobileye promises Robotaxis by early 2022 had has already confirmed it will use NIO as their official vehicle supplier in China for this. Tsla is also perusing Robotaxis 🤔 NIO has also already encouraged its customers to ride share leveraging the NIO app and has mentioned that EV and ride sharing is not enough to relieve congestion and pollution, which hints at them looking into other forms of transportation.  https://youtu.be/5bN2KCiiQ-8  Mobileye was acquired by Intel in 2017. Have you heard of Intel? They make like cool tech thingys and like some computer stuff or semiconductors IDK . They may be going places 🤷🏽‍♂️ (Even if they have to use $TSM for production)  That’s what I have for now. I hope this is up to your DD standards.

We all know Nvidia is killing it at the moment so I am not going to go all DD in this post.   However, when looking at the best option plays, the NVDA ATM straddle for 08/21 is still doing 7/8% which is ridiculous. After all the upticks in the last days, there is no much upside left I believe so the best play is to buy calls in the best performing stocks in the same sector. They will get a similar boost as well but option premium is less in these stocks because they don’t contain QE premium anymore. Also these sectors will still be trending up mainly because of the rotation that is still taking place within big market participants (i.e. Buffet dropping banks and picking up gold)  The best companies in sectors relevant to where Nvidia operates, as well as favorites in the current sector rotation are TSM, AMD and ASML.

Vadim Yuryev here from the YouTube channel Max Tech.   I've been covering a lot of Apple products and Macs for the last 4 years ever since I started working for Appleinsider.   As you all know, Apple has recently announced that they're switching to their own custom Apple Silicon Mac chips, which will of course be built exclusively by TSMC on their brand new 5nm process (World's first)  What most people don't know is that they've been working toward this transition for many years. For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.  These 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC.   Because of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips.   A major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.  And a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.  And unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.  Developers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:   [https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)  [https://twitter.com/never\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)  And this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling.   That chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.  Apple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.  And Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling.   Because of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.  So right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.  The A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.  The new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.  There will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.  This same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13"" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24"" iMac.   One of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro.   I'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording.   Basically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November.   These chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code.   And if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)  Because of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.  Their main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.   ""A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC""  [https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)  So Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.  TSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)  What if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology?

TSMC is gonna skyrocket this year. 2020 is literally TSMC's little bitch.  I'm right and you fucking know it.   The upcoming PS5, Xbox 1, Big Navi AMD GPU's, Nvidia RTX 3000's, Ryzen 9's, zen 3's are all the most hyped products in recent years within their respective markets. And who manufactures all of these CPU's and GPU's?  TSMC.  These products are so hyped everyone's gonna buy one or the other from the items above. You'll be asking why these products weren't released when lockdowns were first issued. Lockdown will be voluntary after these products are released.   Face value TSMC's market price (NYSE: TSM) may seem priced in, overvalued, or whatever the fuck you gay bears come up with but I'm telling you this shit is gonna skyrocket by the end of 2020. And I don't give a fuck if Huawei is out of the question.  Any idiot knows that TSMC  has a fucking monopoly on the rest of the CPU/GPU manufacturing market. TSMC spoon feeds NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, and etc all their CPU/GPU demands. They're literally pushing Samsung out of certain deals.   Oh right I forgot about the autists. Let me explain.   Taking an example outta the CPU side of things,  X86 is the type of chips that AMD and (the late) intel produce. X86 is the current most dominant and powerful type of  computing chip widely accessible to consumers. You've all heard of Nvidia buying ARM or some shit. ARM is a ""prospective"" type of chip good for low-power consumption. It hasn't been developed enough to produce the same computing power as X86 yet, but in the future it will. In summary, ARM is good because ARM is good for saving power consumption and battery life.   Apple uses ARM patents in their Iphones and shit, and ARM basically has/will dominate the mobile devices market. Ipads, Iphones, Ipenis, you name it.   Some people say ARM will replace X86 someday. Who fucking knows.   But on the manufacturing side of things, ARM, just like X86, is just a manufacturing LICENSE in its essence. It's just a bunch of design drawings. ***Actually*** MANUFACTURING these CPUs and GPUs is so expensive and so complex that practically only two companies can supply and meet the material demand **licensing** companies such as AMD, Apple, and Nvidia ask for. That's TSMC and samsung. And samsung is too gay to trade on NYSE/Nasdaq.  Point is, all of the incredibly hyped CPU and GPUs of 2020 and in recent years which everyone will buy will be coming out of TSMC in 2020. Oh, and TSMC is also future proof so just  go ahead and buy 10,000 shares and 400 calls.   Thank me later.    &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: Go all in on TSMC short and long term."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1394115.0|public|confidence|self|||TSMC--calm before the 🚀🚀 moon🚀🚀|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4xq9o/tsmccalm_before_the_moon/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||||2020-08-06|TSM

I read the FAA's 96 page summary on the 737 MAX and have the following to report. Here is the link in case you want to read for [yourself](https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/737-MAX-RTS-Preliminary-Summary-v-1.pdf).  There were 7 different safety items addressed in the report. The biggest issue was the Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor and the way it allowed the pilots to interact with the plane. This sensor would basically override any actions the Pilots wanted to take and the false readings lead to the crashes years ago. The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.  Another issue was with the ""maneuvering characteristics augmentation system"" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).  Looking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:  *  Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS) * Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements * Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX  Additionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:  * For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes * All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.  After this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:  *  strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point * be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry   The rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.  **TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment\***  [**BA TOP SUPPLIERS**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionNO4.php?supply&amp;code=BA)  * TAITRON COMPONENTS - TAIT (no options) * MSFT - whatever you retards are buying for Tik Tok is fine.

I just realized how weird Christmas will be...  I bought my shares for both accounts as per the voodoo ritual of purchasing at least 1 stock of a long term call strategy.

A little over 3,000% between 2 contracts that cost $75 total.  Along the way, i picked up RH tendies and rebalanced the cash / bought more contracts and shares. They're officially part of the DRIP.  http://imgur.com/gallery/UFKPnOz   Related post I made last week regarding TSM and INTC. Any thoughts on how US semi production will play out for them?  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0jqtu/opinions_on_taiwan_semiconductor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  Last week, The Fool confirmed many of the LT bias I had been building up on a win for The Foundry since November. All hype, or real talk?  https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/31/3-tailwinds-are-lifting-tsmcs-stock-to-new-all-tim.aspx  Financial analysis- This guy is boring af, but he goes through the numbers that no one likes to read, records in mobile, and is cool enough to zoom in on what he is talking about.  https://youtu.be/wVxF7wwuogo  Can anyone see a downside other than ""COVID CLAP Trumps all""? Maybe I've been chewing too much YouTube tinfoil on lunch, but the limit orders that are closing 930-4pm are making me think I've hit the Autistic Lottery. Wish I had bought more.  Friday, all I could see was a bull flag on the 4hr and 30min charts. Monday 8/03 it hasn't shit the bed at 11am EST. Maybe thats just the tin foil talking again and this is the ceiling.  http://imgur.com/gallery/nRYKBB5"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1385642.0|public|confidence|self|||TSM and Me 2020|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i2z2te/tsm_and_me_2020/|no_ads|0.0||||||||||||||||||2020-08-03|TSM

I normally play this sector through $SOXL, which can be a bit choppy, but has had an amazing move off the March lows, and is nowhere near finished.   Stocks like $TSM and $AMD have had big moves recently, but $MU has been lagging behind.   Note after note has listed this one as one to own in the second half of this year. The stock has been consolidating over the last month around some key moving averages, much like the others did before they made their moves.

$MSFT, and $TSLA... it only leaves me to wonder if their rally can continue. If you hold interest in any of the ARK Fund ETFs - especially ARKK which is 10% $TSLA - your portfolio is probably looking pretty good.  I've wrote some good DD, made some great plays, and I've missed on a few plays over the past few weeks. I'm hoping for three winners this week; let's skip the bullshit and get into the plays!  \-  First on the list is a hedge play: **$SLV**  I'm a precious metals bug... I like $GLD, I like $SLV, I've played the miners and leveraged ETFs... I like physical more than paper, but I like the ETFs nonetheless. I've followed gold and silver for a long time and I've had a very bullish view on it for a long time. It's been a solid investment to park a small percentage of your portfolio and forget about it. Bring on the hate I'm ready to discuss the pros and cons of this investment.  Today, the gold/silver ratio is around ATHs at 91:1. One autist posted a discussion post about silver a year ago and I commented on his post about my bullish opinion on the shiny substance. The gold/silver ratio at the time was... 91:1... the ratio has fluctuated quite a bit since then but today it is right back at 91:1.  \-  Alright, this is WSB and none of you want to hear about my gay bear hedge plays... Let's move on to the next play: **$SNAP**  [1D chart](https://preview.redd.it/ehu6khij84c51.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c9f49a0b00e281e7e3b27aa92fed19cbfe906f2)  [4H chart](https://preview.redd.it/8fqbzcdm84c51.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e11d2ad66e77d059b6d5c83676a146da1351c5cd)  I'm a long term user of the Snapchat app. I like the $SNAP stock and I have held shares for a minute. $SNAP is trading in the IPO price range for the first time since the IPO. This is a very important range and watching for a break out above resistance will confirm a bullish trend.  RSI is relatively bullish, maybe a little overbought, but this is a tech stock and we all know tech stocks can rally for a long time before getting exhausted. MACD is also bullish and may be signaling an increase in momentum as $TXN tests the breakout level.  Take a look at the first chart. There was a pathetic failed rally in 2018 - 2019. Look at the rally we are experiencing today. That's not a V-shaped recovery that's an uber erect check mark recovery! This stock could really break out at this level!   Things to remember: $SNAP is nearing profitability. It's in a better situation today fundamentally than it was at IPO. The stock has opportunities on the horizon with things like the TikTok ban and the general increasing trend of video chat technology and platforms.  ER is tomorrow after hours. The option chain is pricing in \~$1.75 move on the upside with volume and open interest both very bullish.  I will be holding shares and looking at the September 30c tomorrow for a good entry. If those are too expensive I might explore the chain and sell some credit spreads.  \-  I like writing about chip stocks because I strongly believe that chips are the future. I'm not talking about tortilla chips... I'm not talking about fish n chips you british retard... I'm talking about semiconductors and more specifically **$TXN.**  [1D chart](https://preview.redd.it/drngmtsua4c51.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca2ec6974e66ef59fb3a7b367966e7ab74e421ee)  [4H chart](https://preview.redd.it/unbwt1yya4c51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50c34a1c34732d178bd6ecf1c48dbe16707123ad)  [Comp. returns](https://preview.redd.it/c8iof4s0b4c51.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e092ebb529ec94d217e45f218904a1e6df46b05)  Texas forever; $TXN forever. I like Texas Instruments for a number of reasons. The company is very profitable. Recent EPS have fallen between $0.90 and $1.50. That's a solid performance compared to its peers!   RSI and MACD are both bullish and signaling the possibility of huge upside. I like where $TXN falls among its peers on the % return chart. I think it can really fill the gap between its return and the recent leaders $NVDA and $TSM.    Note, $TSM has a small beat and didn't react very well. $TXN is a huge player that could definitely surprise. Ultimately, there will only be a few big winners in the chip sector and I'm putting a bet on $TXN to come out a winner.  The option chain is pricing a $4.50 move on the upside; volume and open interest are both bullish on the chain.  What do I like? I'm looking at the September 160c and 165c.

First a bat on a coin, then a bloody bear market, but what’s next? Well volcanos spew lava and kill most of everything nearby but afterward form lush green mountains that grow taller still! And this peak is literally named rainmaker!   So SPY is clearly going to $500 or $1700 I haven’t figured that part out yet. Your input is appreciated. But in the same vein of islands in the Pacific Ocean, tech darling Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co should be up for a seismic bull run.

I’ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here’s why:  TSM $64  TSM is the world’s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica’s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about.   Aside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world’s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world’s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies.   And for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I’d say we hit at least $70 by EOW.   [https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)  All the “financial experts” rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays….

However, as we head deeper into a global recession, the goodwill sentiment will increasingly sour”. Market share: HP (HPQ) 25%, Lenovo 24.1% (LNV GY), Dell Technologies (DELL) 16.6%, Apple (AAPL) 7.7%, Acer Group 6.7%.  #DOW JONES   **Merck &amp; Co.

TSLA fuckboy here writing a post about video games. Go figure. I posted the link about Daddy Elon and legalizing weed last weekend, and ***got fucking*** ***temporarily banned*** for it because I flaired it with DD. It definitely wasn't DD. Learn from my mistake and don't fuck around with flairs or the mods. In my defense, I have ADHD, was high af, and am likely retarded. I served my sentence, and am here to try to redeem myself with some real DD on Activison-Blizzard (ATVI). I actually wrote this a few days ago when ATVI was $68 (proof attached), but couldn't post it until now. That's ok though, I committed a sin and you all have to pay the price by getting this DD 4 days late (love you mods). Don't fret though (like the market this morning wtf), there is still time for tendies.  I'm long ATVI. They are going to steadily rise for the next 5-10 years. In the paragraphs below, you'll learn why. To be fair, I bought puts on BYND when it was trading at $70 in April, so, *I'm pretty fucking smart*. Do your due diligence (or fucking don’t, whatever). *Obligatory this is not financial advice.*  Pictures, positions and **TL;DR at the bottom** for those of you that don’t know how to read (and let’s be honest, most of you don’t know how to read. Most of you need crayons to *eat* while you look at pictures. Lookin at you 220p SPY bag holders lmao.) That or you have the [attention span of the stock market in March](https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-MARKETS/0100B5L144C/index.html). Either way, enjoy!  # Long-Term thoughts  You know that saying, the one that rich-fucks who inherited a bunch of money from their crazy aunt (they've never even met this Aunt obviously) say, “You gotta make your money work for you or you'll never be rich!” Yeah, well fuck those people. I got one better. I make ogres and trolls and wizards and guns (oh my) do the work for me, and it turns out they work really fucking hard, 24/7/365.  Activison-Blizzard is one of the biggest powerhouses of the video game industry and I think they have a tremendous opportunity for growth in the long term. They are also recession/virus/pandemic/protest proof. And in reality, most of these things actually make ATVI more attractive.  Can’t go outside because there's a fucking curfew (we have to be in a simulation), or your downtown is literally on fire from a protest and there’s a deadly virus just hanging out on every corner trying to murder your grandma? Cool. You don’t give a fuck because you’re sitting in your Lovesac (just fucking don't), playing COD while eating your BYND meat fake burger with a non-gmo, organic, gluten-free lettuce wrap with a 42oz Monster at 3 am. Why face reality when video games are so much more fun, AND you don't have to put on pants. Also, the gov is literally handing out money to people on unemployment.  Put on your thinking cap and think really fucking hard for a second. *Really hard.* Do you think there's a correlation between people that are unemployed (and getting insane unemployment payments + stimulus + more stimulus at the end of July and are basically being **ENCOURAGED TO STAY HOME**), and the likelihood of that person playing video games? Hmm. FUCKING MAYBE.  **Earnings** \-  **They make lots of money lol**  They have *crushed* [recent earnings](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/2697764c-6dfa-47da-898b-0ee1ab2d3439) (and most other earnings), and they have [really fucking solid financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ATVI/financials?p=ATVI). Boatloads of cash on hand and relatively low debt. They have rock-solid management that has been there for years, and they are devoted to the company. Here's some great info on [how they make money](https://www.investopedia.com/how-activision-blizzard-makes-money-4799286).  Also, **most importantly,** u/fuzzyblankeet said *""they are a great company""* (proof attached) and that guy doesn't fuck around.  **Current and upcoming games**  1. **COD -** (literally prints fucking money every single release) and the new free-to-play [Warzone mode has been insane](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-reaches-another-huge-player-m/1100-6476877/), taking tons of market share from Fortnite and PUBG. They also have gotten tremendous traction with their [COD Mobile game](https://dotesports.com/mobile/news/cod-mobile-surpassed-180-million-downloads-with-second-best-launch-ever-in-mobile-games). They will also obviously announce a new COD for the next-gen consoles coming from Microsoft and Sony, Holiday 2020. This holiday season will *unquestionably* be the most gigantic video game fiesta the world has ever seen, and COD will be the Fucking King. Mark my words. 2. **Overwatch 2 -** No date announced yet, but you can bet your allowance (that your wife's boyfriend gives you) that they're gonna try and get it out during the Holiday season. I bet it sells 45-55 million copies, on top of all the micro-transactions, [similar to its predecessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)). 3. **Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal -** Diablo's fan base are addicts. [Blizzard killed it with Diablo 3](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/08/05/believe-it-or-not-diablo-3-is-now-the-10th-best-selling-video-game-of-all-time/#35d2cf4c2ab4), and many people expect these 2 new games to be even more epic. One of them being a console game similar to Diablo 3 (for next-gen consoles obviously), and the other being a free-to-play (micro.fucking.transaction'$) game made for iPhone/Android (lol losers). Much smaller fan base than COD/Overwatch, but still, 10's of millions is pretty massive. 4. **WoW -** Not what it used to be, but still has a large player base of millions. They are releasing another new expansion this year and the revitalization of its [classic Wow has been a hit](https://www.newsweek.com/world-warcraft-subscriptions-triple-classic-release-1461086). 5. **Hearthstone -** More than 100 million people have played the game as of 2018 (most recent data I could find). I'd guess that with their new Battlegrounds Mode, in addition to multiple yearly expansions, this game will continue pulling in significant revenue for years to come, especially if they find ways to invent new game modes that bring old players back. 6. **Starcraft -** Although this area of the business doesn't make them much money right now, I think it's safe to say that the Starcraft Universe still carries a lot of weight in a lot of gamers' minds. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Starcraft 4 or some mobile variation of it in the next 3 years, and I think that it would do excellent. 7. **Hero's of the Storm -** The game is still played, but is definitely one of the smallest revenue generators for them. 8. **Revitalizing Spyro and Crash Bandicoot -** Although there is no real news on theses getting re-vamped, ATVI thinks of them as a [flagship brand](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/06/05/activision-blizzard-considers-crash-bandicoot-and-spyro-flagship-brands/). I bet they sell a shit load of copies each on console if they go that route, especially the Nintendo Switch (which happens to be [in the hands of 55 million people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/687059/nintendo-switch-unit-sales-worldwide/)). 9. **Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 Remaster -** Yeah, they are [remastering this shit](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254430/tony-hawk-pro-skater-remaster-ps4-xbox-one-pc-release-date). You remember how badass these games were back in the day.  Set to release Sept, 2020. I actually think this might be a surprise revenue generator. It'll sell 25-35 million copies. 10. **King Digital Entertainment -** [ATVI bought them](https://www.forbes.com/companies/king-digital-entertainment/#d7a79482ed68) for around 6 billion a few years back, and it's pretty clear that this was a wise purchase. Their suite of current games and upcoming games/expansions should continue to print money and at a good margin. They are a dominat player in the mobile space, and could leverage those users to try other games from ATVI (Diablo Immortal) 11. **Tv show -** Pretty strong rumors that Blizzard is working on a [few TV shows](https://www.polygon.com/tv/2020/2/18/21142292/overwatch-diablo-netflix-animated-shows-blizzard-linkedin-leak) based on their Diablo and Overwatch worlds. Animated TV shows are [growing in popularity, even for adults.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/05/22/avatar-the-last-airbender-was-the-most-watched-show-on-netflix-this-week/#599046b05d9c) Both of these shows will attract ALL blizzard fans (100's of millions around the world), and lots of new people too, as I'm sure they'll make it easy enough to digest for someone who doesn't know the game/universes already. This could also bring brand new people into the *Blizziverse*. And I'm sure Netflix/HBO Max/Apple TV would be happy to pay a pretty penny for rights to it.  # E-Sports -  The Future of 'sports' entertainment  E-Sports will largely replace real sports in our lifetime, and we’re just now really getting started. Disagree? Great, I don’t give a fuck. Go ask any 10 year-old this question. “Hey little Johnny-Sue. Would you like to watch some sweaty dudes smash into each other for 3 hours, or would you rather watch your favorite team play in their respective competitive E-Sport league on Twitch?” 9/10 times, Lil-fuckin-Johnny-Sue gonna pick video games, and that's a fact.  **Teams and Orgs**  [Esports are also BOOMING in colleges](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/02/06/why-the-rise-of-esports-is-good-for-schools-students-and-even-employers/#323f2a3c6f50), with lots of colleges offering significant scholarships to come play video games for their school. Let me help you draw a mental picture. *Concentrate.*  Remember Lil-Fucking-Johnny-Sue from above? If he/she gets good enough at whatever game he/she is playing, they could get a full-ride scholarship to college, and then possibly get a job afterwards as a professional Esports athlete (and [make more money then a CPA](https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-league-teams-schedule-salary-rules-format-2019-11#call-of-duty-league-players-will-have-a-minimum-salary-of-50000-along-with-other-benefits-1) makes their first few years of working). THEN, when he/she gets too fucking old and slow to play the game (25-30 years old typically) they can become an analyst, caster, coach, manager, scout, etc etc. Maybe they become the next [N0tail](https://dotesports.com/business/news/top-earning-esports-players-21870) (highest paid Esports athlete to date) and make a cool 6.8 million a year. Imagine making 6 figures a year to play fucking video games and rekt n00bs on stage. Fuck I want that life so bad.  There are literally stadiums being filled with fans to watch people play video games, while another 100 million people watch from home. Esports organizations are becoming bigger and bigger. TSM is a major Esports organization in the US and they are building a [$50 million facility in LA](https://www.dailyesports.gg/tsm-announces-50-million-esports-facility-in-los-angeles/). [More words](https://www.oneesports.gg/features-and-opinions/5-of-the-worlds-most-over-the-top-esports-facilities/) on other organizations to help put things into perspective. While these facilities are clearly impressive, this is **nothing** compared to [major sports facilities](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1211/the-5-most-expensive-stadiums-in-the-world.aspx).  Here's my point. Is it reasonable to assume that these facilities/teams/Esports stadiums/orgs will continue to get bigger? And if they get bigger, they will [demand more attention](https://www.looper.com/44783/10-games-revolutionized-gaming/) from celebrities/rich folk because they want to get in on the action. As a result, the salaries of players/managers/staff/coaches/analysts will continue to go up and there will be more and more opportunities for jobs in this field. This then causes more young people to be more interested in video games, because not only are they fun af (and insanely addictive), but you could play pro someday! Schools/colleges will continue to develop competitive Esports teams because A: You better fucking believe that there are lots of kids out there that care about this and B: The school knows that it could lead to jobs (more like a dream job, but still something that's reasonable to consider if you are really good at a video game).  Still disagree? More words for you to look at and not understand.  [Blizzard Esports Revenue](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/12/things-know-activision-blizzard-1b-esports-deal.aspx)  There are competitive [(money generating) Esports leagues](https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-16-call-of-duty-esports-franchise-25-million.html) for 7 different ATVI games. (Overwatch, Hearthstone, WoW, COD, COD Warzone, COD Mobile, Starcraft). Here are some thoughts from Pete Vlastelica ([head of E-Sports at Blizzard](https://www.newsweek.com/activision-blizzard-esports-president-future-plans-overwatch-call-duty-league-1486570)).  E-Sports will be 10x in 10 years. Bet your bottom dollar on it.  # Technicals - (kinda, but only 1 cause fuck TA)  Honestly, just fucking look at the 50-day moving average (image attached). They crashed and burned cause Rona (so did everything else you autist). But Rona has been canceled, and even if it hasn't, ATVI is gonna be better off because of it.  **TL;DR** \- ATVI makes a lot of money and they are in a strong position to grow and make lots more fucking cash regardless of C19/protests/riots and they might actually do even better because of it. (3 -12 months = 80's) (12-24 months = 90's.)  Yolo 100c mid-2021.  EDIT: misspelled ATVI ticker one time in post and some autist called me out. Fixed.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.  # **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers. ***** &gt; Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson &amp; Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now. ***** &gt; “Most of the slowdown occurred in March,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Do we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You’re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it’s going to be more companies doing that, than not.” ***** &gt; Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed’s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy. ***** &gt; The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales. ***** &gt; “People are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,” said Hogan. “We got another massive increase in jobless claims. That’s ignored because we’re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, ‘we know this and you should pull your guidance.’” ***** &gt; Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv’s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter. ***** &gt; Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11. ***** &gt; Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed’s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets. ***** &gt; Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%. ***** &gt; The market will also watch Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&amp;J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus. ***** &gt; ’That’s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,” said Hogan. ***** &gt; Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. “As we go through the earnings season, what we’re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ***** &gt; UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends. ***** &gt; “As a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,” the UBS strategists wrote. “For now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.” ***** Krosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal. ***** “The market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,” she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations. ***** Eventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . “Are they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,” Krosby said. “That is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.” *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**  # **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**  *****  # Big Annual Declines Are Rare  &gt; Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.  &gt; “A positive year for the S&amp;P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,” noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. “We remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it’s just too early to tell.”  &gt; As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&amp;P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?  &gt; Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards—potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.  &gt; We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don’t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.  *****  # Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After  &gt; Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.  &gt; In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son’s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.  &gt; Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.  &gt; The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents’ Day. The S&amp;P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**  *****  # Gold Up, Dollar Down  &gt; For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**  &gt; With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**  *****  # All or Nothing Days on the Rise  &gt; We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&amp;P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.  &gt; All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**  &gt; Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&amp;P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**  *****  # Volatility Remains High  &gt; Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.  &gt; The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.  &gt; Over the last five weeks, the S&amp;P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&amp;P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**  &gt; Tuesday's rally also puts the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**  &gt; While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&amp;P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&amp;P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&amp;P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**  *****  # Semis Holding Up Relative to Market  &gt; In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&amp;P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.  &gt; From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&amp;P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**  *****  # Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders  &gt; Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**  &gt; As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, although its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$JPM**  &gt; * **$JNJ**  &gt; * **$RAD**  &gt; * **$BAC**  &gt; * **$WFC**  &gt; * **$UNH**  &gt; * **$CONN**  &gt; * **$C**  &gt; * **$APHA**  &gt; * **$FAST**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$GS**  &gt; * **$INFY**  &gt; * **$BBBY**  &gt; * **$TSM**  &gt; * **$BLK**  &gt; * **$PNC**  &gt; * **$CBSH**  &gt; * **$FRC**  &gt; * **$PGR**  &gt; * **$USB**  &gt; * **$AMRN**  &gt; * **$SLB**  &gt; * **$LAKE**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$LOVE**  &gt; * **$BK**  &gt; * **$JBHT**  &gt; * **$KEY**  &gt; * **$SON**  &gt; * **$WIT**  &gt; * **$KSU**  &gt; * **$BLX**  &gt; * **$STT**  &gt; * **$GHG**  &gt; * **$HOMB**  &gt; * **$MUSA**  &gt; * **$RF**  &gt; * **$BMI**  &gt; * **$WAFD**  &gt; * **$CFG**  &gt; * **$SRC**  &gt; * **$MRTN**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  &gt; # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png)) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png)) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $102.76 &gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on two companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:  https://preview.redd.it/v0obj5ffxyh41.png?width=2338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb986fbced13dc0118b0af6ae24c209004810c6  Global Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US and for IBM (and those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes not for consumers). They mostly focus on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the worlds largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earning on April 16th and option prices are ripe.

They'll be posting their January numbers on Feb 10th(from what I've heard).   During their last earnings call, they said their guidance for this quarter was around a 50% increase in sales. What got them down Jan 16, was their earnings to revunue ratio which was not as good as last year, and because of that it suffered the same fate as Facebook for their earnings.  Now this up to 50% increase in earnings is honestly beyond expectations. $TSM has factory production in China but said that they wouldn't be effected by the virus. So, although I have a high amount of calls in $TSM, I would like to say that this is not only something to buy calls for. But serves as a indicator. If Apple, Hauwei, and others cancelled orders from $TSM then it shows truly how bad the virus is and that we should be buying puts for Apple's likely dissapointing sales for this upcoming quarter. This should be reflected on $TSM's numbers. And if they truly hit a 50% increase in comparison to last year, hella buy calls for Apple, AMD, NVDA, and AMAT.

My 1 dollar calls went down to 0,8.   I reasoned buy the dip which i did so i doubled down. Problem was the sucker dropped further to 0,5 a contract. Next I quadrupeled down and bought some SPY calls. So luckily TSM and SPY went back up after that and i got back to +- 0 for the day.     Now imagine an announcment like ""tsm factory contaminated with coronavirus"". I would have been fucked.      Lesson of the story your fucked:     Lets look at the behavioual dd to this:   If you are actually making money your are fucked:     Gamblers conceit:  A fallacy where a gambler believes they will be able to stop a risky behavior while still engaging in it.

CPU TALK  \--------  Most cpu/graphics drivers are in fact not optimized for Nvdia/Intel contrary to popular opinion.  $AMD has made the last 2 generations of APUs(ps3,ps4,, xbox1) for consoles and now they're making the next gen ones also.  Most games are developed for consoles and optimized to perform well on consoles because of their custom OS; they are able to have access to the lower level hardware more efficiently than say a general purpose os like linux/windows.  For comparison, the only other manufacturer able to do this is $Apple because they make both their own hardware and software so the devices they make operate really well and smooth.  So what im driving at here is that most games are devloped with $AMD hardware in mind because most games also release on consoles, there are very few PC exclusives.  AMD will use their place as an industry leader to also promote the desktop gaming environment. Zen3 CPUS(RYZEN 4000) has now been leaked showing another 30% performance improvement over Zen2(Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series) CPUs on a 7nm+ node.   \--------  GPU TALK  \--------  I have speculated the big navi was coming early this year because 7nm nodes at TSMC($TSM) have now been shown to have above a 90% yield rate meaning for every 100 chip produced, 90 work. Samsung and Intel fabs have much lower yeilds. leaks show that Samsung 7nm is at 30% yeilds.([https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20](https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20))  Now we know for sure that big navi is coming and we are looking at more than 400mm\^2 die chips. The 5700xt die size is 252mm\^2; that means big navi has more than 2.5 times the die size as the 5700xt. Get ready for some serious performance out of AMD GPUs. Without yields being 90%+ on 7nm this would not be possible.  \--------------  FAB HOUSE TALK  \--------------  So now Apple, ARM, AMD, Nvidia, and now recently reveled Intel(for their dGPU - [https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)) are using $TSM's fab. TSM is fully booked for their 7nm process and now Apple is booking them for their 5nm node. AMD and TSM have a monopoly on their respective markets right now.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 13th, 2020.  # **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market’s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)** ***** &gt; The stock market’s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events — the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season. ***** &gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance. ***** &gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations. ***** &gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say. ***** &gt; “I think earnings are going to be a good component,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Companies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we’ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won’t be as bad as it could have been. It won’ be strong. We’ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.” ***** &gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not. ***** &gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran’s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823. ***** &gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions. ***** &gt; “If the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there’s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises” it could be negative, Arone said. “There’s skepticism already. If there’s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.” ***** &gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. “I think they’ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,” he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election. ***** &gt;# Economy &gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday. ***** &gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%. ***** &gt; “The holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas. ***** &gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed’s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday. ***** &gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. “It seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,” said LaVorgna. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CmRDJ3H.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HlaBE2S.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Mo3s1ZX.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4GkiL8Z.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wA851N3.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbY9KQS.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vGlTvp3.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v0Lf7h.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lm2IGKk.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YDrQkZN.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VzMB0Wn.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/V8ea808.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/HXQ4K2F.png))**  *****  # January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years  &gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500’s performance during January’s option expiration week has been a tepid.

However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500’s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%.

DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.  &gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fbda173e8dc370504a0f606427f62e1/ed8a77a7fe8ca133-e0/s540x810/8954d23b3dc93b4653c4fbb6e79bc909488fdeec.jpg))**  *****  # How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events  &gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.  &gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.  &gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we’ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.  &gt; “No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.”  &gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.  &gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/geopolitical-events-and-stock-market-reactions.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling  &gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.  &gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader’s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we’ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.  &gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn’t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; “Should you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don’t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.”  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year—like 2020—the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren’t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-first-five-days-of-2020-could-have-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # ""Take my crude, please""  &gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**  &gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-WTI-Declines.png))**  *****  # Dow 29,000?  &gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.  &gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-DJIA-29000.png))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 10th, 2020**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9wEbsG4rHc))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fim7EDbAptk))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$JPM**  &gt; * **$APHA**  &gt; * **$BAC**  &gt; * **$DAL**  &gt; * **$UNH**  &gt; * **$C**  &gt; * **$WFC**  &gt; * **$INFO**  &gt; * **$GS**  &gt; * **$BLK**  &gt; * **$PNC**  &gt; * **$FRC**  &gt; * **$USB**  &gt; * **$SLB**  &gt; * **$PPG**  &gt; * **$FAST**  &gt; * **$WIT**  &gt; * **$LMNR**  &gt; * **$KSU**  &gt; * **$TSM**  &gt; * **$WNS**  &gt; * **$SJR**  &gt; * **$AA**  &gt; * **$BK**  &gt; * **$CSX**  &gt; * **$MS**  &gt; * **$JBHT**  &gt; * **$HOMB**  &gt; * **$SCHW**  &gt; * **$RF**  &gt; * **$OGI**  &gt; * **$STT**  &gt; * **$BBCP**  &gt; * **$CFG**  &gt; * **$HWC**  &gt; * **$WAFD**  &gt; * **$PRGS**  &gt; * **$EGBN**  &gt; * **$OZK**  &gt; * **$BEDU**  &gt; * **$PBCT**  &gt; * **$FHN**  &gt; * **$INDB**  &gt; * **$VOLT**  &gt; * **$BMTC**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2sH0ItO.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/acnOb3c.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e3hO4am.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/duE2t8W.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I9iQ8f1.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQtl1r8.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lXhI0YM.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jpODGmg.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NYyWxgm.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJ8xHj2.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nsBUIFM.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $136.07 &gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Why do the index funds and ETFs seemingly have an impact on stocks that aren't even in it? I've been tracking $tsm for a little while and it seems that on days where spy is off, tsm also drops off a little even though tsm isn't in a particular fund that I can find. It's annoying that a stock that generally should be bullish loses on bear days.   Also why do companies follow the spy curve but spy doesn't follow the companies? Is it because there's a ton more volume in spy so any spy movement moves the stock? Does really good earnings in a singular stock have any impact on spy?

With Iran vowing a swift response, participants are cautious of further geopolitical escalation which could see these asset price movements continue, although desks are also cognizant of previous flares of conflict which have proved short-lived in regard to market reactions, such as the swift reversal of oil prices following the attacks of Saudi’s Abqaiq oil facility in September 2019.  #DOW  **Apple Inc.

Europe detail:**  **Asia**: Nikkei +0.3%, Hang Seng -0.8%, Shanghai -0.4%  Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region turned in some generally underwhelming performances on Wednesday, as the disappointing earnings report and outlook from Texas Instruments and the swirl of uncertainty surrounding Brexit left buyers in a guarded mood. There was also a lack of meaningful economic data to stir things up. In news, Beijing is reportedly looking into replacing Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, the IMF said growth in Asia in 2019 could slip to 5.0% from its prior forecast of 5.4%, and China, according to *Bloomberg*, is granting more waivers for buyers to step up purchases of U.S. soybeans.  * In economic data:    * Singapore September CPI +0.5% yr/yr (expected 0.5%; last 0.5%)  \---Equity Markets---  * **Japan's Nikkei:** \+0.3% * **Hong Kong's Hang Seng:** \-0.8% * **China's Shanghai Composite:** \-0.4% * **India's Sensex:** \+0.2% * **South Korea's Kospi:** \-0.4% * **Australia's ASX All Ordinaries:** unch  \---FX---  * USD/JPY: UNCH at 108.46 * USD/CNH: -0.04% to 7.0744 * USD/INR: +0.2% to 70.94  **Europe**: DAX +0.1%, FTSE +0.3%, CAC -0.6%  Major European indices have followed suit with their Asian counterparts and have thus far delivered an underwhelming performance. The drama surrounding the timeline for Brexit has kept investor conviction in check, along with an earnings warning out of Heineken. Disappointing quarterly results and guidance from both Texas Instruments and Caterpillar has the futures market presaging a negative start for the U.S. stock market, which has been another drag on sentiment.

The S&amp;P 500 futures are currently trading three points, or 0.1%, above fair value.   Specifically, China's Q3 GDP grew 6.0% yr/yr, which was down from 6.2% last quarter and less than the 6.1% expected growth figure. The GDP miss weighed on China's Shanghai Composite (-1.3%) on Friday, even though industrial production and retail sales for September did increase more than expected.   Back on the home front, the first big week of earnings season is wrapping up and results continue to come in mostly better than expected. Coca-Cola reported revenue that was just above expectations, and it slightly improved its revenue outlook. American Express beat earnings estimates and reported in-line revenue.   Today's economic data will be limited to the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.   U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

WTI crude is up 1.1%, or $0.57, to $54.50/bbl.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Coca-Cola** (KO 54.45, +0.66): +1.2% after reporting in-line results and slightly improving its revenue outlook.  * **American Express** (AXP 120.90, +1.80): +1.5% after beating earnings estimates and reported in-line revenue.  * **Schlumberger** (SLB 32.45, +0.56): +1.8% after beating earnings estimates.  * **Macy's** (M 15.06, -0.72): -4.9% after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock, as well as **Gap** (GPS 16.81, -0.76, -4.3%) and **L Brands** (LB 17.23, -0.87, -4.8%), to Underperform from Neutral.   Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the week on a mostly lower note. Japan's Nikkei +0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite -1.3%, India's Sensex +0.6%, South Korea's Kospi -0.8%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.    * In economic data:       * China's Q3 GDP +1.5% qtr/qtr, as expected (last 1.6%); +6.0% yr/yr (expected 6.1%; last 6.2%).

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.   **Bank of America** (**BAC** 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. **United Airlines** (**UAL** 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.   For instance, China warned it would take ""strong countermeasures"" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.  On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

Friday's announcement about a partial trade deal being reached with China invited speculation about how much was really accomplished. To that point, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are not willing to sign the ""phase one"" deal without more discussions. President Trump, however, has already pushed back, saying that China will immediately increase its purchases of agricultural products from the U.S. and that the phase one deal can be finalized and signed soon.  Markets in Europe trade in negative territory, pressured in part by renewed concerns about the likelihood of a Brexit deal being reached.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 14th, 2019.  # **Profits expected to fall as earnings season kicks off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/profits-expected-to-fall-as-earnings-season-kicks-off-in-the-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; The third-quarter earnings season kicks off in the coming week, and it is likely to expose how much the trade war has cost companies’ bottom lines. ***** &gt; First out of the gate are major banks and financial companies, with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs reporting Tuesday. But by the end of the week, a smattering of industrial, tech, transportation and consumer names will have reported, including Alcoa and Honeywell. Netflix and IBM report Wednesday, and consumer giant Coca-Cola reports Friday. United Airlines reports Tuesday, and CSX reports Wednesday. ***** &gt; Besides earnings, some important economic reports are being released, including retail sales on Wednesday and industrial production Thursday. ***** &gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to decline by 3.1% for the third quarter, after growing by more than 3% in the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. For the second quarter, earnings were also expected to be negative to flat, but results beat lowered expectations. ***** &gt; “The story of are we going to be negative, or are we not going to be negative, is going to be in focus,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ***** &gt; Palfrey said margins are being pinched in several areas, including energy, with the decline in oil prices. Oil has been responding more to worries about global growth and trade wars than to geopolitical developments that normally could drive it higher. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 7.5% in the third quarter. ***** &gt; “We are of the view that companies will likely devote a significant portion of their time talking about the impact of trade tariffs,” Palfrey said. “The goal is to ascertain just how much the decline in earnings is coming from those pressures.” ***** &gt; The decline in oil prices, in fact, are expected to drag down profits in the energy sector. Earnings for the energy sector are expected to be down 32%, while revenues are expected to fall by 9.5%, according to Credit Suisse. Margins for the sector are expected to contract by 22.7%. Without energy estimates included, S&amp;P profits would be down just 1%, according to Refinitiv. ***** &gt; “We think margins are going to subtract 5.9% from EPS growth of the S&amp;P 500,” said Palfrey. He projects earnings overall to decline by 4.2%, and he does not expect the stock market to make much headway during the earnings season. ***** &gt; “I think we’re moving sideways. The real backstop is the environment, while under pressure, it is nonrecessionary, and that will ultimately prevent the market from materially selling off,” said Palfrey. ***** &gt; Palflrey said a group he calls “tech plus,” which include tech and communications companies, have taken some of the biggest margin hits this quarter even though revenue growth remains solid. Six of the top 10 companies whose margins impacted S&amp;P earnings growth the most are from that group, including Alphabet , Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Micron. ***** &gt; As a group, their margins are expected to contract by 14.8%, compared with 3.6% for all other S&amp;P 500 companies combined. ***** &gt; ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum are on the list of companies with the biggest margin hits. Exxon for example saw a decline in margins of 34%, and Credit Suisse estimates that pared 0.6% off overall S&amp;P 500 earnings growth. Credit Suisse says the consensus decline in Amazon margins is expected to be 42.5%, denting S&amp;P earnings growth by 0.3%. ***** &gt; “At least for earnings, it’s a relatively positive backdrop. We should see a little bit of clarity on the whole China trade,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. Hickey said in the past two quarters, stocks did well at the start of the reporting season, but they were then derailed by trade developments in the latter part of the earnings period. ***** &gt; Palfrey said the market is being held back by several factors, including the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. “I think it’s going to be difficult for the market to move meaningfully higher without an improvement in industrial data and without the yield curve becoming uninverted,” he said. ***** &gt; ISM manufacturing data has been weakening and has shown a contraction in activity for the past two months. ***** &gt; The inverted yield curve is a bond market recession warning. When the curve is inverted, shorter duration securities yield more than longer duration securities, meaning investors are demanding a higher yield to hold investments for a much briefer time. In this case, the 3-month Treasury bill was yielding about 11 more basis points than the 10-year note. ***** &gt; Hickey said there could be some positives in the earnings season, like last quarter. Negative revisions of earnings estimates by analysts are outnumbering positive revisions by about 2 to 1. He noted in the last two quarters, stocks responded well to earnings news in the beginning of the reporting period but then faded when negative headlines on trade in the latter part of each earnings season. ***** &gt; “Expectations seem pretty low. We’ve had analysts’ downward revisions remain elevated, as they’ve been heading into prior warning seasons. But we haven’t necessarily seen the number of warnings from companies rising,” he said. “It could be a positive divergence that analysts are lowering earnings estimates at a higher-than-average rate, but companies aren’t warning at a higher-than-average rate.” ***** &gt; Financial companies profits are expected to be up by 1.4%, and real estate is expected to see the best profit growth with a gain of 2.7%, according to Refinitiv. The information technology sector is expected to see a profit decline of 7.6%, and communications is expected to be 1% lower, according to Refinitiv. Materials is expected to see the biggest decline after energy. Sensitive to global growth and manufacturing, the sector’s earnings are expected to fall 11.1%. ***** &gt; Despite the downbeat expectations for third-quarter earnings, companies may issue more positive outlooks after China and the U.S. announced the first phase of a trade deal. ***** &gt; Stocks rallied Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all up more than 1%. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were also up around 1% for the week and snapped a three-week losing streak. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7ALiiKS.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6paUBRf.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZzHQ7gY.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/fMJp9b0.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/M04OsLr.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/njFewAJ.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0T6SRMQ.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AwWDCTj.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aba1Nd2.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kVovSfR.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eoOlkPy.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WaIYNyh.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Rgqt18G.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/EGocLGS.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/11/19  &gt; It was a disappointing week for US economic data as two-thirds of releases came in weaker than expected or than the prior period. Consumer Credit data for the month of August was the only major release on Monday, exceeding expectations, but declining from July’s level. Inflation data took the spotlight this week with the release of PPI, CPI, and export and import prices. Core CPI was inline with the previous month and the import price index’s decline (year over year) was smaller than forecasted, but other readings on inflation were weaker. Likewise, labor data had its share of disappointments as the JOLTS report showed a third consecutive decline in openings, hourly earnings growth slowed, and continuing claims ticked higher. Initial Jobless Claims provided some relief though, coming in at 210K compared to 220K expected and 219K last week. While small business optimism was weaker—NFIB’s index fell to 101.8 from 103.1—consumer sentiment readings from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan both rose with the latter exceeding expectations.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO1.png))**  &gt; Looking ahead to next week, the calendar is slightly busier with 22 releases on the docket in addition to earnings beginning to ramp up as a total of 115 companies report. There are no scheduled economic releases Monday due to Columbus Day, so next week’s data begins on Tuesday with Empire Manufacturing which is forecasted to fall from 2.0 to 0.5. Other manufacturing gauges, including the Philadelphia Fed’s index and industrial production, are also expected to fall. Retail Sales is scheduled for Wednesday and are expected to rise 0.3%. On Thursday, Housing Starts and Permit data are both expected to show moderation. The leading index is scheduled to round out the week on Friday.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO2.png))**  *****  # Fund Flows Favor Fixed Income  &gt; This week’s fund flow numbers from the Investment Company Institute showed that the long, steady rotation from equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds to fixed income funds has continued.  &gt; As shown below, the spread between equity fund flows and fixed income fund flows has reached a net reading of -$165.9bn over the last three months; that’s among the largest net flow out of equities and into bonds since the data starts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-Flows-1.png))**  &gt; Fixed income isn’t the only place that retail has been moving allocations to. As shown in the chart below, 13 week commodity fund flows have been among the largest of the periods since the data for ETF and mutual funds combined begins.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-Flows-2.png))**  *****  # The Most Volatile Stocks on Earnings  &gt; Looking for action? At the start of each earnings season, we publish our list of the most volatile stocks on earnings. Our Earnings Explorer tool contains a huge database that has every single quarterly earnings report for nearly all US-listed stocks going back to 2001. One part of the database tracks the one-day price reaction that stocks experience following their earnings reports, so users are able to easily track how individual stocks typically react to earnings.  &gt; In the table below, we show the stocks expected to report within the next month that have historically been the most volatile in reaction to earnings. To make the list, the company had to have at least 20 quarterly reports (5 years) and also have a current share price of $5 or more.  &gt; At the top of the list is Telecom equipment maker Infinera (INFN), which is scheduled to report on October 28th after the close. INFN just barely makes the cut because it trades at $5.20/share, but it has historically averaged a one-day absolute change of 15.16% on its historical earnings reaction days. You can expect a big move when it reports at the end of this month. Consumer review website YELP ranks as the second most volatile stock on earnings with an average one-day move of +/-14.85%. Enphase Energy (ENPH), LendingTree (TREE), and Applied Opto (AAOI) round out the top five with average one-day moves of more than +/-13% on their earnings reaction days. Other notables towards the top of the list include Wayfair (W), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR), which all typically move either up or down more than 12% on earnings.  &gt; Of the stocks on the list, Enphase (ENPH) is up by far the most in 2019 with a huge gain of 424%. Other stocks like Stamps.com (STMP), ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), and Green Dot (GDOT) are down more than 50% YTD. Twitter (TWTR), Blucora (BCOR), and Benefitfocus (BNFT) have the highest earnings beat rates at more than 90%. While it has a high beat rate, BNFT has been on a wild ride over the past two years, rallying from $24 up to $60 in 2018 before falling all the way back down to $24 as of today. You can bet a big move is in store when it reports on the 31st.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/allvol.png))**  &gt; If you're just interested in large-cap names, below is a list of the most volatile S&amp;P 500 stocks on earnings. These are stocks set to report over the next month, and as shown, Netflix (NFLX) is at the top of the list with an average one-day move of +/-12.78% on earnings. Twitter (TWTR), Align Tech (ALGN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Akamai (AKAM) rank 2nd through 5th in that order, while other notables include Amazon (AMZN), Advanced Micro (AMD), Chipotle (CMG), Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).  &gt; If you own or have interest in owning any of these names, buckle up because they're likely to experience a big move when they report at some point in the next few weeks!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxvol.png))**  *****  # Key Earnings Reports Over the Next Two Weeks  &gt; Our Earnings Calendar is part of our Earnings Explorer tool. The calendar shows the upcoming earnings report dates for US-listed companies over the next month, and investors use it as an easy way to monitor the names they're most interested in. We provide quite a bit of information for each company listed in the calendar, including EPS and sales estimates, its historical beat rates, and its average share price performance on its earnings reaction day. If you ever want to know how a stock typically trades in reaction to its earnings report, this is the place to go.  &gt; The Q3 2019 earnings reporting period finally kicks off next week when most of the big banks are set to report. But the biggest weeks for earnings will come in the back half of October and the first couple weeks of November. As shown in the chart below, the week of October 28th through November 1st is the busiest of them all when we'll see hundreds of companies report each day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/calen.png))**  &gt; Below is a list pulled from our Earnings Calendar of the key earnings reports to watch next week (based on market cap). There are no key reports to speak of on Monday the 14th due to Columbus Day, but on Tuesday we'll hear from Citigroup (C), Goldman (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) all before the open. On Wednesday, we'll get results from Bank of America (BAC) in the morning and then IBM and Netflix (NFLX) after the close, while on Thursday we'll hear from Morgan Stanley (MS), which will be the last of the major banks and brokers to report next week. American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Schlumberger (SLB) will finish off the week with reports on Friday morning.  &gt; Of the key stocks reporting next week, Goldman (GS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) beat EPS estimates the most often at more than 90% of the time. In terms of price reactions, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- which reports on Thursday afternoon -- has historically reacted the most positively to earnings with an average one-day gain of 3.24%. Bank of America (BAC) has the weakest price reaction to earnings with an average one-day drop of 0.95%.  &gt; In terms of earnings volatility, Netflix (NFLX) takes the cake with an average absolute one-day change of 12.78% on its earnings reaction day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key-reports-next-week-use.png))**  &gt; The following week (10/21-10/25) is when we'll really be in the heart of the Q3 reporting period. A large number of Dow 30 stocks will report that week, including big blue chips like McDonald's (MCD), United Tech (UTX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT). The most important report of the week will come on Thursday the 24th when Amazon (AMZN) announces after the close. AMZN is currently expected to announce earnings of $7.19/share and revenues of $68.7 billion for the quarter. AMZN doesn't have an abnormally high EPS beat rate at just 62.5%, but it is typically a very volatile name as its average one-day move on earnings has historically been nearly +/-10%. Just think, a 10% move for AMZN is a $174 swing in either direction based on its current share price.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key10211025.png))**  *****  # Is October Really Scary?  &gt; Just like that, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell more than 1% on the first day of October. The rough start has many investors on edge, as October is known for spectacular crashes—specifically 1929, 1987, and 2008.  &gt; On the flipside, September 2019 was historically calm for equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 didn’t fall 1% on a single day the entire month.  &gt; “The lack of any volatility in September could mean the usually volatile month of October could be due for some big swings,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news, though, is while October has had a bad rap for some big drops, over the past 20 years, it actually has been the third best month of the year for stocks.”  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, October has quietly been one of the strongest months of the year over the past 10 and 20 years. Going back to 1950, it ranks as the seventh strongest month of the year, so right near the middle of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/october-stocks_2019.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Four other things to consider: Since 1950, no month has had more 1% moves (higher or lower) than October. Since 1928, 6 of the 10 worst single-day drops have taken place in October; however, 3 of the 10 best days ever occurred in October as well. This is a pre-election year, and as the chart above shows, October’s average returns in a pre-election year have been muted since 1950. The catch here is that this average return is greatly impacted by the 21.8% drop in 1987. The median return is actually quite respectable. October has been higher during a pre-election year every year since 1999, with an average return of an impressive 6.5%.  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 11th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYXkkUWqnQ))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.13.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFd5cGe31do))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$NFLX**  &gt; * **$JPM**  &gt; * **$UNH**  &gt; * **$C**  &gt; * **$BAC**  &gt; * **$JNJ**  &gt; * **$GS**  &gt; * **$WFC**  &gt; * **$APHA**  &gt; * **$SCHW**  &gt; * **$ALLY**  &gt; * **$ABT**  &gt; * **$BLK**  &gt; * **$KO**  &gt; * **$PLD**  &gt; * **$UAL**  &gt; * **$PM**  &gt; * **$WIT**  &gt; * **$MS**  &gt; * **$IBM**  &gt; * **$AXP**  &gt; * **$FHN**  &gt; * **$FRC**  &gt; * **$URI**  &gt; * **$SLB**  &gt; * **$HON**  &gt; * **$CSX**  &gt; * **$PNC**  &gt; * **$UNP**  &gt; * **$TEAM**  &gt; * **$AA**  &gt; * **$USB**  &gt; * **$ISRG**  &gt; * **$ERIC**  &gt; * **$CCI**  &gt; * **$BK**  &gt; * **$ASML**  &gt; * **$JBHT**  &gt; * **$CMA**  &gt; * **$TSM**  &gt; * **$TXT**  &gt; * **$SNBR**  &gt; * **$BBT**  &gt; * **$MBWM**  &gt; * **$GPC**  &gt; * **$KMI**  &gt; * **$KEY**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aba1Nd2.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PuhtXaX.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/YRRM2LU.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 10.14.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  &gt; # ***Monday 10.14.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]()) NONE.  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 10.15.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/MJWa86V.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 10.15.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zu9Ow0t.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 10.16.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/eam8p95.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 10.16.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/KOCx48P.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 10.17.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/R3sTSi2.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 10.17.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/blMe0PL.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 10.18.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8WY2fuA.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 10.18.19 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # Netflix, Inc. $282.93 &gt; **Netflix, Inc.

Beijing would offer to buy more agricultural products in exchange without addressing any structural trade issues. The *Financial Times* reported that soybean purchases could increase by 10 million tons annually.   Walking out of the 13th round of trade talks without resolving any core issues and keeping tariff rates unchanged seems underwhelming compared to the complete deal that President Trump has been wanting. Nevertheless, there was some angst yesterday about those tariff-rate hikes taking effect this year.  Today's economic calendar will feature the minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET. Wholesale Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) and the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for August will precede the minutes at 10:00 a.m. ET.   U.S. Treasuries have ticked lower this morning, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 99.05. WTI crude is up 1.0%, or $0.53, to $53.16/bbl.

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.  For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.  At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to **Apple's** (**AAPL** 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it is expected to unveil its latest iPhone.   In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.  U.S. Treasuries are slightly lower, nudging yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.45. WTI crude is up 1.0% to $58.42/bbl, which could continue to benefit the oil-sensitive energy stocks that have bounced back this month.   In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Apple** (AAPL 213.73, -0.44): -0.2% ahead of its annual Special Event at 1:00 p.m. ET.  * **Wendy's** (WEN 20.00, -1.95): -8.9% after lowering its earnings guidance to reflect costs incurred to launch a breakfast menu in 2020.  * **Ford Motor** (F 9.19, -0.35): -3.7% after Moody's downgraded its senior unsecured rating to Ba1, or ""junk rating,"" from Baa3.   Reviewing overnight developments:  * Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. Japan's Nikkei +0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng UNCH, China's Shanghai Composite -0.1%, India's Sensex Closed for Moharram, South Korea's Kospi +0.6%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.    * In economic data:       * China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

I'll be hoping off AMD this Monday at 27.50 for a profit of something like $100-150. I'll then wait for the tech market to bottom out (rip bulls lmao xddd)   Once everything is low I'll buy back an equal equity in NVDA, AMD, and TSM.

After losing 18k last year, I put in $350 in my RH account last week to play with all the crazy news coming out recently. Short $SWKS:  1. Apple lowered guidance yesterday, cutting growth for the first time ever and citing weak sales in China. Also there is economic slowdown in China, and this whole trade war thing is really fucking Chinese companies.  2. Shorting APPL is dumb. Everybody and their mother saw last nights news and the dip, and is thinking to short APPL. But APPL is still a good business and Buffet wants to buy more. I think it’s dip will be smaller. So how can you profit off of this news? Short Apple’s suppliers.  3. Here are a few of Apples suppliers: $SWKS $TSM $QRVO. In a mad frenzy I researched the shit out of these companies last night. All of them get a ton of business from Apple - you can look up the exact numbers but it was something like 40%, 30%, 20% respectively.  4. Apple suppliers are getting fucked from lowering smartphone sales. All of those companies are down over 10% in the past month and some are down much more.  5. Why $SWKS? [Skyworks gets 40% of its business from Apple.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2017/09/18/how-skyworks-solutions-makes-most-of-its-money.aspx) That’s a huge amount - even more than the other suppliers. Analysts with a sell rating cite the risks of how much the company relies on Apple. Also, I was looking through posts in this sub and came across [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9e5ufu/thinking_about_swks_puts/?st=JQGQV8BS&amp;sh=781c505b) 86% of Skyworks’ revenue is from China. This was the number one company on this trade war short list, and the fact that smartphone sales/Apple sales in China are dipping will kill the company’s prospects.  6. I’m all in on $SWKS cause I have no money in my RH account after losing everything last year. I was planning to diversify among the 3 suppliers I picked but as soon as the markets opened all of the contracts I was looking at doubled in price. My plan was that if I couldn’t afford contracts on each ticker, SWKS was the one I’d go all in on. [I have 2 contracts expiring this month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9e5ufu/thinking_about_swks_puts/?st=JQGQV8BS&amp;sh=781c505b)  Is it too late to get in on this play? Well, $SWKS is already down 7% as I’m writing this with the other tickers not looking so hot either. I’m up 50% in 30 minutes on my positions. I think that these have a ways to continue down, but to be safe I would buy puts that expire in feburary (i.e. this might bounce back in the short term but I believe they will continue to drop at least for the next few months). Another risk is that China and the US come to some agreement that helps these stocks. I think it is very unlikely to happen, at least for a month or two as Trump battles the democrats and the incoming gridlock in congress. He is unpredictable but I don’t think he is smart enough to deal with China while whining about border funding. Also - Apple is being boycotted in China because of the Huawei executive arrest. Even if the trade war is resolved I think Apple is screwed in China for the forseeable future.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|457766.0|public|confidence|self|||Short $SWKS (Apple supplier)||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ac6md8/short_swks_apple_supplier/|house_only|1.0||||||||||||||||||2019-01-03|TSM

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) [are Applied Materials’s major customers](http://marketrealist.com/2015/01/applied-materials-detailed-business-overview/), contributing about 30% of their revenue. Intel (INTC) is also a key customer.  Look back at each of these companies last ERs and you'll see they're all killing it - beats on top &amp; bottom with *raised guidance*.  Where is a part of that raised guidance business going to?  **AMAT.**  Now here's where the legit DD comes in, [peep this report from ICInsights released yesterday](http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Will-Samsungs-2017-Semi-Capex-Deliver-Knockout-Blow-To-Competition/)  'IC Insights’ latest forecast now shows semiconductor industry capital spending climbing 35% this year to $90.8 billion.  After spending $11.3 billion in semiconductor capex last year, Samsung announced that its 2017 *outlays for the semiconductor group are expected to more than double to $26 billion.'*  **'Bill McClean, president of IC Insights stated, “In my 37 years of tracking the semiconductor industry, I have never seen such an aggressive ramp of semiconductor capital expenditures.  The sheer magnitude of Samsung’s spending this year is unprecedented in the history of the semiconductor industry!”'**  I sold out of my Nintendo holding after the 4% pop this morning, lowered my stake in Micron, and used the funds to go balls deep in AMAT's ER.

US futures are up small. Nothing major occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT (http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers (both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be important too.    * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb (8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC, VRNT after the close).    * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP. Treasuries are pretty flat.    * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks, media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.    * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan (TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China (SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI +0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%, Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77% vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%.  #US macro update    * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18 EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs (Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which starts Thurs morning 4/13).  #Top Headlines for Tuesday    * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels “burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v    * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 – “tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK    * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15% corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are talking about &gt;20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV    * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy    * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8    * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget; Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO    * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ    * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment – the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f    * Company-specific news update from Tues morning. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.    * Company-specific news update from Mon night. RHT’s results were strong, esp. the blowout billings number for the Feb-end Q. SNX also was solid (better Feb-end results and inline earnings). DRI reported earnings ahead of the St and announced plans to buy Cheddar’s for $780MM in cash. Red Mountain sent a letter to DECK’s board and called on the co to explore strategic alternatives. HOMB announced plans to buy SGBK. ALXN named a new CEO.     * China/semiconductors – Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest chipmaker, has secured ~$22B in financing to pursue M&amp;A and build production capacity. Unigroup is in the process of building a massive ~$30B memory plant. China in total plans to spend $150B over the next 10 years to secure a leading position in the global semi industry. Bloomberg. http://bloom.bg/2otzBvd    * CMCSA – the co is planning to rebrand and expand its streaming TV product. The new service, which will be marked as Xfinity Instant TV, will cost $15-40/month and will be made available to the &gt;50MM homes within the CMCSA footprint. Reuters. http://cnb.cx/2o1b4RC    * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as “Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb    * Italy – despite all the anxiety around Thy God-Emperor Trump and France, the market’s biggest political risk is still Italy. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ndmKgq    * Iranian oil minister says global oil cuts deal likely to be extended – Reuters http://reut.rs/2mLA8fu   * Bank lending update from JPM’s D Silver - commercial bank lending has cooled notably in recent months. Bank lending often weakens around recessions, and there has been some concern over the recent slowing. But there are also a few instances in which bank lending firmed again after a mid-expansion moderation, and we are not especially alarmed by the recent slowing in the data. Given many signs that business investment has strengthened more recently, we think the bank lending data will eventually firm. http://bit.ly/2o16zXg   * Wall St research – Reuters discusses the “period of turmoil” facing the research industry due to upcoming regulatory changes. Online research portals could gain share at the expense of “bulge bracket” investment banks. According to one study, ~40K research reports are produced every week by the world’s top 15 global investment banks but only 1% are actually consumed by clients. Reuters http://reut.rs/2oc0Riq  #Washington – what comes next?   * The next major issue to be addressed in Washington concerns the budget as the present spending authorization is due to expire on Apr 28 – failure to sign a new budget (or a Continuing Resolution) by that date could result in a “shutdown”. A shutdown on its own wouldn’t be a major headache for stocks or the economy although at this time on gov’t stoppage would probably have negative consequences as it 1) would reinforce the message sent by the ACHA failure of Washington being hopelessly deadlocked and 2) raise doubts about Washington acting smoothly on the debt ceiling (the debt ceiling probably doesn’t have to be raised until later in the summer or early fall).    * On taxes, the GOP is aggressively pivoting but there is a lot of work left to do. The Ryan/Brady BAT bill is the only tax legislation that actually exists but (as has the case for months) this bill can’t pass the Senate; if Ryan insists on commencing the tax debate w/his BAT blueprint as the base case that could cause months of contentious negotiations and drag the process into the fall at least (Brady’s House Ways and Means Committee has a meeting Tues 3/28 at which it will discuss taxes). Thy God-Emperor Trump will play a big role – the White House largely outsourced healthcare to Ryan but by getting involved early w/taxes it could help steer the process towards a bill capable of passing both the House and Senate.    * Without BATs and the ACHA savings it will be very difficult for any tax legislation to be “revenue neutral” which means the GOP will have to 1) secure some Democratic support in the Senate to overcome a likely filibuster or 2) sunset any changes after 10 years (like the George W Bush tax cuts). Erstwhile GOP deficit hawks seem a bit more amenable to unfinanced tax cuts (Meadows, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, this weekend said taxes don’t have to be revenue neutral) but they are unlikely to countenance enormous deficits.      * The market right now assumes the corporate rate can be cut to ~25% (or lower) when all is said and done – anything higher than that number is likely to underwhelm. The “easiest” bill to pass would likely be some combination of a repatriation holiday and infrastructure spending (this is likely going to be the fallback solution if taxes stay deadlocked into the late fall) although passing either alone would likely foreclose the possibility of broader tax action. Markets appreciate that tax reform won’t happen by Aug and most don’t even think it can happen this year. However, investors are hoping to see a credible and passable blueprint by the fall that can get to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk by early 2018.  #Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Mar 27    * There aren’t many major events scheduled this week other than some eco data (the most important of which will likely be the US Feb PCE on Fri 3/31) and a few earnings reports.    * Calendar for Wed 3/29 – the focus will be on the UK triggering of Article 50, US pending home sales for Feb (10amET), some Fed speakers (Evans, Rosengren, and Williams), some analyst meetings (ALK, DXC), the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch (in NYC), and earnings (PAYX, SCWX, UNF pre-open and LULU and WOR after the close).    * Calendar for Thurs 3/30 – the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Mester, Kaplan, Dudley, and Williams), analyst meetings (AKAM, TECK), and earnings (SAIC pre-open).    * Calendar for Fri 3/31 – the focus will be on China’s NBS manufacturing and nonmanufacturing PMIs for Mar (out Thurs night/Fri morning), the Eurozone CPI for Mar (5amET), the US personal income/spending/PCE for Feb (8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for Mar (9:45amET), Michigan confidence numbers for Mar (10amET), and earnings (BBRY preopen).  #Catalysts for 2017  – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be added)    * Article 50/UK – PM May is planning to trigger Article 50 on Wed Mar 29.    * WFC’s “living will” – WFC will resubmit its living will in the Mar timeframe. Normally this wouldn’t be a major event but if WFC’s living will is deemed inadequate again the Fed could raise the company’s capital requirements.    * French debate – the second French presidential debate is Apr 4.    * Fed minutes – minutes from the 3/15 meeting due out Wed 4/5 (2pmET)    * Bank stress tests – US bank stress tests to be submitted to regulators by Apr 5    * ECB minutes – minutes from the 3/9 meeting due out Thurs 4/6    * Thy God-Emperor Trump to host China's Xi at Mar-a-Lago Apr 6-7    * US jobs report for Mar – Fri 4/7.    * Greece – Eurozone fin min meeting Apr 7-8 (Greece hopes to have a deal in place by this meeting)    * Q1 earnings – Thurs 4/13 is the first busy day of the CQ1 season. The heaviest volume begins during the week of Mon 4/24.    * Turkey referendum – Apr 16    * China Mar retail sales/IP/FAI and Q1 GDP – Mon morning 4/17    * French debate – the third French presidential debate is Apr 20.    * France first-round presidential election Apr 23 (run-off is May 7).    * US Treasury publishes semi-annual currency report will be published around the Apr timeframe (investors will watch China’s designation closely to see if it gets labeled a currency manipulator).    * US gov’t funding – current spending legislation will keep the gov’t funded until Apr 28    * EU/UK – EU Leaders to meet for special Brexit summit on Apr 29.    * Europe/Russia - Merkel will visit Moscow for talks on May 2     * Fed meeting – decision out Wed 5/3    * French election round two – Sun May 7    * Obama will make his first major post-presidential speech Sun May 7 (he will be awarded the JFK Profile in Courage Award on that day).    * Thy God-Emperor Trump travel ban - a court will begin considering Thy God-Emperor Trump’s travel ban on May 8    * South Korea elections – South Korea will hold presidential elections May 9.    * Thy God-Emperor Trump budget – his full budget (including taxes, infrastructure, and entitlements) will be published in May.    * OPEC – the next formal OPEC summit is May 25    * NATO summit – NATO will hold a summit May 25; Montenegro is expected to become a NATO member at this event; Thy God-Emperor Trump will attend.    * G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.    * US financial regulatory review – the Treasury will present recommendations to Thy God-Emperor Trump around the end of May/start of June on ways to ease financial regulations.    * Italy – new elections could take place in the June timeframe (although the odds of this happening have receded). If elections aren’t held in June, the next possible date would be late Sept (according to Reuters).    * Fed meeting – decision out Wed 6/14    * French parliamentary elections – June 18    * OPEC – the current OPEC supply agreement is due to expire at the end of June.    * Russia – European sanctions against Russia are due to expire in June.    * China/MSCI - MSCI will announce the result of the China A shares inclusion proposal as part of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.    * US bank stress tests – the Fed will publish bank stress test results in June.    * G20 Leaders Summit Jul 7-8 2017 in Germany.    * Greece – the country faces a bond maturity on Jul 17.    * ECB meeting/press conf. Jul 20 – the ECB has said it will discuss potential bond tapering around the middle of 2017.    * Fed meeting – decision out Wed 7/26    * German elections – the next German elections will be held between Aug and Oct 2017.    * Chinese politics – China’s 19th National Congress will take place in the fall of 2017 and will set the country’s political path for the next five years.  #US – healthcare    * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy    * Paul Ryan says House Republicans will continue their push for healthcare reform this year – Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2ndt87a    * Healthcare/taxes – Republicans won’t look to repeal ACA taxes as part of tax reform – Reuters http://reut.rs/2nZthz4  #US – fiscal policy    * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels “burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v    * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 – “tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK    * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15% corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are talking about &gt;20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV    * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget; Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO    * US gov't shutdown risks not appreciated by markets – Axios update (this was out Mon morning) - ""A top Republican with close ties to the White House tells me that after the GOP failure on healthcare, a government shutdown — looming when a continuing resolution runs out April 28 — is ""more likely than not... Wall Street is not expecting a shutdown and the markets are unprepared"" - http://bit.ly/2nmX9CB  #US – economic growth, monetary policy    * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as “Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb    * States expect tax revenue to grow at a slower clip going forward than in the decades preceding the financial crisis. The average state assumes income tax revenue growth of 3.6% in F17 (down from +4% last year) w/sales tax +3.1% (down from +4.2%).

Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8    * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ      * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment, the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by automation and increased nat. gas demand.

Morgan Early Look at the Market – Fri 1.13.17  Trading Desk Commentary; For Institutional Investors Only  **PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD THIS DOCUMENT**  #Morning Levels •   US futures are up 3-4 points  •   Asia: Japan Nikkei +0.80%, Japan TOPIX +0.62%, China -0.21%, Hong Kong +0.47%, KOSPI - 0.50%, Taiwan -0.33%, Australia -0.79%  •   EuroStoxx 50 +0.78%, FTSE +0.37%, DAX +0.60%, CAC +0.85%, Italy +1.18%, Spain +0.76%  •   USD (DXY) down 0.14%, EUR up 0.32%, GBP up 0.49%, JPY up 0.03%, CNY Onshore down 0.07%, CNH Offshore up 0.14%, AUD up 0.07%  •   VIX down 0.87% to 11.44  •   Gold up 0.14% to $1,197.11  •   Silver down 0.09% to $16.81  •   Copper down 0.75% to $265.15  •   WTI Crude down 1.04% to $52.46  •   Brent Crude down 1.21% to $55.33  •   Natural Gas down 0.21% to $3.38  •   Corn down 0.28% to $3.57/bu  •   Wheat unch at $426.25  •   Treasuries 2yr yields are down ~0.9bps at 1.165%, 10yr yields are down ~1.6bps at 2.347% and 30yr yields are down ~1.1bps at 2.949%  •   Japan 10yr yields 0.039%, up ~0.9bps on the day  •   France 10yr yields 0.776%, up ~0.5bps on the day  •   Italy 10yr yields 1.898%, up ~0.8bps on the day   •   Spain 10yr yields 1.405%, up ~0.7bps on the day  •   Germany 10yr yields 0.309%, up ~0.2bps on the day   #Trading Update  •   Market update – once again, there isn’t much to talk about overnight. China’s trade numbers were the big macro headline but those figures are hardly changing the broader macro narrative (exports fell slightly short while imports were inline). Otherwise the wires were largely void of major headlines. Asia was mixed, Eurozone stocks are rallying nicely (although are on track to end the week lower), and US futures are up a few points.  •   Calendar - for Friday investors will be watching US Dec PPI/retail sales (8:30amET), US Michigan confidence for Jan (10amET), one Fed speaker (Harker), and earnings (BAC, BLK, FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC pre-open).  •   Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are seeing solid gains (up ~60-70bp). Most major sub-groups are trading higher but tech, fin services, banks, media, and healthcare are outperforming. Fiat Chrysler is rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less severe than the one that hit VW although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe into its emissions. Technicolor is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.    •   FX – the DXY is in the red again so far Fri morning (the DXY is tracking for a ~1% dip this week). The USD is weak vs. the GBP and EUR and is flattish against the JPY. Investors are looking forward to the Brexit speech on Tues from PM May.  •   Asia – the major Asian bourses were mixed: Japan (TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.8%), HK (Hang Seng +0.47%, HSCEI +0.66%), mainland China (SHCOMP -0.21%, Shenzhen -1.55%), Korea (KOSPI - 0.5%), Australia (ASX 200 -0.79%), and India (flattish for the major indices). China’s trade numbers were the big headline out of Asia (exports were a touch light while imports were inline). The Bank of Korea decision was largely consistent w/expectations. In India, INFY and TCS are both trading lower despite OK earnings from both. Taiwan didn’t trade very badly despite the underwhelming TSMC guidance.  •   Japan – it was an extremely quiet and relatively uneventful trading session. Focus has begun to turn to earnings with Retail +2.3% bouncing from recent weakness following Fast Retailing +1.1% and Seven&amp;i +8.6% earnings beat. Downside was led by Nintendo -5.8%, trading close to 10% of total TPX turnover, as its 'Switch' presentation failed to impress - especially with their $299.99 pricing (street was modeling more around $250~$275). Otherwise, dispersion across sectors was low and larger moves were driven more by microheadlines: Takata traded at limit high (+16.47%) after headlines saying the co and the US Justice Department may announce a settlement as soon as Fri over air bags, SMM -4.7% got hit after Nickel's weakness overnight, while Screen -4.0% traded lower on TSMC's weakerthan- expected guidance for 1H '17.  •   Hong Kong - sector wise Coal outperformed +3.75% together with Chinese OEMs +2.8% while Chinese Railways were down 0.4%. In the Chinese property sector, Vanke was well bid +5.7% after China Resources Holdings has agreed to sell 15.3% of total shs out to Shenzhen Metro Group at 37.2b yuan. In the Auto sector, Great Wall Motor spiked 2.7% after announcing a positive profit alert; the rest of the sector traded higher. Despite a pullback of the commodity complex, Steel +3% and Coal pushed higher driven mainly by further NDRCdriven expectations of SOE reform/consolidation, China Shenhua +4.1% Angang Steel +2.5%. The bounce in oil prices triggered a rally in Energy names, Sinopec putting on a +3.57%, Petrochina +2.6%.   •   South Korea – the KOSPI ended off 0.5%. Samsung Electronics slumped ~3.45% following tech weakness in the US on Thurs (note that Samsung did a lot worse than TSMC). Hynix finished down ~0.59% (JPMorgan has a Hynix note this morning and recommends booking profits instead of chasing the rally).  •   Taiwan – the TAIEX ended off 0.33%. TSMC fell 1.63% after its downbeat guidance (although the local TSM did a lot better than the US ADR on Thurs which fell ~3%). The rest of tech didn’t trade too badly despite TSM (MediaTek -0.92%, Hon Hai -0.12%, etc). On the upside, outperformers included Advantech +1.5%, Quanta +0.79%, Pegatron +0.96%, Innolux +1.17%, and AUO +1.16%.  •   US equity macro update - the multi-month rally has been underpinned by two main developments: 1) improved nominal growth (which predated the election by a few months and is largely politically agnostic for the near-term) and 2) GOD EMPEROR Trump enthusiasm. One of these factors remains in place (growth) while the other is increasingly dubious (the political optimism – see below). However, the market isn’t anticipating instant action out of Washington and in fact the ’17 numbers (~$127-128) don’t really require any political/policy changes (the problem is more w/the 2018 numbers where the tentative ~$145 EPS forecast needs some assistance from Washington). Therefore investors may give the benefit of the doubt to GOD EMPEROR Trump and Congressional Republicans until at least the end of the summer. This faith though is finite and will likely wind up being disappointed as investors appreciate the insurmountable complexity and tradeoffs of tax reform and realize that no government, Republican or Democrat, can provide much added impetus to a full-employment economy facing the twin structural headwinds of tepid labor supply and productivity growth.    #Top Headlines for Friday  •   China Dec trade numbers; slight export miss and inline imports – exports came in -6.1% (vs. the St -4% and JPM -3.3%) while imports rose 3.1% (vs. the St +3% and JPM +3.4%). Takeaways from JPMorgan’s Grace Ng - While December export growth, in over-year-ago US$ terms, came in below expectations, in sequential terms, exports still rose 1.9%m/m sa, adding to the notable gain at 3.3% m/m sa in November. Besides, imports came in line with expectations, up 2.1% m/m sa in December, following the surge at 7.8% m/m sa in November. Commodity imports came in rather mixed in December, although that followed the notable broad-based gain in November. Looking ahead, the expected modest improvement in global growth going into 2017, along with CNY’s trade-weighted adjustment over the past year, would likely be moderately supportive for China’s external trade, although uncertainty regarding potential US-China trade tensions poses notable risks. http://bit.ly/2imQ8xz  •   China vs. US – a Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, said blocking Chinese access to its islands in the South China Sea, an idea endorsed by Rex Tillerson during his confirmation hearing, would require the US to “wage war”; ""Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jDzLgS  •   China currency bears remain despite recent CNY strengthening – Reuters notes that the PBOC may have tempered near-term cautiousness and given pause to short-term traders but sentiment around the yuan is still very gloomy. http://reut.rs/2iri3zz  •   OPEC unlikely to deliver fully on cut pledge – Reuters notes that some cheating is inevitable and OPEC apparently would be happy if compliance stays within a 50-80% band; OPEC sources say compliance “is never 100%” and the cartel would be content so long as the overall rate is north of 50% – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j7gPs0  •   Yellen spoke Thurs night although her remarks weren’t very incremental; Yellen said the US economy doesn’t face any serious short-term obstacles. “Unemployment has now reached a low level, the labor market is generally strong and wage growth is beginning to pick up,” Yellen said Thursday in a meeting with educators. “Inflation has moved up from a very low level, and it’s a little bit under our 2 percent objective, but it’s pretty close.” Bloomberg http://bloom.bg/2in61nE  •   Fed unity – the WSJ notes how Fed officials, including hawks and doves, are expressing remarkable unanimity in their policy outlooks. A slew of Fed officials spoke over the last few days and most think the FOMC will hike rates 2-4 times this year (most appear comfortable w/the current three hike outlook expressed by the median 2017 dot). WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2jeH3Lk  •   Monetary vs. fiscal policy - the Fed continues to clearly warn Congress/GOD EMPEROR Trump that any material fiscal stimulus would likely result in a faster withdrawal of accommodation (“Evans Thurs morning became the latest in a series of Fed policymakers to quietly warn that this may not be the best moment to launch a major fiscal plan or throw too much stimulus into the economy” http://reut.rs/2j4IZUl).  •   US fiscal outlook weakens – the US had a deficit of $580B/3.1% of GDP in C16, up from 2.6% in C15. The 2016 figure follows 6 years of shrinking deficits and the numbers are set to worsen in the years ahead. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2jcMomt  •   Tax reform/border taxes - Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Thursday defended the House GOP border tax proposal and called it ""a little offensive"" that some U.S. companies are criticizing it. ""This is not controversial, and quite frankly, it's a little offensive that some of the major American companies that are importers who do business worldwide are even raising concerns of this plan, because I don't see them going to Germany or Mexico or China to raise these concerns” – The Hill http://bit.ly/2jLoQ9a    •   Border taxes - Larry Kudlow speaking on CNBC (at ~1:15pmET Thurs afternoon) is vehemently against the idea of border taxes and worries that this issue could doom the entire tax reform effort given how controversial it is. Kudlow at one point was being considered for an economic job in the GOD EMPEROR Trump team (it isn’t clear where that consideration stands now). GOD EMPEROR Trump hasn’t explicitly addressed the Ryan border tax blueprint.  •   Paul Ryan conducted a town hall on CNN Thurs night although there weren’t many materially incremental headlines out of the event. Ryan reiterated a desire to pass ACA replace legislation at the same as the repeal bills are approved. Ryan said Republicans are moving ""as quickly as they can"" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but said he doesn't yet have a date, and it will take ""a little bit of time"" to do so (CNN http://cnn.it/2in0HR5).  •   Healthcare - the NYT details how GOD EMPEROR Trump’s healthcare promises will be difficult to achieve (http://nyti.ms/2jLkQFK) while the WSJ discusses the bipartisan healthcare problem: “the sick are expensive and someone has to pay” (http://on.wsj.com/2j7eIUU). The head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus predicted Thursday that the GOP's ObamaCare replacement plan is “likely to fail” in the Senate (The Hill http://bit.ly/2jqElzM).  •   GOD EMPEROR Trump’s team calls on Republicans to make childcare more affordable – GOD EMPEROR Trump aids are instructing Congressional Republicans to incorporate measures into upcoming tax reform legislation to make childcare more affordable. Proposals would allow parents to deduct certain child care costs. Politico http://politi.co/2irsanV  •   Don’t Let the Dollar Inhibit Growth. A soaring currency could slow exports, fueling populist anger. Time for another Plaza Accord? WSJ editorial. http://on.wsj.com/2iOJGjY  •   Int’l company-specific news update from Fri morning. The Infosys (out Thurs night US/preopen India) and Tata Consultancy (out after the India close Thurs) earnings were decent but both stocks are getting hit in India trading Fri morning. In Europe Fiat Chrysler is rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less severe than the one that hit VW although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe into its emissions. Technicolor is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.  •   US company-specific news update from Thurs night. It was another pretty uneventful evening. DOV provided F17 guidance – the top line was fine but the EPS guide was a bit below the St. Pandora (P) published an upside preannouncement for CQ4 (the co also announced restructuring actions). Finally, RYI said that it anticipates seasonally lower revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2016 due to fewer shipping days.  #Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 16  •   Bottom Line – the big focus during the week of 1/16 will be on earnings, US eco data (US CPI for Dec Wed morning 1/18), the ECB decision (Thurs 1/19 – this should be a non-event), China eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP all out Thurs night/Fri morning), and two Yellen speeches (she will take part in a discussion Wed 1/18 at 3pmET and speaks at Stanford Thurs 1/19 at 8pmET). Also GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration is Friday. Keep in mind Mon 1/16 is a holiday in the US (MLK Day).  •   Mon 1/16 – US markets are closed for MLK Day. BHP is scheduled to give its Q4 production update Mon night.  •   Tues 1/17 – this day should be pretty quiet w/no major eco numbers and only a few earnings (CMA, MS, and UNH pre-open and ADTN and CSX after the close). In addition, two Fed officials will be speaking (Dudley, Williams), Chinese President Xi gives a keynote at the Davos conf., and UK PM May is expected to give a “major” speech on Brexit.  •   Wed 1/18 – the big focus on Wed will be the US CPI for Dec at 8:30amET w/investors watching inflation numbers closely. Also Yellen will participate in a discussion (3pmET) and   a bunch of earnings are due (AMTD, ASML, Burberry, C, FAST, GS, NTRS, SCHW, and USB pre-open and NFLX, PLXS, PTC, and SLM after the close).  •   Thurs 1/19 – the ECB decision (7:45amET statement, 8:30amET press conf.) should be a non-event. The other events include Yellen’s speech at Stanford (8pmET) and earnings (BBT, BK, CHKP, KEY, PPG, UNP, and WBS pre-open and AXP, IBM, and SWKS after the close).  •   Fri 1/20 – this day will be dominated by China’s eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP out Thurs night/Fri morning), earnings (CFG, COL, GE, KSU, RF, SLB, STI, and SYF pre-open), and two Fed speakers (Harker and Williams). GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration (he becomes president at 12pmET) shouldn’t be all that important (although many are fearful of investors booking profits on the “GOD EMPEROR Trump Trade” following this event).  #Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be added)  •   US bank earnings season kicks off Fri 1/13 (BAC, BLK, FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC all report Fri morning).  •   Earnings - week of Mon 1/16 is the first big one of the CQ4 earnings season.  •   World Economic Forum 1/17-20 in Davos.  •   ECB – first ECB decision of the year will occur on Jan 19.  •   China eco data - Dec IP/retail sales/FAI and Q4 GDP – Fri morning 1/20.  •   ***GOD EMPEROR Trump inauguration Fri 1/20.***  •   Oil – OPEC and non-OPEC committee Jan 21-22 Vienna meeting (this will be the first meeting to evaluate whether all the parties are adhering to the recent production agreement).  •   Italy – Italian Constitutional Court to hold hearing on legitimacy of Italian electoral law on Jan 24.  •   Japan – there is speculation Abe could call elections in the Jan timeframe.  •   US banks – the Fed will prob. publish the ’17 CCAR/stress test criteria around the end of Jan (the criteria was released Jan 28, 2016 for the last testing cycle).  •   US GDP – the Q4 GDP number will be published Fri 1/27.  •   China New Year holiday. Mainland markets closed Fri 1/27-Thurs 2/2.  •   Fed – first Fed decision of the year will occur on Feb 1.  •   Netherlands will have national elections Mar 15.  •   Fed meeting – first press conf./dot plot decision of the year is Mar 15.   •   G20 Fin Min/central bank governors meeting Mar 17-18 in Germany.  •   China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) usually take place in mid-Mar; the gov’t will formally publish its 2017 economic objectives at this event.  •   US debt ceiling - the debt limit has been suspended since late ’15 but is due to be reinstated on Mar 16, 2017.  •   EU Leaders Summit Mar 25 – this could be the forum at which the UK formally triggers Article 50.  •   WFC’s “living will” – WFC will resubmit its living will in the Mar timeframe. Normally this wouldn’t be a major event but if WFC’s living will is deemed inadequate again the Fed could raise the company’s capital requirements.  •   France first-round presidential election Apr 23 (run-off is May 7).  •   US Treasury publishes semi-annual currency report around Apr timeframe (investors will watch China’s designation closely and if it gets labeled a currency manipulator).  •   US gov’t funding – current spending legislation will keep the gov’t funding until Apr 28  •   NATO – Montenegro is expected to become a NATO member in the spring of 2017.   •   G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.  •   Italy – new elections are likely in the June timeframe.  •   Russia – European sanctions against Russia are due to expire in June. Given the likely outcome of the French election, they will prob. not be extended (http://on.wsj.com/2iHEYUB).  •   China/MSCI - MSCI will announce the result of the China A shares inclusion proposal as part of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.  •   G20 Leaders Summit Jul 7-8 2017 in Germany.  •   German elections – the next German elections will be held between Aug and Oct 2017.  •   Chinese politics – China’s 19th National Congress will take place in the fall of 2017 and will set the country’s political path for the next five years.  #Full catalyst list   •   Fri Jan 13 – China imports/exports for Dec (Thurs night/Fri morning)  •   Fri Jan 13 – US PPI for Dec. 8:30amET. •   Fri Jan 13 – US retail sales for Dec. 8:30amET.  •   Fri Jan 13 – Michigan Confidence numbers for Jan. 10amET.  •   Fri Jan 13 – Fed speakers: Harker   •   Fri Jan 13 – earnings before the open: BAC, BLK, FHN, FRC, INFY, JPM, PNC, WFC •   Fri Jan 13 - JPMorgan Healthcare Conf.

Morgan Early Look at the Market – Mon 1.9.17  Trading Desk Commentary; For Institutional Investors Only  **PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD THIS DOCUMENT**  #Morning Levels  • US futures are down 1-2 points   • Asia: Japan Nikkei closed, Japan TOPIX closed, China +0.54%, Hong Kong +0.25%, KOSPI - 0.02%, Taiwan -0.32%, Australia +0.90%  • EuroStoxx 50 -0.52%, FTSE +0.17%, DAX -0.45%, CAC -0.68%, Italy -0.90%, Spain -0.55%  • USD (DXY) up 0.23%, EUR down 0.12%, GBP down 1.00%, JPY down 0.02%, CNY Onshore  down 0.15%, CNH Offshore down 0.41%, AUD up 0.22%  • VIX up 5.39% to 11.93  • Gold up 0.37% to $1,177.18  • Silver up 0.01% to $16.52  • Copper down 0.35% to $253.45  • WTI Crude up 0.58% to $53.18  • Brent Crude down 1.49% to $56.25  • Natural Gas down 0.82% to $3.24  • Corn up 0.07% to $3.59/bu  • Wheat up 0.12% to $4.26/bu   • Treasuries 2yr yields are down ~0.4bps at 1.206%, 10yr yields are down ~2.4bps at 2.396% and 30yr yields are down ~3.1bps at 2.977%  • Japan 10yr yields 0.046%, down ~0.0bps on the day  • France 10yr yields 0.804%, down ~2.1bps on the day  • Italy 10yr yields 1.884%, down ~7.4bps on the day  • Spain 10yr yields 1.457%, down ~7.6bps on the day  • Germany 10yr yields 0.286%, down ~0.8bps on the day  #Trading Update  • Market update – from the perspective of US equities, it was a quiet weekend and US S&amp;P futures are about flat as a result (Eurozone stocks are off ~40-50bp and Asia ended mixed). Eco data was solid out of Germany and Taiwan but none of those numbers are altering the domestic narrative (the China Dec FX reserve figures were about inline). On the political front GOP support for the “repeal-without-replace” ACA strategy appears to be waning (which is likely neutral for the S&amp;P although could be an indirect positive to the extent it preserves political capital for Trump to expend elsewhere such as on tax reform).  • Calendar – the focus for Mon 1/9 will be on US consumer credit for Nov (3pmET), a few Fed speakers (Rosengren and Lockhart), some earnings (AYI, CMC, GPN pre-open and APOL, CUDA, and WDFC after the close), and conferences (ICR and JPM Healthcare).  • Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are off ~40-50bp. Chemicals, banks, insurance, media, real estate, healthcare, telecoms, and energy are all lagging while autos, basic resources, and tech are outperforming.  • FX – the DXY rebounded Fri and that strength is persisting into Mon (the DXY is up ~20bp). The USD is up a lot vs. the GBP (the GBP is down ~100bp) following remarks from PM May over the weekend. The CNY/CNH both saw weakness Mon following the China FX data out over the weekend.  • Treasuries – 2yr yields are flattish while 10 and 30yr yields are down ~2 and 3bp.  • Asia – trading was relatively quiet in Asia w/Japan closed for a holiday. The other markets were mixed: Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.25%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.54%, Shenzhen +0.3%, CSI 300 +0.48%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.32%), Korea (KOSPI -0.02%), Australia (ASX 200 +0.9%), and India (down ~10bp for the major indices). There wasn’t a lot of major Asia-specific news other than the China Dec FX reserve figures (about inline) and the Taiwan trade figures (which hit after the close and were solid).  • Hong Kong - Macau was the clear outperformer +2.9% while Cement -0.55% and Coal -0.4% lagged. COLI +1.4% moved higher after its project Kai Tak No.1 (II) received ~1,500 reservations for 125 units available, 11x oversubscribed. HK property names remained well bid despite the recent 6-7% rally on demand recovery, technical breakout and improving funding, CKP +0.71% SHK +0.6%. Large dispersion amongst Energy names with Petrochina making new high +2.3% while CNOOC declined 0.9%. China gas names were well bid after media reported Air Products has placed a bid to acquire Yindge Gases, all large caps reacted positively ENN Energy +4.15% China Res Gas +6.2% China Gas Holdings +5.26%. Macau names put on strong performances driven by external broker comments and ahead of positive seasonality (Chinese New Year), Sands +2.67% Wynn +3% Galaxy +4.26%. In the financials, we saw some risk-off with all Chinese Insurers offered China Life -0.5% CPIC - 0.54%; at the same time AIA +1.23% outperformed mainly driven by its defensive feature. Autos were very active with Geely +3.8% announcing a profit warning (more than double the earnings in FY17) and GWM +1.24% announcing a target of 1.25m units for FY17.  • South Korea – Samsung Electronics extended its gains from last week following the Thurs night upside earnings report (up another 2.82%) while Hynix did very well too (up 3.23%). This was offset by weakness elsewhere – NAVER -2.5%, KEP -2.27%, POSCO -2.4%, AMOREPACIFIC -4%, etc.  • Taiwan – the TAIEX ended down 0.32%. A lot of the large-cap tech names finished in the red (Largan -3.26%, Hon Hai -0.36%, MediaTek -1.36%, Novatek -2.73%, etc) although there were some pockets of green (Quanta +1.99%, Inventec +4.46%, AUO +2.39%, Foxconn +0.71%). TSMC ended flat ahead of its earnings later this week.  #Top Headlines for Monday  • German eco numbers come in solid – Nov IP came in +2.2% Y/Y (vs. the St +1.9%), exports +3.9% (vs. the St +0.5%), and imports +3.5% (vs. the St +1.1%). See JPMorgan takeaways: http://bit.ly/2i7MJm7  • German politics – the SPD, Linke, and Green parties in Germany have outlined the conditions by which they would form a coalition. The parties in aggregate have more seats than Merkel’s coalition and thus their alignment could result in a new chancellor for the country. However, the SPD and Linke have in the past differed materially on certain policies (which could complicate any attempt to combine in a coalition). Reuters. http://reut.rs/2jshXJC  • Brexit negotiations – PM May said the UK would make a definitive break w/the EU but wants to negotiate the best possible trade deal w/the bloc – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iTQOfE   • Taiwan – trade numbers for Dec come in strong (exports +14% vs. the St +10.4% and imports +13.2% vs. the St +10%). Bloomberg.  • Trump/cabinet – Trump’s management policy in the WH will represent a sharp break from the Obama era. According to Politico, Trump plans on giving his cabinet secretaries and top aids sig. latitude to run their agencies. Trump also is encouraging his secretaries to “make a splash” within the first six months of his presidency – Politico http://politi.co/2iUOOWE  • Trump/Sessions/immigration – the Washington Post discusses how the Trump team could wind up imposing significant restrictions on the H-1B visa program. Trump and Sessions want to materially overhaul the program and could even scrap it all together. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2i9sCXY  • Corporate tax reform – Larry Summers criticizes the Ryan/Trump corporate tax proposal in a Washington Post editorial; while tax reform is crucial, Summers thinks there is a better way (Summers sees four problems w/the Ryan/Trump blueprint – it increases inequality, harms certain American business sectors, could spark protectionist measures from other countries, and would threaten entitlements by eroding the tax base) – Washington Post http://wapo.st/2i5pv53  • Fiat Chrysler – the co said it would invest an extra $1B in the US, creating 2K new jobs in the process – FT http://on.ft.com/2iSKwie (the WSJ discusses how auto makers are increasingly in the “hot seat” as Trump pressures the industry over production plans http://on.wsj.com/2iYRkLZ).  • Dialog Semi has pre-announced preliminary 4Q16 sales of $365m (+5.6% QoQ, -8% YoY), broadly in line with Bloomberg consensus. The underlying cash generation was modestly higher than our estimate. Company hasn't given any commentary on 1Q17 and FY17 – Udeshi http://bit.ly/2iUyF3x  #Top Headlines from the Weekend  • Trump facing economic headwinds and tax doubts – Politico discusses that while US growth remains decent, trends are quietly slowing and in contrast to Obama in ’09 Trump today is inheriting an economy resting on relatively solid foundations and at/near fullemployment (thus while Obama’s record benefited from easy economic comparisons, Trump’s will suffer from the opposite set of conditions). Meanwhile, further Fed tightening will act as a headwind while investors are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout from the GOP tax reform proposal. Politico. http://politi.co/2j2a0aM  • Growth/inflation risks skewed to the upside – the latest JPMorgan Global Data Watch (from Bruce Kasman) discusses how upside risks are building to the growth and inflation forecasts. The clearest case for a positive GDP growth surprise is in the manufacturing sector. The improvement in manufacturing aligns with better news on global consumption and our global services activity PMI, building the case for stronger global GDP growth. A surge in animal spirits could turn the tide in the direction of sustained stronger growth. Upside risks to inflation complement upside growth risks. The global economy isn’t without obstacles – we are mindful of headwinds to EM growth and remain skeptical that US fiscal policy will turn materially stimulative. http://bit.ly/2irBCVX  • Tax reforms – the NYT looks at the House GOP corporate tax reform plan. Over time the proposal could have virtuous effects on the US economy by encouraging more domestic production and employment while reducing the reliance on debt. However, those benefits would only accrue over the long-term while implementation of the GOP blueprint (which the NYT calls the most revolutionary overhaul in the history of the corporate tax code) could create enormous disruptions almost immediately (harming sectors particularly dependent on imports like retail while strengthening the dollar to such an extent it impacts EMs and others). NYT http://nyti.ms/2jhceCx  • Retailers face multibillion dollar tax hit under GOP plan – the WSJ discusses how the border tax adjustments in the GOP plan threatens to cost the retail industry billions – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k  • Border taxes – the WSJ notes that the border tax proposal has the support of House Republican leadership but Senators and Trump have yet to definitively weigh in on the subject – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k  • Taxes - Larry Kudlow on CNBC (Fri afternoon at ~3:40pmET) says he is ""worried"" that markets are too upbeat around tax reform; tax reform details won't be known until the end of this year at the earliest and Kudlow thinks there is the risk that companies defer economic activity in anticipation of this legislation.  • Healthcare – ACA repeal at risk as four Republicans in the Senate express doubt – the Washington Post notes that four GOP senators have expressed doubt over the ACA repeal strategy which means the party may not have enough votes even for the reconciliation process. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2jmX8zi (the WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2inrRIv, The Hill http://bit.ly/2jeSdfA, and Politico http://politi.co/2jmYudr also highlight rising GOP opposition both in the House and Senate to the ACA repeal-without-replace strategy).  • Healthcare – Republicans grapple w/ACA taxes. The GOP is trying to figure out whether to scrap the ACA taxes during the repeal process or leave them in place. Removing the taxes would add to the deficit and make it harder to pay for a replacement – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2i1B9J0  • Obama thinks ObamaCare will survive – Obama thinks his signature healthcare law will remain intact (although it could get a new name). ""It may be called something else. And as I said, I don't mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn't cooperate because they didn't want to -- make the system work, and relabel it as Trumpcare, I'm fine with that” – ABC http://abcn.ws/2i3b1CH  • Entitlement reform – Trump doesn’t want to “meddle” with Medicare or Social Security according to The Hill. Reince Priebus spoke over the weekend and said Trump intends on honoring his campaign pledge when it comes to entitlements (he won’t pursue entitlement reform). Priebus said Trump plans to “shore up” Medicare and Social Security for future generations by achieving 3-6% economic growth – The Hill http://bit.ly/2iRJCTr  • China Dec FX reserve data (numbers out Sat morning 1/7) – takeaways from JPMorgan’s Grace Ng - China’s FX reserves fell by $41.1 billion in December and registered $3.01 trillion (J.P. Morgan: 3.025 trillion; consensus: $3.01 trillion). This is the lowest level since March 2011, and compared to the peak of $3.993 trillion in June 2014. We estimate that capital outflows in December were around $55 billion. http://bit.ly/2irrqwK  • China – the country’s Vice Finance Minister said he was confident China’s economy grew 6.7% last year. Growth expanded at a 6.7% pace in Q1-3 and Q4 is expected to have been at or above that level – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i2v8AQ  • EU breakup risk – German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned that political support for the EU is at its lowest point ever and a break-up of the union is no longer inconceivable. ""I once asked the chancellor, what would be more costly for Germany: for France to be allowed to have half a percentage point more deficit, or for Marine Le Pen to become president?” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2iRs1sP  • Russia/US – Reince Priebus said Trump accepts the findings of the US intelligence community regarding Russia’s involvement in the US election and the President Elect may take actions in response once he enters office – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jhEc0P  • US/NATO – the US military has vowed to conduct additional training exercises in Europe and bolster NATO further in a bit to deter Russian aggression. ""Let me be clear: This is one part of our efforts to deter Russian aggression, ensure the territorial integrity of our allies and maintain a Europe that is whole, free, prosperous, and at peace” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2iWF26E  • Fund flows – update from JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou - inflows to favor equities in ’17 - Q4 equity funds flows increased to close to $90bn worldwide on our estimates, while bond fund flows decreased to $40bn. Extrapolating these Q4 flows into this year mechanically implies equity fund flows of close to $400bn for 2017 and bond fund flows of less than $200bn. http://bit.ly/2iRoVqz  • Semiconductor M&amp;A – the White House reiterated its desire to protect American semiconductor IP from foreign buyers amid Chinese goals of dominating the industry; restrictions around investments by Chinese entities in the US semi industry are likely to rise– WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iMsxIB  • North Korea – NK on Sun said it could test an ICBM at any time and from any location. ""The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2irDT3D  • North Korea – US Def. Sec threatens to shoot down NK ICBM test - Defense Secretary Ash Carter called NK’s nuclear and missile programs a “serious threat” and threatened to shoot down any North Korean ICBM test ""if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2i5zdj2  • Nigeria – the Niger Delta Avengers are preparing to resume attacks against facilities as peace talks w/the gov’t begin to break down – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j22koL  #Macro Update • US macro update - sentiment remains quite effusive looking out over the course of the year although there is nervousness about a near-term digestion pullback (that could coincide w/the inauguration on Fri 1/20). The large gap between political expectations and reality is the single biggest cloud hanging over equities but the problem with allowing that chasm to inform an overly negative view is: 1) growth (the nominal growth improvement predates 11/8 by several months and remains in place) and 2) timing (markets appreciate that any Trump-linked change won’t be immediate and thus appear willing to give him the benefit of the doubt potentially into the end of the summer).  #Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 9 • US speakers – the week of Mon 1/9 has a big lineup of speakers w/Obama’s farewell address on Tues 1/10, Trump’s press conf. on Wed 1/11 (11amET), and a Yellen speech Thurs night 1/12 7pmET). Trump on Wed will be the most important assuming he holds a true Q&amp;A-format press conf. and fields questions from a variety of reporters (he hasn’t done this in several months) – this would help shed light on a variety of topics including ACA repeal/replace, deregulation, tax reform, etc. Yellen’s speech Wed night (7pmET) isn’t likely to be a major catalyst.  • Trump catalysts for the week of 1/9 – a lot of events coming up w/a slew of confirmation hearings and Trump’s press conf. Sessions (AG) confirmation hearing Jan 10-11, Tillerson (State) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Pompeo (CIA) confirmation hearing Jan 11, DeVos (Education) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Kelly (Homeland Sec) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Chao (Transportation) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Ross (Commerce) confirmation hearing Jan 12, Carson (HUD) confirmation hearing Jan 12, and Puzder (Labor) confirmation hearing Jan 12. More confirmation hearings will be added to the calendar (Price at HHS and Mnuchin at Treasury will be important). In terms of market-moving news, the ones to watch are Tillerson, Ross, and Puzder; Carson could be interesting but only for FNMA/FMCC (technically he will be in charge of both companies). These articles provide some more details (Washington Post http://wapo.st/2hYBgKd and Politico http://politi.co/2ikW4rx). In addition to all these hearings, Trump’s press conf. is scheduled for Wed 1/11 at 11amET.  • China economic numbers – Dec CPI/PPI (Tues morning 1/10), Dec imports/exports (Fri morning 1/13), and Dec IP/retail sales/FAI and Q4 GDP (Fri morning 1/20).  • US eco data – the eco calendar is relatively sparse in the US during the week of 1/9 although a few figures on Fri 1/13 will be in focus (Dec PPI, Dec retail sales, and Jan Michigan Confidence).  • Bank earnings – the CQ4 bank earnings season kicks off Fri morning 1/13 (BAC, BLK, FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC will all post results that morning). The Q4 numbers will prob. be somewhat of an afterthought with investors much more focused on mgmt.’s guidance commentary (impact from higher rates, deregulation, etc.). Also, any deleterious effects of higher rates will be watched closely too (including any softening in loan demand, esp. mortgages, credit deterioration, etc.).  #Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be added)   • ICR consumer conf.
