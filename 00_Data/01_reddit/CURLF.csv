I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advice. This is purely my opinion. If you invest based on what I say alone, you are definitely retarded.   If you have been following weed investing, you will notice that despite superior earnings and performance, US cannabis trades for less and in relatively low volume.  As of right now they cannot trade on any major exchange only OTC.  If what the CEO said in a recent report is correct, this may change very soon.  https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/marijuana/video/curaleaf-exec-expects-u-s-pot-companies-soon-to-uplist-on-major-exchanges~2157478   Curaleaf ($CURLF) just crushed quarterly earnings and as far as I can tell, no other company is even close;  Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a record $230.3 million, an increase of 205.1% compared to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 26.2% sequentially.  (SOURCE)(https://ir.curaleaf.com/2021-03-09-Curaleaf-Reports-Record-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-End-2020-Financial-and-Operational-Results#:~:text=Total%20Revenue%20for%20the%20fourth,of%202020%20increased%2026.2%25%20sequentially.)  This is mostly because of their thirsty executive team re-investing their profits to expand to every state possible in the US.  They also just recently announced a European acquisition making them only one of 2 companies legally selling in the two largest markets in the world with ambitions of also opening up in Africa as well.  (SOURCE)(https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/03/10/curaleaf-to-expand-to-europe-with-286-million-acquisition-eyes-eastern-europe-and-africa-next/?sh=5225bd621f04)  They are already the biggest company in the US, will soon be the biggest in the world.  One of the other issues facing the US industry as a whole is banking.  Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.  https://www.marketplace.org/2021/02/26/will-congress-consider-giving-marijuana-companies-access-to-big-banks/  I don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.  Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market.  If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play.

I‚Äôm building a new account using pot stocks for the most part as a challenge. My goal is to reach 100k in the next few months. I started with around 10k in early January and I‚Äôm already up \~9k. You can obviously see the success of Canadian pot stocks in the market right now and it seems like they are far outperforming US pot stocks. There‚Äôs a good reason for this! Exposure. Congrats to those of you trading TLRY and Aphria (the merger is going to be sick) but those gains won‚Äôt outperform US pot stocks in the long run, especially when decriminalization occurs. Let me explain: advisor shares has two excellent ETFs that hold both US Multi State Operators (MSOS ETF) and global marijuana operators (YOLO ETF). I believe marijuana legislation is coming hard and swift in this year (next few months btw) so I‚Äôve opened a Robinhood for just potstock options. As you can see I‚Äôm already up quite a bit and I believe the space will run very hard. I‚Äôm expecting double digit % days closer to legalization. These gains happened right after the dems won senate and most people don‚Äôt even know about these US MSOs. The big draw back for US potstocks so far has been the inability to bank and listing on NYSE for the individual names (CURLF, TCNNF, GTBIF) meaning you can only buy these on OTC markets (TDameritrade) and you can only use limit orders since market orders aren‚Äôt available OTC. Upon federal decriminalization (not even legalization) these organization will be allowed to trade on the NYSE allowing big money to get in. Luckily you can buy MSOS and YOLO which hold these companies and it‚Äôs available on Robinhood if you refuse to trade OTC. Wish me luck on my quest to 100k!

In 2018, Canopy Growth made more millionaires than any other stock. Legislative change, uplisting to major exchanges (NYSE), and huge institutional investment created the perfect storm and it was a bunch of unsophisticated investors (read: **retards**) that got rich off of it.      Today, a similar story is evolving in US Cannabis in real-time, with a total addressable market that absolutely DOMINATES Canada's, and the emergence of unique tailwinds (e.g. COVID, social justice) to drive acceleration of and acceptance of Cannabis far beyond what Canada achieved.        **The core of the investment thesis is dead simple.** Cannabis is federally illegal. This has **prevented large institutions** from investing in American Cannabis companies and provided a once in a generation opportunity for retail to make real money.  The democratic sweep of the house, senate, presidency will lead to cannabis reform. Even if the absence of federal legalization, the conditions that led to meteoric rise of Canadian cannabis are being replicated south of the border.

Today, a similar story is evolving in US Cannabis in real-time, with a total addressable market that absolutely DOMINATES Canada's, and the emergence of unique tailwinds (e.g. COVID, social justice) to drive acceleration of and acceptance of Cannabis far beyond what Canada achieved.  **The core of the investment thesis is dead simple.** Cannabis is federally illegal. This has **prevented large institutions** from investing in American Cannabis companies and provided a once in a generation opportunity for retail to make real money.

Its the trifecta of Tendie Town. (1) Proven demand since fucking 1800, (2) an unprecedented, once-in-a-lifetime catalyst on the horizon in US legalization, and (3) the rare occasion when retail can get in before institutions because institutions are too scared to touch it right now.  But somehow you idiots can be so right, yet so wrong a the same time. But have no fear, I created this account just to save you, because, well idk why but I thought you guys didnt deserve the misery of being wrong yet again.  APHA, ACB, and CGC are NOT the way. These stocks peaked years ago when Canada legalized weed. US legalization means US weed stocks üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ aka GTIFB and CURLF  The primary reasons the US is legalizing weed is for monetary and economic reasons (taxes and jobs for the people on the short bus). The US is not going to go through the trouble of legalizing weed, just import Canadian weed and allow them to capitalize on the economics of it. US will prop up their own production, and tariff any Canadian imports to hell. I would be surprised if a single dime bag of Canadian weed ever gets imported to the US, why would it? Weed is easy to grow and the US is more than capable of it meeting the demand.  If you need more convincing, Curaleaf did 200+ million in revenue LAST QUARTER and Greenthumb did \~160+ million and both companies are profitable already.  The problem is that you cannot buy US weed operators (GTIFB and CURLF) on Robinhood because they trade OTC on lesser known Canadian exchanges. Cant buy them on Merrill Edge either so cant blame Robinhood for everything. But, Fidelity does, so go make a Fidelity and YOLO into the real US weed winners and thank me in two years.  IF you need even more convincing, the first domino to fall in legalization will be allowing US operators to list on major exchanges like NYSE but by then itll be too late for the retail investor.

You degenerates regularly give me a good laugh, though every now and again I do strike gold and learn something here. However, given my job, I can't trade options at all and I can't sell short. Basically, the only things I'm allowed to do are buy and hold equities. An additional restriction is that when I buy an equity, if I'm in the green, I must hold it for a minimum of 60 days prior to exiting (though I can sell for a loss at any time). So with that, I want to share one of my picks in 2020 that I likely won't be exiting any time soon, and that's Curaleaf - CURLF.  Yeah, yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking- this guy must be high. But I digress.  I believe that Curaleaf is in the best position, nationally, to take advantage of the continued shift towards Marijuana policy at the state level and even more importantly, the national level (SAFE Banking Act and/orMORE Act - if Congress doesn't completely shit itself). Right now they are operating in 23 states, with 96 dispensaries, 26 cultivation or grow sites, and have over 30 processing sites.  I see public opinion continue to shift in favor of Marijuana and I see a shitload of states crying out poor us, with fucked budgets - well, what better way to make some money than to legalize Marijuana at some level and then tax the shit out of it? Look at Colorado. They did so well with Marijuana that they said fuck it, let's get everyone on the Mushroom trip.  For anyone that hasn't heard of them, Curaleaf is the largest vertically integrated Marijuana company in the United States (by measure of revenue after their acquisition of GrassRoots in July 2020). For my fellow uneducated types, vertically integrated means that they own the entire process from seed to sale - the cultivation or growing sites, to the processing sites, to the actual dispensaries where the product is sold - and they are headquartered in Wakefield, Mass - not in some obscure place in Canada. What even is Canada, but America's hat? Socialists. The legal Marijuana business across the US generated about 13.6 billion in 2019 and MorningStar Financial believes that it will continue to grow by a 25% average per year in the recreational market and 15% within the medical market.   Their growth has been nothing short of astounding - primarily driven via acquisitions. Each quarter they are successfully building on their strategy of launching / opening additional retail locations in key untapped markets, expanding in their current markets, all while pushing their own Select brand, with higher margins. Here's a good article from their billionaire backer on Forbes on where he sees the company going in the longer term, quote to be the ""FritoLay of Cannabis"".

Some of them have recently made partnerships/purchase to create inroads into the expanding US market, but that's not what were gonna talk about here.  As you know, 5 more fuckin states just legalized marijuana in some form or another, and it's the EXISTING US-based licensed firms that are going to be most effectively poised to take over market share and expand into these new states.   The US loves having companies jump through a bunch of legal hoops to get licensed to operate, and in the weed sector many companies have what is called a Multi-State Operating license or MSO. You will know some of these companies already; but you aren't able to buy options or shares for them because they are only listed in the US OTC because of existing regulations. Robinhood sure as fuck doesn't support them, and since that's the only broker you use/know about, you are missing out on BIG tendies.  How do we get around these nasty regulations that are getting in the way of your 420 dreams?  **Introducing the MSOS Pure-US Cannabis ETF**  Listed on 9/1/2020 and having **options** listed as of a few days ago, this ETF will give you direct exposure to the major players already operating in the US. **You MIGHT be aware of a few of their top holdings if you haven't been living in your mom's basement**.  * Green Thumb Industries * Curaleaf Holdings * Trulieve Cannabis * Cresco Labs * Growgeneration Corp * Innovative Industrial  **But what about the household names like APHA, and that one amazingly rock solid company HEXO that Robinhood has access to?**  They operate in Canada, num nuts! You think they just going to hop international borders and be a powerhouse in benefitting from the US wave of legalization? Yeah right, **America First pussies!**  * Total combined legal sales of medical and adult-use cannabis in the U.S. are projected to reach $35 billion by 2025. * Total U.S. illicit cannabis market reached an estimated $66 billion in 2019. * Five additional states could pass legalization measures in November 2020, adding a further $3.3 billion in annual legal sales before 2025. - **This happened. And guess what, this happening has increased pressure on other states as well as the Federal Government to finally get with the fuckin' times and treat MJ like the cash crop that it is. Everybody is going to want a slice of that sweet sweet tax pie.** * Jurisdictions with the highest density of cannabis consumers are Oregon, D.C., Colorado and Vermont. * 67% of Americans support full federal legalization, an increase from 41% in 2010. * 230 Million Americans live in states with legalized medical or adult-use cannabis, representing 70% of the U.S. population.  **This is America, we love our alcohol, sex, drugs and rock and roll.**  You can bet your sweet titties that 2021 is going to be a big year for growth in the market and for the already established licensed multi-state operators in the US.  No good DD is complete without one, and since I know you fucks like pictures **look at this fuckin GRAPH.**  &amp;#x200B;  [Numbers are going UP obviously, very similar to the trajectory of fucking STONKS. \(They go UP\)](https://preview.redd.it/qmxbovsqwe161.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62dc8e893aaac17dc7c081578d737ff3a3fa81ec)  **So why should I care about this ETF MSOS?**  Because accessing OTC/alternatively listed stocks isn't available with every broker. This ETF holds a basket of all the main players and is listed on the US exchanges. It was recently listed at 30$ and after a pre-election uncertainty dip as risen back to initial offering price. Currently sitting pretty at 30.44.  **And before a couple days ago, options weren't available. AND NOW THEY ARE.**  So get your dicks out for Harambe, light up a bleezy and BUY some motherfucking CALL OPTIONS. This is NOT an overnight play; I know for most of you this is going to instantly be a turn off. But for the rest of you autists who I somehow miraculously still have your attention; here is some fucking positions.  **MSOS 3/19/21 - 31c**  **MSOS 3/19/21 - 35c**  **MSOS 6/18/21 - 35c**  Yes, OI is low.. the options chain just came out like fuckin yesterday dude. Everybody always complaining about missing great stonks before they pick up steam and hit the mainstream. **This is the time to get in; at the jump.**  Thanks for listening and if you weren't listening the TLDR is below, which I'll combine with an ELI5 for the extra retarded.  **TLDR/ELI5:**  weed legal in US many more now, bidet make ez more weed legal, weed stonk go up in US next year bigly.

What a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is the big-time investment opportunities in the cannabis space are not with the Canadian LPs but the US MSO‚Äôs. The Untied States market has the potential to completely drawf the Canadian market.  In fact, the California cannabis market is larger then the Canadian market on its own.  The 4 major US MSOs (CURLF, GTBIF, TCNNF, CRLBF) all just posted breakout quarters and are demonstrating encouraging growth trends. The Canadian LPs have gotten a lot more recognition since they have the ability to trade on the major exchanges whereas their US counterparts have to trade OTC. Now I know what most of you are thinking... no major exchange listing = no options and no robinhood.  However, there is a NASDAQ listed ETF which provides you exposure to US MSOs through swap agreements: YOLO      Upcoming Catalysts for the US cannabis sector:  NJ and AZ legalization on the ballot in November- legalization in NJ is viewed relatively favorably among voters and many people don‚Äôt realize how big of a deal that can be. Legalization in NJ will most likely cause a domino effect of legalization in NY, PA, CT so they don‚Äôt miss out on tax revenue ‚Äì this has been discussed by many analysts covering the space.  SAFE banking act- this has been discussed in the news as of late as the democrats would like to add it to the up coming stimulus deal. It remains to be seen if the current Republican led congress would approve this. However, there will be a lot of pressure in the coming months for this to be approved, especially if the democrats take control in November. SAFE banking will allow greater flows of money for US MSO‚Äôs and would possibly allow them to trade on the major exchanges- this would be a HUGE deal as it would allow buying from the large mutual funds, more hedge fund exposure, robin hood investors, and CNBC coverage.  Democratic sweep in November- it remains to be seen what this would entail but vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris has bee vocal about legalization in the past.   For these reasons I am expecting a run-up in US cannabis equities toward the election  YOLO Nov 14 C|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1420581|public|confidence|self|Why I‚Äôm Yolo‚Äôing YOLO|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idztvk/why_im_yoloing_yolo/|no_ads|0||||||||||2020-08-21|CURLF

This is a market that will forever change the economic landscape for the countries involved in bringing about a legal marketplace. For investment purposes The Marijuana sector is comprised of two main markets at the moment IMO. There is Canada and there is the United States.   In Canada marijuana has had a strong country wide recognized legal marijuana system built for corporate control since the introduction of the MMPR in 2013. Provinces and their national govt have been in lockstep throughout (mostly) and this has created stability for investors. This has led to companies such as Tilray and Canopy Growth Corp and a few other small corporate entities sucking up Billions of real investment dollars from individuals and even [Fortune 500 beverage companies](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-closes-5-billion-constellation-brands-investment-transaction/). Accordingly this resulted in a gross overvaluation of these companies that operate legal cannabis operations. Take a look at these [financial reports](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/financials/) and tell me if this seems like an effectively managed and run outfit. No one cares about what I see as fairly obvious poor management and at its peak this company was worth over 10 Billion in market cap.  In the US everything is fragmented by unique state laws. The one unifying law is the schedule 1 status that dictates federal illegality. This is where opportunity for us lies. Due to this status that‚Äôs purely [fucking stupid](https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling) investment banks and corporations such as the one that gifted Canopy 4 Billion can not reasonably invest into these companies that are in many ways far outperforming Canopy at the time of that multi billion dollar investment. All while existing in far more attractive markets once the concern of federal interference is lifted. Imagine investing in UBER or Facebook far before a bank or large stakeholder gave them billions of dollars in return for a large interest of the company. This is where the marijuana industry is at in the United States. You can invest before the banks and financial institutions.  I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail about the Canadian market but the point is that the entire nation is comparable to the state of California with absolutely none of the branding potential due to many different factors. Canada may lead in the international market opportunities but its apparent that that is slowly developing and not as attractive as Canadian companies may hope it to be [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/monazhang/2017/11/07/global-marijuana-market-31-billion-investors-cautious/amp/). imo the US is a far more attractive business space for cannabis due to available expendable income and branding potential.   At the end of the day investing in this sector is about finding the next McDonald‚Äôs or Starbucks. Anyone can sell a cup of coffee or a shitty cheeseburger (or mediocre weed). Yet here are two mega billion dollar corporations that have billions of people across the world addicted to their product. This is what I‚Äôm looking for. As someone who is pretty experienced trying different quality weed;  in my opinion the company that takes the lead is going to be about delivering quality of product (unlike Starbucks and McDonalds) and the leader is far from established at the moment.   I was going to make this a lot more detailed with more links but I‚Äôm going to leave a lot of the digging to you. Most of the info you need is going to be in the corporate documents. You should take the time and learn to read 10-q, k, and all corporate documents when making an investment of this length. I‚Äôll start taking profits after large institutions begin making sizable investments similar to constellation‚Äôs. Could be a year, or 5. I really can‚Äôt say with certainty but I do feel it‚Äôs coming sooner rather than later with bipartisan legislation such as the [S.T.A.T.E.S. Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATES_Act) being introduced. The political aspect of this is continuously moving in the right direction and there is strong indication that big banks are pushing the right people towards cannabis reform with Trump signaling his support as well as other traditionally conservative (towards drug policy) politicians.  Credit to u/CannaVestments for this quick [overview](https://imgur.com/a/dpv4qVi) which is accurate to my knowledge.  (TCNNF) The one I like the most is Trulieve [link](https://vimeo.com/313083903). They dominate the Florida market with over 500k sq ft of grow space and soon to be 30 dispensaries. No other company dominates a region like trulieve and they are doing it in one of the most attractive marijuana markets in the world with tourism and retirees everywhere to give them their expendable income once full legalization comes into effect. Financials are attractive [link](https://www.trulieve.com/investors). The only public company in the entire industry worldwide with financials that look like an actually profitable and compelling investment. More than that is their philosophy of business. They don‚Äôt make massive acquisitions. Their 4 million dollar investment in Massachusetts (100k sq ft cultivation license + 3 dispensaries I believe) can easily turn into 4 million a quarter in roughly a year. This is good for shareholders which btw is majority insider controlled and locked up until July [link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/trulieve-cannabis-corp-announces-voluntary-lock-up-agreements-with-company-founders-804831853.html). Right now fully diluted the company is valued around 1B in market cap. Compared to peers this is a steal. Canopy saw 10B and this company had better revs last reported quarter in 2018 (annual report due on April 30) not to mention strong profits and all the other important metrics that put its peers to shame. Compared to canopy‚Äôs valuation you can see why I‚Äôm so excited about this opportunity.  I think the fear for investors here is the market is immature and people are doubting they can hold onto their lead. Florida has previously capped stores to 30 and many other operators had yet to build out. Trulieve however just won an important suit that has ruled that cap unconstitutional [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-judge-marijuana-dispensaries-cap-20190204-story,amp.html). I think it‚Äôs too late for competitors and it‚Äôs trulieves market to lose based on government and legal actions recently. The cost to entry is high and every other competitor is operating in debt and making acquisitions that cost hundreds of millions of dollars instead of organic growth.   The other issue is that they don‚Äôt have the license getting skills in other states and will have to make large acquisitions going forward, which may be true but I think patience will reveal opportunity like in Massachusetts. They will target cheaper license getters or struggling license holders without the means or knowledge to buildout and use their profits while their competitors struggle with debt. This is my yolo essentially. I‚Äôll diversify but due to share structure and insider control as well as the other factors this is the most attractive company in the US by a large margin imo. I think anything under $15 is a good buy and don‚Äôt think it stays under $20 much longer.  (GTBIF) The next one I like is green thumb industries [link](https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/overview/default.aspx). This one has been making acquisitions that have been [massive](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/13/1650439/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-Inc-GTI-Expands-with-the-Acquisition-of-Integral-Associates-Nevada-s-Top-Cannabis-Operator.html) but they aren‚Äôt stupid moves unlike some of its peers (medmen) who have spent egregious amounts on unestablished license holders. They bought a [company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/essence-cannabis-dispensary-awarded-new-licenses-to-expand-to-california-300768648.html) that afterwards won a very unique and competitive license in West Hollywood. They also won a very competitive and valuable license in [New Jersey](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/17/1668365/0/en/National-Cannabis-Company-Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Awarded-Cultivation-Processing-and-Retail-License-in-New-Jersey.html). This is the key to long term growth in the industry while maintaining shareholder value. A license can cost a few million vs buying a license holder which can cost tens of millions or hundreds of millions depending on development so whoever has the best license getters in the industry are going to be at a serious advantage for long term growth. Financials aren‚Äôt horrible compared to the rest of the sector and they are positioned well in Illinois with around 100k sq ft in grow space. Illinois just elected a pro legalization governor. Market cap is around 1.5 B. overall I trust this company and its branding efforts (rise dispensaries) to make it an established player in the market. They are however in buildout mode so financials might not look as pretty this year and dilution will be happening and therefore will see good buying opportunities this year imo. I‚Äôd be happy to pick some more up around $7.  Something to keep in mind when doing your own due diligence is these m.s.o. (Multi state operators) like to count their unbuilt licenses as if they exist. In Florida for example, it seems companies were granted 30 dispensaries by default so a lot of mso, without even building out 1, have greatly inflated their dispensary numbers. Focus on who actually has the most buildings functioning and distributing product. That will tell you who is ahead. I personally am focused on companies that dominate an area which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they will have the most dispensaries-just the best locations to saturate a market.   (CURLF) I don‚Äôt like curaleaf [link](https://content.equisolve.net/curaleaf/news/2018-11-26_Curaleaf_Reports_Third_Quarter_2018_Financial_and__29.pdf) because of overvaluation (mc around 2.5B) but it‚Äôs probably wise to pick up a piece of these guys when the opportunity arises. They were early in New Jersey which is a very attractive market and bring in significant revenue. They have 20 operational dispensaries in FL and over 650k sq ft of cultivation space across all states they operate in according to their investor presentation. It will be telling if they can make a significant dent to trulieves footprint in Florida or if they will be The Burger King to trulieves McDonalds. Trulieve has maintained over 60% of market share in Florida so I question Curaleafs potential to outcompete competitors in other states as well. They also are initiating a share [buyback](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curaleaf-announces-launch-of-share-buyback-program-300760620.html) which at this stage is a huge red flag while green thumb is acquiring serious license getters and Florida competitor trulieve is opening 6 stores in the upcoming few months. I‚Äôm looking for a strong dip in the upcoming year and might buy some around $4.  (Acrgf) Acreage has made some dumbfounding decisions that include millions of dollars of investment in the state of Iowa which has only legalized cbd and in general have fairly unattractive locations including Oregon and Maine [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/oregons-weed-glut-what-happens-to-excess-pot-697985/amp/). They also missed the boat in Florida and look a little desperate with this [acquisition](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/acreage-holdings-enters-florida-medical-cannabis-market-with-67-million-acquisition-natures-way/) made recently. Imo They are b listers from my due diligence (Burger King might be too much of a compliment) but they‚Äôre the best politically connected [link](https://m.benzinga.com/article/12716495) and are well positioned financially to be a force in the sector. Already distributing in Jersey (125k sqft cultivation facility) which is big. If I see stupid moves I stay away especially if they are already overvalued [link](http://investors.acreageholdings.com/file/Index?KeyFile=395942626) but this should definitely be on your radar (also has 100k sqft cultivation in NY) . This thing trades strong and I think a lot of big money is behind it. I will probably diversify and pick up some when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping to have an opportunity to buy around ~$12-15 because I don‚Äôt think they are deserving of a market cap of more than about 1.5B at the moment and currently are trading around a 3B market cap.  Another thing is to do your due diligence in each states cannabis economy as each is incredibly unique. Right now Oregon, Washington and Colorado are not business friendly (in terms of helping a balance sheet look nicer) even though Colorado and Washington are very attractive revenue wise. Some states limit monopolies or have no limit in dispensaries/cultivation which reduces economic upside at the moment. Maryland has a limit (cant find a link so might need to fact check me on this) on how much one company can own of the state which will be interesting to see how it‚Äôs upheld as the market merges. Cali has overtaxed everything so the black market continues to be very influential there but whoever takes the lead in this state (medmen currently) will be a formidable force as the black market slowly fades from existence. Nevada is a good economy due to limiting the licenses given out and flower prices were rising for a while. Vegas is huge from a branding perspective. Green thumb is the leader here after their big acquisition. Jersey is just getting around to implementing medical expansion (thanks to fat bastard aka Chris Christie) so companies there haven‚Äôt even capitalized on that population density yet. Most of this is really common sense and comes down to basic supply vs. demand economics. The northeast especially, where there are tons of non smokers without access to quality black market connects are going to pour hundreds of dollars into brick and mortar stores each month imo so I‚Äôm paying close attention to Mass/NJ/NY in the coming year to see who takes the lead there.   (MMNFF) Medmen is garbage and idc to go in depth on why [link](https://equity.guru/2018/05/28/medmen-goes-public-tuesday-three-executives-will-make-money-deal/). It would be a lengthy write up. They have the best market penetration in Cali so far and I do think they will be relevant in 10 years but investment potential isn‚Äôt as attractive as their peers. Insiders sold out for a reason in my opinion [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/marijuana-retailer-medmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-million-2018-10). this acquisition is going to take a decade if not more to pay off assuming it does. Just horrible mismanagement of shareholder value IMO.   (CRLBF) Cresco labs are Chicago based and have focused their efforts in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/overview/default.aspx) Management seems to be top tier but I think it‚Äôs a little pricy at the moment (~2B) for what they own. The main guy sits on a committee with newly elected Pritzker in Illinois (140k sq ft cultivation in IL) and they will be major players I think [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Cresco-Labs-Co-founder-and-CEO-Charles-Bachtell-Appointed-to-Cannabis-Legalization-Subcommittee-of-Illinoimedmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-s-Governor-elect-JB-Pritzkers-Transition-Team/default.aspx). I‚Äôm looking to diversify with these guys when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping for a chance around $5.  (ITHUF) Another interesting company is Ianthus [link](https://www.ianthuscapital.com/investors). They recently merged with MPX and imo it has legitimized their future. Ianthus holds attractive licenses in NY and FL but has no proven growth or brand perception. Mpx on The other hand has strong brand perception (although recently they‚Äôve been getting poor reviews on products) and proven growth and also holds some attractive licenses in AZ, MD, and NJ among others [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/two-new-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-coming-to-atlantic-city-vineland/article_8bceb880-437d-5d4e-ab89-7429c53d7fc5.amp.html). Together I think they will be a value buy at some point. Unfortunately both don‚Äôt have enough operating capital to fund their growth and will need funding to execute and fulfill their potential. when an opportunity presents itself I‚Äôll buy a small piece for diversification. I‚Äôm looking for sub $3 myself.  (HTHHF) There is also Harvest Health and Recreation [link](https://www.harvestinc.com/industry-experience/). Not very familiar with them but they seem to be strong license getters and have good reviews. Definitely overpriced at the moment. I‚Äôll look for a buy op under $4.    A company to look out for is Columbia Care [link](https://www.col-care.com). They have a huge presence in the northeast and have yet to go public. Won a New Jersey license recently.   (DXBRF) There is also Dixie brands [link](http://dixieelixirs.com/ir-dashboard/). This is where long term future is in the industry. Beverages are a socialized means of getting fucked up. The beverage leader will normalize getting high. Right now that‚Äôs Dixie. My concern here is this is decades away from normalizing. I don‚Äôt think the market for drinks is as attractive an investment short term as the actual infrastructure to grow the plant. Also my opinion is established brands such as Coca Cola will simply come in and have better brand recognition immediately. Nothing Dixie or any edible manufacturer is doing is necessarily a secret or patentable from my understanding so all the big beverage players have to do is hire the right people and they will immediately dominate a company like Dixie.   Something else to look out for is investor presentations and revenue forecasts. I‚Äôve seen quite a few but the one that stands out the most is acreages that was just absolute bullshit. Do not under any circumstance trust guidance from companies. I think revenues will grow slower than most will admit but the market will continue to overvalue these companies as we get closer to large capital investing in the US cannabis space. Companies that have established presence in growing markets such as Trulieve I‚Äôll trust far more than unestablished companies with poor footing like Acreage to give accurate projections. At the end of the day there are too many variables in a completely new market segment to rely on company projections.  Other ancillary companies for ‚Äúsafer‚Äù investment include Scott‚Äôs Miracle Grow (SMG) which I think will dominate the self grow industry as well as the commercial growing infrastructure based on some of their recent acquisitions. The other sector I‚Äôm somewhat familiar with is mass spectrometry. Labs to test marijuana composition are going to be a huge need and mass spectrometers and liquid chromatography will be in high demand. I know Waters (WAT) specializes in spectrometry. Also (TMO) Thermo Fisher and (PKI) PerkinElmer for laboratory needs. I haven‚Äôt actually done my due diligence on these guys financials and fundamentals though.   That‚Äôs it I think. Some smaller players exist but these are the big boys that have the most growth potential. If you have a thought, question or comment about anything I‚Äôd love to hear it, especially if you are familiar with any of these companies or have your own personal insights to share. There will likely be more relevant companies that go public so I‚Äôll keep my eyes open and let you know if I see anything worthwhile. I‚Äôm looking forward to the market consolidating when bigger money gets to join in. These are just my opinions so do your own due diligence and best of luck!  |True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|498024|public|confidence|self|Investing in Cannabis: a brief overview of a true YOLO opportunity||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/apkd46/investing_in_cannabis_a_brief_overview_of_a_true/|house_only|1|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'iU5CEQ4CbYt9ZBWyuZn8HPdo8kMErV3KQ727Hsf3I_w', 'resolutions': [{'height': 175, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gx86h45J3HRIIFD45cTT8e7SNTXIdjXsOGvqbPTyYhM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9a5e405e3783deb2e19fb3b49bdcef87900624', 'width': 108}, {'height': 350, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gx86h45J3HRIIFD45cTT8e7SNTXIdjXsOGvqbPTyYhM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efeef9883c59a2ae7ff2f8a9853adc8c5a3ed274', 'width': 216}, {'height': 518, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gx86h45J3HRIIFD45cTT8e7SNTXIdjXsOGvqbPTyYhM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9fc96fb85cbe34fc502b6d682d997802b19366', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 992, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gx86h45J3HRIIFD45cTT8e7SNTXIdjXsOGvqbPTyYhM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6d219f07d14c699af36da20a414aed36579953d1', 'width': 612}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||2019-02-11|CURLF
