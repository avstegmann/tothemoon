This is very high for the amount of shares available in the public float. 92.5M \* %10.72 = 9,916,000 shares. 9,991,600 shares times let‚Äôs say 8$ your looking at $79,328,000, and that‚Äôs if it was shorted at 8$. Total float of 92.5M @ $8 = ¬†$740,000,000. So, with this being in mind, the stock can be considered having quite a high short interest pertaining to the available public float.¬†  Please refer below (Short Volume %):  https://preview.redd.it/47hctk76nfq61.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9ad19a6761e3469fb2c936f8ae586d1051c57c8  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0obgafolnfq61.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8dc6ff2153fced2e357e83144133704f19d2963  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/6j1crpnmnfq61.jpg?width=1223&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3170189ba825df731ce562ceb3dadb13f551637  Source: Shortvolume(.)com  2) UWMC announced that they're considering a Senior Notes Offering not to be confused with Senior Debt, of $700,000,000. This is to be used to pay of their MSR and for other corporation purposes. This has both detracted some investors and attracted investors at the same time. Is this a bad thing? Not all, it‚Äôs simply a way of raising capital for the company. Think venture capital, inside investors etc. The interest rate would be locked in at %5.5 which is very low and to be paid in 2029. This is actually a smart decision depending on how you look at it to pay off debt owed with a lower and cheaper interest loan. It‚Äôs essentially, a senior convertible bond. Prominent start ups and companies expected to have high growth typically use this option as it reduces risk and lowers interest. I mean, I‚Äôm not going to go into the nitty gritty of explaining what Senior Notes are, I‚Äôm sure someone will in the comments section for those interested. Senior notes are not considered good nor bad. They can be considered bad when a company is sinking like when GM went bankrupt but would be considered good for growing companies such as UWMC who are using it to strengthen their balance sheets and grow their business. Some investors see senior notes and sell out and that is one aspect of the reason for some sell offs. (This is not something to be concerned with at all, personal opinion). The senior note was proposed but has not been finalized in any way. What does this impact to your investment and the stock price? Apart from some people selling out of the stock, it has little affect.  The 3 big factors for the stock price chilling at around high $7 - $8 currently are 1) Current bearish market 2) High short volume % 3) Senior Note announcement/consideration. (Again, this is not a negative thing).  Positive sentiments: Dividends payout in April, will be added to the the Russel 1000 &amp; 3000, if interest/inflation goes up that‚Äôs when UWMC or the wholesale channel in general actually makes more profit/revenuw than Refi companies like RKT. So, all this inflation and interest talk going around, this would actually benefit UWMC to my understanding and not go against them. It would actually make them more competitive since wholesalers/brokers provide better rates, that‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs a fact. The other biggest factors for positive sentiments is the fact that the stock is extremely undervalued, great fundamentals, and has a solid balance sheet. This isn‚Äôt a GME or an AMC, etc. This stock is a completely different play all together and a great hedge in this bearish market; that‚Äôs currently on sale at it's current price and provides high dividend payouts of %4.83 or $0.10 per share quarterly.  This is not financial advice, this is just my personal DD on the current price range UWMC is currently trading at. Have faith and patience my fellow investors and put those üíéüñê to the test. (Disclaimer: Do whatever you want, I'm personally going to üíéüñê no doubt).  I hope this proves useful to you in some way or another and that you all make a bunch of tendies. üöÄüåî  TL;DR - Stock price is being affected because of the bearish market, short interest and short volume%, and the senior notes offering announcement/consideration.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9701957|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jUJAYmX1TliLGH9arZgGXes9e_6oPi953JEewCOQ1oU.jpg|120.0|140.0|$UWMC - What's currently going on &amp; updates|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhgqnv/uwmc_whats_currently_going_on_updates/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-03-31|GM

The stock soared to $29.20 (from 13ish) before coming back to earth and settled at $21.61 at market close (on 88.56m volume vs. 32.15m float). This is still a GREAT entry point imo and still below the February high of $23.83 when the market dipped and the shorts increased... I expect the price to rise a lot this week.

PS - DFV had $HGEN on his watchlist - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnnwcy/deepfuckingvalues_potential_picks_courtesy_of_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab  **What is it?**  Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered¬Æ anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID ‚Äì patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation &lt;94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).  **How does it work?**  GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don‚Äôt matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here‚Äôs a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What‚Äôs also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn‚Äôt target the virus ‚Äì it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)  From the article: ‚ÄúGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds‚Äù  Here‚Äôs another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)  From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‚ÄêCSF might be a key feature of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2‚Äêinduced cytokine storm in COVID‚Äê19 patients""  **Does it work?**  We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I‚Äôve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more  1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--&gt; Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006) 2. An interim analysis of HGEN‚Äôs Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results ‚Äì with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/). 3. Otilimab ‚Äì a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF ‚Äì recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab‚Äôs chance of success 4. Here‚Äôs a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: ‚ÄúAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement‚Äù 5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)  Funded and selected by the NIH ‚Äì this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab‚Äôs efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial  **Competition**  \- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It‚Äôs all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted  **COVID ‚Äì getting worse**  As many of you might‚Äôve heard, COVID isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it‚Äôs new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.  How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it‚Äôs looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here‚Äôs a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, &lt;6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, &lt;8.6x  Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here‚Äôs an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis.

At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking  Outside the US market:  1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe 2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))  **Price forecasting:**  Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn‚Äôt include any non-US sales or stockpiling.  With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN‚Äôs market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.  **BONUS -&gt; HIGH SHORT INTEREST**  $HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26-&gt;Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock‚Äôs low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -&gt; more fuel for the rocket ships  **BONUS BONUS ‚Äì CAR-T implications and more**  Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID  \*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don‚Äôt want to downplay this, I think it‚Äôs very promising and I‚Äôm very bullish on it, but I‚Äôm admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There‚Äôs 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.  Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.  $HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1  **TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**  Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

The stock soared to $29.20 (from 13ish) before coming back to earth and settled at $21.61 at market close (on a ton of volume - 88.56m vs 32.15m float).  This is still a great entry point and still below their February high of $23.83 when the market dipped and the shorts increased...  Also, Humanigen recently announced that they drew the $25 million loan from Hercules Capital and suspended their ATM agreement w/ Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-8k-2021-march-29-18715-40)]. They also announced an offering of 5mil shares ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-424b5-2021-march-29-18715-832)). $HGEN is gearing up for Lenz production.   Things to look out for ahead are the full results of the P3 study, chatter re: FDA/EUA approval, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future  Posted last thursday (&lt;1bil market cap at time)... Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug **Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab  What is it?  Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered¬Æ anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID ‚Äì patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation &lt;94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).  How does it work?  GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don‚Äôt matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here‚Äôs a recent bombshell article from Science Immunology that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What‚Äôs also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn‚Äôt target the virus ‚Äì it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\#variantagnostic)  From the article: ‚ÄúGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds‚Äù  Here‚Äôs another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: Journal of Leukocyte Biology  From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‚ÄêCSF might be a key feature of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2‚Äêinduced cytokine storm in COVID‚Äê19 patients""  Does it work?  We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I‚Äôve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more  Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic --&gt; Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (P=.006)  An interim analysis of HGEN‚Äôs Phase 3 RCT (NCT04351152) showed promising results ‚Äì with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. Source.  Otilimab ‚Äì a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF ‚Äì recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab‚Äôs chance of success  Here‚Äôs a recent bullish letter to the editor from [Mayo Clinic]: ‚ÄúAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement‚Äù  ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)  Funded and selected by the NIH ‚Äì this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab‚Äôs efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial  Competition  - There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It‚Äôs all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted  COVID ‚Äì getting worse  As many of you might‚Äôve heard, COVID isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. CTV news article re: India w/ it‚Äôs new double mutant variant, CNN re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and global news re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains as this nature article shows, we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.  How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it‚Äôs looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. Here‚Äôs a study from the New England Journal of Medicine, which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, &lt;6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, &lt;8.6x  Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. Here‚Äôs an article from nature, which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab  Partnerships  Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for Operation Warp Speed (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -&gt; Source.

So much so they even changed their name to VOLTswagen!*  # Volkswagen will reportedly rebrand its US operation to 'Voltswagen of America'  All signs point to Volkswagen changing the name of its stateside operation to ""Voltswagen of America,"" according to [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html). Earlier today, the automaker prematurely published an incomplete press release to its website it planned to share on April 29th. VW quickly took down the announcement, but not before *CNBC* managed to get a good look at it.  A Volkswagen spokesperson declined to comment on the release, but a source ""familiar with the company's plans"" told the network the document was authentic. The release characterized the rebranding as a ""public declaration of the company's future-forward investment in e-mobility."" The change will reportedly see Volkswagen EVs feature a badge that bears the new Voltswagen branding and a lighter blue VW logo. Any gas-powered cars the company sells moving forward will feature only the classic VW emblem in the automaker's signature dark blue color.  Traditional automakers have been all about EV-centric rebrandings in recent months. In January, GM [redid its classic logo](https://www.engadget.com/gm-logo-branding-electric-vehicles-210607845.html) to evoke ""the clean skies of a zero-emissions future."" The new design is also a visual play on the company's [Ultium battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html). For Volkswagen, the change would come at a pivotal point in its history. The company plans to offer [300 EV models by 2030](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-volkswagen-wants-300-ev-models-by-2030.html) and get to a point where at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in Europe are either hybrids or battery electrics.

Let me go through how I got to these conclusions and you can see if you agree. I‚Äôll try to avoid too much pop psychology, but man this guy‚Ä¶it‚Äôll be hard.   &amp;#x200B;  Buckle up, this is gonna be looooong.  &amp;#x200B;  **Quick Background: The Early Years**  Fisker has a Degree in transportation design from the Art Center College of Design in Switzerland. Rock start vehicle designer with BMW and Aston Martin where he designed the Z8, X5, DB9, and V8 Vantage. \[1\]  Design experience, but doesn‚Äôt show any connection to vehicle dynamics, engineering, or manufacturing.  Does some work with/for Tesla back in 2007. Gets sued for allegedly only taking the job to steal confidential information to be able to start his own company ‚Äì Fisker Automotive. Fisker wins in arbitration, with a finding that he did nothing wrong. \[1\] I mention this not to throw shade (he won the arbitration after all), just to introduce his connection to Elon Musk and Tesla. This connection seems an unavoidable thread through his work at Fisker Automotive which would have directly competed with Tesla.  **Chapter 1: Fisker Automotive (the first one)**  Henrik Fisker created his first car company. Named it after himself (not a glaring red flag since it‚Äôs his first company, but remember this for later). Created a car ‚Äì the Fisker Karma ‚Äì that was beautiful, but an engineering disaster.   The most publicized issue was batteries that would catch on fire. But this wasn‚Äôt the only problem. ‚ÄúPressure on engineers to stay faithful to Henrik Fisker‚Äôs original design, even when flaws emerged that undercut the Karma‚Äôs performance and potential fixes would add millions in cost.‚Äù \[2\]. These flaws included an exhaust system for the hybrid ICE that pointed forwards. The Exhaust. Pointed. Forward. And Fisker wouldn‚Äôt let anyone change it.  ‚ÄúOn more than one occasion, Fisker asked suppliers to hand-build certain components for the Karma, which increased the cost as much as threefold‚Äù \[2\]  ‚ÄúThe company churned through three battery suppliers in three years. As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts ‚Äònot necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price‚Ä¶but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.‚Äô‚Äù \[3\]  ‚ÄúAs the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn‚Äôt even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.‚Äù \[3\]  ‚Äú‚ÄôBeneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,‚Äô said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.‚Äù \[2\]  ‚ÄúFrom 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.‚Äù \[2\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023).   This was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That‚Äôs got to hurt.  So, man that‚Äôs a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶  **Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**  His next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you \[Fisker\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL‚Ä¶VLF‚Ä¶VL‚Ä¶VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the ‚ÄúF‚Äù for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \[4\]  As promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \[4\]  Q: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?  A: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.  Q: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?  A: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.  It‚Äôs a short back and forth, but there‚Äôs a lot in there to unpack. I just don‚Äôt have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn‚Äôt sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure.   Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems.   ‚ÄúWe have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world‚Äôs longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.‚Äù \[4\].   Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware.   He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.  ‚ÄúWe also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that‚Äôs pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.‚Äù \[4\]  He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I‚Äôll refer to his ‚Äúvaporcars‚Äù.   **Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)**   Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We‚Äôre going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates.   In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017.   So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mainly been dismissed for automotive because it‚Äôs very expensive to make, it doesn‚Äôt have the power, and it doesn‚Äôt work below zero,‚Äù said Fisker. ‚ÄúWe have cracked all three of these areas.‚Äù \[5\]  In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]  ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a lab test; we‚Äôve actually built the batteries,‚Äù \[5\]  They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:  ‚ÄúTo date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved‚ÄîDyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson‚Äîhave demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.‚Äù \[7\]  From the same article: ‚ÄúBut it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.‚Äù \[7\]  Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. ‚ÄúFor now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. ‚ÄúWe are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.‚Äù He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.‚Äù \[8\]  By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\].   2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?  **Chapter 4: Foxconn**  File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled ‚ÄúPear‚Äù concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of ‚ÄúApple‚Äù in the press? This truly baffles me.   **Chapter 5: I‚Äôm Exhausted**  I‚Äôm so tired of writing this, I‚Äôd be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik‚Äôs wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there‚Äôs an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the Chief Technology Officer (who is not a board member).   **Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**  I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla‚Äôs declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that‚Äôs at the lot down the road.  &amp;#x200B;  Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can‚Äôt decide what value they add other than the name on the front.   &amp;#x200B;  As always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice.

As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts ‚Äònot necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price‚Ä¶but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.‚Äô‚Äù \[3\]  ‚ÄúAs the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn‚Äôt even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.‚Äù \[3\]  ‚Äú‚ÄôBeneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,‚Äô said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.‚Äù \[2\]  ‚ÄúFrom 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.‚Äù \[2\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023).   This was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That‚Äôs got to hurt.  So, man that‚Äôs a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶  **Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**  His next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you \[Fisker\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL‚Ä¶VLF‚Ä¶VL‚Ä¶VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the ‚ÄúF‚Äù for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \[4\]  As promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \[4\]  Q: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?  A: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.  Q: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?  A: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.  It‚Äôs a short back and forth, but there‚Äôs a lot in there to unpack. I just don‚Äôt have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn‚Äôt sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure.   Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems.   ‚ÄúWe have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world‚Äôs longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.‚Äù \[4\].   Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware.   He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.  ‚ÄúWe also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that‚Äôs pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.‚Äù \[4\]  He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I‚Äôll refer to his ‚Äúvaporcars‚Äù.   **Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)**   Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We‚Äôre going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates.   In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017.   So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mainly been dismissed for automotive because it‚Äôs very expensive to make, it doesn‚Äôt have the power, and it doesn‚Äôt work below zero,‚Äù said Fisker. ‚ÄúWe have cracked all three of these areas.‚Äù \[5\]  In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]  ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a lab test; we‚Äôve actually built the batteries,‚Äù \[5\]  They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:  ‚ÄúTo date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved‚ÄîDyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson‚Äîhave demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.‚Äù \[7\]  From the same article: ‚ÄúBut it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.‚Äù \[7\]  Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. ‚ÄúFor now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. ‚ÄúWe are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.‚Äù He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.‚Äù \[8\]  By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\].   2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?  **Chapter 4: Foxconn**  File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled ‚ÄúPear‚Äù concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of ‚ÄúApple‚Äù in the press? This truly baffles me.   **Chapter 5: I‚Äôm Exhausted**  I‚Äôm so tired of writing this, I‚Äôd be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik‚Äôs wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there‚Äôs an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the CTO (who is not a board member).   **Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**  I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla‚Äôs declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that‚Äôs at the lot down the road.  Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can‚Äôt decide what value they add other than the name on the front.   &amp;#x200B;  As always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice.

Your critiques and judgements are HIGHLY sought after by me; did I do enough DD? Was there more things I could have talked about? Lemme know. Lengthy post so I hope it helps and you enjoy...  &amp;#x200B;  NOTE: I am NOT a professional investor and this is not meant to be professional investment advice. I always HIGHLY suggest you do your own DD and research yourself, and hopefully you will come to the same conclusion that I have. I like the stock... I hope you do too...  Current analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value ""on the street."" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...  First let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...  &amp;#x200B;  \* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)  \* They are NOT a ""phone company.""  \* They are NOT, however, totally ""out of the phone business."" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.  &amp;#x200B;  This last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...  &amp;#x200B;  Though BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:  ""As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.""  This last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?  &amp;#x200B;  Okay, so India... It's a country on the ""other side of the world,"" why should we care?  &amp;#x200B;  It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...  Though BB DID ""officially"" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name ""BlackBerry Mobile.""  &amp;#x200B;  Now, what does this have to do with the ""validity"" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:  A few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.  Looks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!  &amp;#x200B;  Enough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB ""liking the stock"") for a minute...  BlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...  In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!  Sheesh, I didn't know that!  Here's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:  ""38,000+ patents  18 major development centers in 7 countries  I wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.  &amp;#x200B;  NINETY...  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  You gotta be %$%&amp;# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??  I'll let you ponder that point for a minute...  &amp;#x200B;  So, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home?   But wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?  Well, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:  ""which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.""  CARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!  &amp;#x200B;  Now, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...  Articles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...  Ha ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford‚Äôs current technology systems and touch screens.  So what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.  Two things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):  One, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership ""unique"" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.  Two, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since ""the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.""  So in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...  READ BETWEEN THE LINES....  &amp;#x200B;  Finally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...  As of June 2020, ""its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today."" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)  What sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... ""Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry¬Æ QNX¬Æ software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.""  &amp;#x200B;  Shit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...  One thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their ""day in the sun."" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...  ""BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.""  This is freakin' HUGE... ""BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees."" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)  &amp;#x200B;  March brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating ""BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery‚Äôs Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.""  to the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.  Add to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.  &amp;#x200B;  However, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...  All in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.  &amp;#x200B;  (Please note; all direct quotes from sources include """" so you know I'm not paraphrasing, but including actual research data given word for word from the original sources."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9557323|public|confidence|self|||My first DD post about BlackBerry...|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5x5o5/my_first_dd_post_about_blackberry/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-03-16|GM

They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.  They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don‚Äôt care if they are right or wrong on their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù because they will profit on their short position regardless.  Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float ‚Äì these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their ‚Äúreports‚Äù).  Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM ‚Äì to name a few.  &amp;#x200B;  **Where do they get their research?**  This is the million-dollar question.  They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.  In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on ‚Äúconversations they had‚Äù with undisclosed ‚Äúformer employees‚Äù of the company.  Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.  That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don‚Äôt imagine she‚Äôs going to have too many nice things to say.  &amp;#x200B;  **Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**  Let‚Äôs be clear. This is no Nikola.  Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.   Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a ‚Äúquiet-period‚Äù right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.  Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [‚Äúthorough‚Äù statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.  &amp;#x200B;  **In summary:**  I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.  In addition, I‚Äôll let you be the judge ‚Äì should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?  What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.   I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.  &amp;#x200B;  **I‚Äôll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?**   A 5-man ‚Äúresearch firm‚Äù ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious.   Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn‚Äôt close out their short positions get burned this week ‚Äì and it begins tomorrow.  $RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR;**  Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place ‚Äì for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first **full-size** electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9538687|public|confidence|self|||Who do us apes hate even more than shorts?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5300l/who_do_us_apes_hate_even_more_than_shorts/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'HWvmpi2qCd1sQbpOBO4msMn1CzFaWLGPs-u47BIQvcg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b97f648f1e352f9da54db1693a7547d45d0be0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d6ba323c0050f91dc10083aa16e19636be52921', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc56cc1e8c755633895fa70ac7a3acaf5ca13578', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e1e3f854130d216d2d2f3f0b96656b853bfb916', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa659b7dfb55a015397e9d7377d849cc3a18c9c5', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403f4e7440cbcf9e244c78701265a6c88da87453', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=62aec43d69e3f0dbf2f9392ab235cfe31950a44e', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-03-14|GM

They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don‚Äôt care if they are right or wrong on their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù because they will profit on their short position regardless.  Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float ‚Äì these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their ‚Äúreports‚Äù).  Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM, $IDEX, $CODX ‚Äì to name a few.  &amp;#x200B;  **Where do they get their research?**  This is the million-dollar question.  They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.  In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on ‚Äúconversations they had‚Äù with undisclosed ‚Äúformer employees‚Äù of the company.  Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.  That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don‚Äôt imagine she‚Äôs going to have too many nice things to say.  &amp;#x200B;  **Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**  Let‚Äôs be clear. This is no Nikola.  Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.   Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a ‚Äúquiet-period‚Äù right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.  Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [‚Äúthorough‚Äù statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.  &amp;#x200B;  **In summary:**  I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.  In addition, I‚Äôll let you be the judge ‚Äì should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?  What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.   I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.  &amp;#x200B;  **I‚Äôll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?**   A 5-man ‚Äúresearch firm‚Äù ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious.   Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn‚Äôt close out their short positions get burned this week ‚Äì and it begins tomorrow.  $RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR;**  Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place ‚Äì for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first **full-size** electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9538667|public|confidence|self|||Who do us apes hate even more than shorts?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m52xtv/who_do_us_apes_hate_even_more_than_shorts/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'HWvmpi2qCd1sQbpOBO4msMn1CzFaWLGPs-u47BIQvcg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b97f648f1e352f9da54db1693a7547d45d0be0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d6ba323c0050f91dc10083aa16e19636be52921', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc56cc1e8c755633895fa70ac7a3acaf5ca13578', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e1e3f854130d216d2d2f3f0b96656b853bfb916', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa659b7dfb55a015397e9d7377d849cc3a18c9c5', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403f4e7440cbcf9e244c78701265a6c88da87453', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=62aec43d69e3f0dbf2f9392ab235cfe31950a44e', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-03-14|GM

A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.  First off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.  This hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess  1) there is no demand. Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.  3) the truck doesn't work There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.  5) preorders are fake No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.  This report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.  The bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday  1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.  2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity  3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.  4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.  5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together  Finally  6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.  Thanks for reading my ted talk I typed this on my phone so fuck you if there are any typos I'm not fixing that shit.  $RIDE TO THE MOON THEN MARS THEN PLUTO"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9536635|public|confidence|self|||$RIDE with me: DD, Lordstown|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4vmzg/ride_with_me_dd_lordstown/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-03-14|GM

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.  # **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction. ***** &gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower. ***** &gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month. ***** &gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday. ***** &gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023. ***** &gt; # Fed ahead &gt; ‚ÄúThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,‚Äù said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. ‚ÄúI think the message is going to be consistent.‚Äù ***** &gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy. ***** &gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy. ***** &gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks. ***** &gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% ‚Äî its highest level in more than a year. ***** &gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year ‚Äî deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,‚Äù said Peters of PGIM. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there‚Äôs going to be pressure on rates moving higher.‚Äù ***** &gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12. ***** &gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals &gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%. ***** &gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhen rates are very low, valuations don‚Äôt matter to people,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf rates are low, there‚Äôs no penalty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen here.‚Äù ***** &gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he‚Äôs found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe names that I‚Äôm in ‚Äî Visa, GM, Ford, Macy‚Äôs, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.‚Äù ***** &gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,‚Äù Redler said. ‚ÄúLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‚ÄòWas that it?‚Äô‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday‚Äôs lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.‚Äù ***** &gt; Apple‚Äôs stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market‚Äôs gains last year. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWatch Apple because it‚Äôs a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,‚Äù Redler said. ***** &gt; # Bond volatility &gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February‚Äôs retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday. ***** &gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed. ***** &gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank‚Äôs leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending. ***** &gt; The program expires March 31. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,‚Äù Peters of PGIM said. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe markets are kind of divided on what‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.‚Äù ***** &gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see these whippy moves.‚Äù *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fkwT5RT.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MuJ7SlC.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lQiMjAN.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hvH8uj8.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ojOPNgp.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OtOIN5B.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AUXbpnZ.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sptpE1X.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hb2eNGo.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13  &gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.  &gt; March‚Äôs option expiration week performance is second only to December‚Äôs and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ‚Äôs track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March‚Äôs quarterly options expiration.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?  &gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.  &gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; While we don‚Äôt think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. ‚ÄúWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.‚Äù  &gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.  *****  &gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March  &gt; We‚Äôve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market‚Äôs technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior ‚Äì and likely to do so for some time to come.  &gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.  &gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today‚Äôs stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week‚Äôs technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.  &gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.  &gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Versatile Outperformers  &gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**  &gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # FedEx Corp. $270.20 **FedEx Corp.

It should climate focused considering that the Biden administration ran on that message. One of Biden‚Äôs initiatives was building a network of charging station across America. Another one is making modern changes to the power grid system and alternative ways to harness energy. Of courses the materials to build these priorities takes steel and fuel.  Based on these assumptions mixed in with a few facts about the materials that will be used to modernize our infrastructure, as other analysts have reiterated, this is a great year for energy and materials. They like to think about the reopening which I think is short-sighted. The real growth will come from the rumor out of Congress. That‚Äôs going to be the accelerant for a lot of these alternative energy stocks.  Here are some on my watch list: MP Materials Star Peak Energy (soon to be STEM this month) ChargePoint  MP Materials   ‚Ä¢ Not a fan all too much for this one, and it has a competitive advantage that‚Äôs also its greatest weakness. They are the only rare earth material miner in the US. It only takes a competitor with lower prices to soak up their market share. A little apprehensive about this one but I like their team. Maybe you guys have more information on what makes this one stellar.  Star Peak Energy   ‚Ä¢ This one is a good one in my opinion for its uniqueness. Other green tech stocks in its sector are trading at much much higher multiples like Blink whereas this company is only 8x. So, it‚Äôs trading at a discount from its peers. They offer energy solutions driven by their patented AI system Athena to harness power from energy storage units. They also plan to be cash flow positive by 2022-2023. That‚Äôs beside the point though, they‚Äôre pioneering great sustainable technology and already have a 75% market share in California in energy storage. I like this one a lot. They‚Äôre planning a merger with Stem this month and it will be listed in the NYSE as STEM.   ChargePoint   ‚Ä¢ The company has the widest distribution of charging units across the country. Though they aren‚Äôt as good as other chargers in their sector, they have them at scale. This play is largely contingent on the infrastructure bill. GM plans to have like 30 EV cars by 2025, so just imagine the growth story for this stock. Even at its current multiple, I can honestly say that Biden‚Äôs proposal is not factored in. They‚Äôre going to be met with more demand than they projected in a few years as more and more people embrace EV‚Äôs.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9528326|public|confidence|self|||Green-Centric Technology Set to Benefit from Infrastructure Spending|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m45rkh/greencentric_technology_set_to_benefit_from/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-03-13|GM

Betting on $RIDE is betting on America and on progress.  LORDSTOWN MOTORS ($RIDE)  Okay, fellow retards and all you true autists out there, listen up. I never make time to do this but I'm about to share some DD that leads me to believe that $RIDE is a strong buy right now.  I believe that $RIDE's current share price ($14.95 currently) potentially holds some--dare I say--deep fucking value to those that start getting in now at current prices. I've been meaning to do some DD on Lordstown for a while now. I've been on it since its pre-merger spac days and am LONG. Today's Hindenberg report was some serious bullshit, in my opinion, and a clear example of the kind of shit Cramer told us happens all the time. I am sure someone paid them for the take down in order to help calls in the $15+ range expiring they worthless. As we speak, there has been a battle to keep it below $15 for the past hour or two. It looks like RIDE just broke through, but the activity the stock today is NOT normal. I've been following this stock literally since before its inception, and its current price is the second lowest since merger, not since Oct 30 did it dip lower once, and it has surpassed $30 per share already on more than one occasion. Seeing it knocked down to $15 and below caused me write this shit up, because I think $15 is a STEAL and potential ten bagger as time goes on, if you go in long on it as I am. Even in the short term, I think calls will be printing and it was veryyyy interesting to see that despite the price drop today, premiums on my 3/26 otm calls went UP. There is some short action fuckery afoot, it would seem. But that's not the reason I'm bullish, as I've been bullish since its inception.  In my opinion, there is a reason why rating agencies (I think Morgan Stanley, iirc) recently downgraded RIDE and why the Hindenberg report dropped this morning. Hedge funds/big money/MM/whoever wanted this stock down today and calls not to print. But that‚Äôs all beside the point ‚Äì back to the bigger picture.  My point is: BUY $RIDE and if you want to RIDE its eventual (if not imminent) return to $30 and beyond. $15 for RIDE is ridiculous. Its the only yet-to-sell-a-car US-based EV company that will actually be rolling thousands of units off the lines THIS YEAR. They have a large, former GM plant (as well as having big GM backing/investment), located right in the fuckin heartland of the USA in blue collar Ohio (which makes the company's badass name even more badass‚ÄîLordstown is actually the name of the city). The cars come from LORD'Stown, i.e. God's Country.  Aside from Lordstown being a cool name, more importantly, they have allies in Congress. It‚Äôs located in Rep. Tim Ryan‚Äôs district, and he is fighting for them. $RIDE will be bringing back jobs and helping to revitalize the area as it expands.  These articles talk in more detail about these issues and explains shit better than I can:  [https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac)  And to top it all off, they have Joe Fuckin' Burrow as the company spokesman ‚Äì with a pretty good ad campaign and marketing vision, I must say: [https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow)  Oh, by the way, Tim Ryan has already been pumping $RIDE to ~~Grampa~~ President Biden, and the talk is of America's ""Steel Valley"" to rapidly become America's ""Voltage Valley"": [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/rep-tim-ryan-invites-president-biden-to-visit-lordstown-motors-attend-voltage-valley-roundtable/ar-BB1d9xYh](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/rep-tim-ryan-invites-president-biden-to-visit-lordstown-motors-attend-voltage-valley-roundtable/ar-BB1d9xYh)  Need I say more!!? $RIDE is going to unite Blue and Red America as we embark on this EV revolution, by providing the first mass-produced electric pickup trucks this year. Hop upon this $RIDE to American EV dominance glory! It's a story of rebirth of the American Rustbelt. A rebirth of the shuttered Lordstown GM plant.

I think GM has more gas left in the tank even after this run.  I took this gain because the size of position had grown and with the expiration next week I decided to lock this in, as well as I'm transferring out of Interactive Brokers.  I still have 20 more calls (also shown below) that I'll try to press to a $60 strike before closing/rolling that position.  My basic premise is that while most are viewing GM's rise as an EV play, the share gains are actually because of Boomer metrics.  GM is producing too much cash and growing earnings too much to have a dying industrial PE multiple.  They're sandbagging earnings and have a history of such.  When they beat earnings again next quarter, GM will moon, again.  You don't have to view GM as a Tesla rival to have tendies print now because of large SUV's.  **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**  [5K to 25K](https://preview.redd.it/po667pscjmm61.png?width=712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c97dbcfe27a430991229587e8199ad1925498e5)  And the gains I'm still hoping to build on (or will roll next week regardless as there's more tendies to come):  &amp;#x200B;  [Moar Tendies!](https://preview.redd.it/mj033h0qkmm61.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b014b62082f6ad3de456e2086f46c11f7cae6faf)  Tendies in the bank.

Don‚Äôt you love how everything acquired from Lordstown is done so efficiently?  Meanwhile,  JPMORGAN gave a bearish hit piece out right AT the moment Lordstown‚Äôs stock was at the tripple top on the chart.  EXACTLY AT IT :  They bought the dip.  Biden slipped in one of his first economic going electric announcements regarding the ‚Äúretooling‚Äù loan him and Obama did to bail out auto... ... when that loan was themed around WAGEs not tooling.   ‚Äî- Just so happens, Lordstown has applied for a tooling loan, ‚Äúthe same kind tesla got‚Äù.. putting the project ‚Äúon steroids‚Äù... Burns said.  unit economics should be ridiculous with 15000 less parts, costing less to buy &amp; own..  The hub motors is the only thing all the EV‚Äôs don‚Äôt have and IS IT not interesting how ARK invest is diamond handing Workhorse as they are the one who made the deal with Lordstown to use that technology for a percentage of the co and 1% of each endurance profit?   I feel like if WKHS gets the bid (ya that‚Äôs still a thing actually) Lordstown might just merge with them and those 250+ patents on Drones. done editing this rant...  The 6 CEO‚Äôs that we‚Äôre once listed on Ride‚Äôs site have since been taken off the site, are globally ready to fight the good fight and GM must have known it.. here you go let‚Äôs help set up all our equipment with you and give you a loan you already paid off for the 2nd biggest factory in the automotive industry..  They‚Äôre going to need more factories... aside from 2nd biggest battery plant there too.. tesla being 1st.  There‚Äôs much to the story we don‚Äôt know. Like in Jack Spencer‚Äôs interview where Burns was talking about the 100k preorders foreshadowing it does not include municipalities, gov, Fed, police, town, state vehicle orders.. ya know the ones Biden says he‚Äôll be replacing their vehicles with..  The race mid April.  (They can make the batteries go as long as they want it to)  Safety ratings coming. The started from the bottom now we here story line.  Pandemic born Endurance.. The Q2/Q3 van/Camping World RV prototype ... the Solar Panels powering the factory even.. The clear lane of all EV work trucks untapped.  It‚Äôs performance .. doesn‚Äôt even belong in the segment it‚Äôs going to be compared with its advantages and is 17k less.. the wheel technology can move sideways.. but no one is talking about that yet also.  Oshkosh bid has been halted.  Good thing the Dems really hammered down postmaster during the pre vote setting the stage for what we all already knew.. no not just Workhorse, they‚Äòre going to need to do something to make them look good.   And Has any other EV‚Äôs visited the White House? It‚Äôs had and always will be about the money, so don‚Äôt get political, it‚Äôs a waste of everyone‚Äôs energy and is racist. Why is JPMORGAN bashing Lordstown and pumping Fisker and Goldman doing vise-versa??  Look at the Short interest on the closest 1st to Market all EV 0 emissions fleet Truck..   Buy that dip. ‚ÄúWork for it‚Äù that‚Äôll be a fine narrative to the unemployed after getting our country highjacked on a super flu and the media is going to need to start shouting something positive after all the garbage they‚Äôve been feeding for so long... and to be honest Steve Burn (co founder of Workhorse, CEO of Lordstown) earns it.  These are good people, in a good community, working on a worthy project, and they love what they do and work hard on doing it.  Like.. the DD you‚Äôre welcome to do, it‚Äôs all there.

During the 2008 crisis GM nearly went bankrupt, if it wasn‚Äôt saved by Obama, it could very well ceased to exist. During the 2020 crisis you would expect the auto industry to be severely affected, specially a manufacturer that makes cars that are more expensive that average.  Yet, Tesla was THE stock of 2020 and I feel like an idiot for not buying.  There are companies that produce MORE evs than Tesla, so Tesla isn‚Äôt even the largest EV manufacturer. What has been driving it‚Äôs near infinite growth? Is it over hyped? Will it stabilize at some price or will it keep having near infinite growth forever?  If I enter now, will my investment have infinite growth like it had on 2020? Or will it more or less stabilize? Is it over hyped?

Don‚Äôt you love how everything acquired from Lordstown is done so efficiently?  Meanwhile,  JPMORGAN gave a bearish hit piece out right AT the moment Lordstown‚Äôs stock was at the tripple top on the chart.  EXACTLY AT IT :  They bought the dip.  Biden slipped in one of his first economic going electric announcements regarding the ‚Äúretooling‚Äù loan him and Obama did to bail out auto... ... when that loan was themed around WAGEs not tooling.   ‚Äî- Just so happens, Lordstown has applied for a tooling loan, ‚Äúthe same kind tesla got‚Äù.. putting the project ‚Äúon steroids‚Äù... Burns said.  unit economics should be ridiculous with 15000 less parts, costing less to buy &amp; own..  The hub motors is the only thing all the EV‚Äôs don‚Äôt have and IS IT not interesting how ARK invest is diamond handing Workhorse as they are the one who made the deal with Lordstown to use that technology for a percentage of the co and 1% of each endurance profit?   I feel like if WKHS gets the bid (ya that‚Äôs still a thing actually) Lordstown might just merge with them and those 250+ patents on Drones. done editing this rant...  The 6 CEO‚Äôs that we‚Äôre once listed on Ride‚Äôs site have since been taken off the site, are globally ready to fight the good fight and GM must have known it.. here you go let‚Äôs help set up all our equipment with you and give you a loan you already paid off for the 2nd biggest factory in the automotive industry..  They‚Äôre going to need more factories... aside from 2nd biggest battery plant there too.. tesla being 1st.  There‚Äôs much to the story we don‚Äôt know. Like in Jack Spencer‚Äôs interview where Burns was talking about the 100k preorders foreshadowing it does not include municipalities, gov, Fed, police, town, state vehicle orders.. ya know the ones Biden says he‚Äôll be replacing their vehicles with..  The race mid April.  (They can make the batteries go as long as they want it to)  Safety ratings coming. The started from the bottom now we here story line.  Pandemic born Endurance.. The Q2/Q3 van/Camping World RV prototype ... the Solar Panels powering the factory even.. The clear lane of all EV work trucks untapped.  It‚Äôs performance .. doesn‚Äôt even belong in the segment it‚Äôs going to be compared with its advantages and is 17k less.. the wheel technology can move sideways.. but no one is talking about that yet also.  Oshkosh bid has been halted.  Good thing the Dems really hammered down postmaster during the pre vote setting the stage for what we all already knew.. no not just Workhorse, they‚Äòre going to need to do something to make them look good.   And Has any other EV‚Äôs visited the White House? It‚Äôs had and always will be about the money, so don‚Äôt get political, it‚Äôs a waste of everyone‚Äôs energy and is racist. Why is JPMORGAN bashing Lordstown and pumping Fisker and Goldman doing vise-versa??  Look at the Short interest on the closest 1st to Market all EV 0 emissions fleet Truck..   Buy that dip. ‚ÄúWork for it‚Äù that‚Äôll be a fine narrative to the unemployed after getting our country highjacked on a super flu and the media is going to need to start shouting something positive after all the garbage they‚Äôve been feeding for so long... and to be honest Steve Burn (co founder of Workhorse, CEO of Lordstown) earns it.  These are good people, in a good community, working on a worthy project, and they love what they do and work hard on doing it.  Like.. the DD you‚Äôre welcome to do, it‚Äôs all there. If you‚Äôd like to buy Tesla‚Äôs competitor in the EV sector take a good look at this ride.. rumor has it they‚Äôll be working together too.

So far I have settled on $F (current holdings 1,630 shares at $12.90) following some encouraging review on market analysis in comparison with other competitors. What I've found tonight is an interesting correlation which I would love to get everyone's input on.      [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/F:NYSE?comparison=NYSE%3AGM%2CNASDAQ%3ATSLA&amp;window=6M](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/F:NYSE?comparison=NYSE%3AGM%2CNASDAQ%3ATSLA&amp;window=6M)     My observaiton is that rate of growth for three major EV players in the USA is basically on par over the past 6 months. $TSLA's correlation seems to have brought it right in line. Now this may just be coincidental but $F is moving almost toe to toe with $GM but as of late has certainly picked up relative to it. This comparison tonight has added confidence to my choice. Who else is long on $F to ride the EV revolution with this tried and true purebread American company??|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9500081|public|confidence|self|||[Serious] Thoughts on this correlation|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2j0ge/serious_thoughts_on_this_correlation/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'k8Ncz_lf8VvxxGurpgs-Wpwk9Nvp_7YZfNtpydUhMi8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16870a63837bb41615214d0c25236711280bfaab', 'width': 108}, {'height': 112, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abede2b06b3b2762a1556dfee52014a6118917bc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ab88a21d6958b8ac89336b56b7373008924ef3', 'width': 320}, {'height': 334, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4766927f2f73d2471e4356d0e9dae56d55afd568', 'width': 640}, {'height': 501, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2c98aab44930f5e86f62d3ea8268bb3c80c0384', 'width': 960}, {'height': 564, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d608287c07727cb1612a7dbc03dfb19232d08b5e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 792, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/gtqaJXcpsNiDm4XJymdgXna01S1ofkm4TaZrTJrU5y8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b9ac4bb75cc79f097df7b47820159fc99bd3877a', 'width': 1515}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-03-11|GM

Becomes a Tesla Fleet Partner**  **GlobeNewswire**  10:13 AM ET  EVmo, Inc, formerly YayYo, Inc (""EVmo"" or the ""Company"") (OTC:YAYO), a leading provider of vehicles to the rideshare and delivery gig economy industry, acting through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rideshare Car Rentals, LLC, today announced that it is partaking in a fleet acquisition of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles, and has committed to go all electric by year end of 2021.     Steven Sanchez, CEO of EVmo said, ""The future of mobility is electric. Tesla is an obvious choice and we are excited to be one of the first Tesla rideshare fleet partners in the US that will deploy electric vehicles rather than gasoline-powered vehicles, for services like Uber and Lyft. Our EV commitment provides outsized climate benefits. The explosive growth in the gig economy and evidence that it's cann ibalizing more climate-friendly mass transit makes it important for EVmo to go all electric. There are a small number of electric vehicles used by drivers, yet electric vehicle adoption is on the rise. We recognize that the timing is right to go electric. The environmental and emission reduction benefits are high for electric vehicle usage by gig economy drivers and we want to be a catalyst for that transition.""     In recent press, rideshare companies and carmakers are increasing the number of electric vehicles used in the transportation industry. Both Uber and Lyft announced they are going 100% electric vehicles on their platform. General Motors plans to completely phase out vehicles using internal combustion engines by 2035, More than half of GM's capital spending and product development team wil l be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs. Ford, VW and Volvo are making a serious play in electric as well. But it's Tesla that is the unparalleled EV market leader in the world that makes the product such an excellent strategic choice.     Further, Mr. Sanchez stated, ""We are confident our all electric fleet will drive a successful business model for the future, becoming the first to exclusively deploy electric vehicles (EVs) for the gig economy will position us as a leader in the space and is a natural evolution from our mixed energy fleet. As previously announced, the company deployed 40 electric vehicles (EVs) in December of 2020, as part of a car-sharing program in LA. Since then, we acquired 12 EV's in February of 2021, and discovered there was a strong demand for them . We were encouraged that they rented quickly. Drivers have given great reviews, and are finding the charging easy. Not only did they save money on gas, which is their biggest cost, they received an additional $0.50 directly from a $1.00 rider surcharge for every Uber Green trip completed. Drivers also found that there was sufficient range and ample charging stations in the LA market where the vehicles were launched. And most importantly, it did not limit the number of rides or deliveries. To diversify our EV fleet, we tested the market with Hyundai Kona Electric units, which offers solid tech and safety features at only $10 more a day for drivers, it more than covered the gas savings."" Sanchez continued, ""By EVmo's acquisition and deployment of electric vehicles, drivers did not have higher up-front costs compared to them having to purchase EV's. We have 10 Tesla Model 3's and more Hyundai Kona's being delivered in the next few weeks and there are plans to establish our EV fleet f urther through the ordering of more Tesla Model 3's. We plan on using future funding and resources in a way that supports our EV future plans.     Sanchez continued, ""The Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus is highest rated in every category. It offers Tesla prestige at a lower price, is most technologically advanced and is best in class on range, performance and handling. Equally important is the Tesla supercharger network access. With a range at 263 miles, Tesla Model 3 makes it affordable and profitable for both the driver and us. The drivers get the benefits of the gas savings; plus, they can drive at a higher level both Uber and Lyft's platform, where they can earn more money.""   EVmo, Inc. (formerly YayYo, Inc.)     EVmo, Inc. bridges the gap between rideshare drivers in need of a suitable vehicle and rideshare companies that depend on attracting and keeping drivers. Rideshare Rental uniquely supports drivers in higher and lower economic categories with innovative vehicle offerings and programs. Rideshare Rental is a leading provider of rental vehicles to drivers in the gig economy.     Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rideshare Car Rentals, LLC, is an online rideshare vehicle booking platform created to service the rideshar ing, delivery gig economy and the logistics market place, which includes both our owned-fleet vehicles and third party fleet vehicles. Distinct Cars LLC, our other wholly-owned subsidiary, maintains a fleet of vehicles that are commercially available for rent by gig-economy drivers and the logistics market place.   Rideshare Rental provides SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases about our financial performance on the investor relations section of our website (EVmo.com)     About Tesla     Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn't need to compromise to drive electric - that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.     Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world's first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up - Model S - which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world's expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk's ""Secret Master Plan,"" in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever - Tesla Semi - which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.   Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla's safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.     To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla's automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 - a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.     And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy prod uction. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful - that's the future we want.

The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.

The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** ""  But what about EV's in General.

But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.  Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.  Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.

""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""  He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.  Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?  Why am I breathing hard?  I just got done moving some goalposts.  What might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.  This shit is wild.

Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.  1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one. 2. Tesla has massive brand awareness. 3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \* 4. Affordability is coming.\* 5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \* 6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \* 7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*  We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.

But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.  Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.  Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.

Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""  He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.   Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?  To move some goal posts what might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.

Backed by the CCP  ‚ÄúGenerally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.‚Äù - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))  The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.  &amp;#x200B;  2. Reasons for recent price movements  There are two causes for the recent price movements, and neither of them are particularly valid. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:  * Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3 * Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3 * Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3 * Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3  While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts‚Äô expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.  The second potential cause of $NIO‚Äôs decline is that it‚Äôs just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))  &amp;#x200B;  3. Market Cap compared to competitors  $NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly.   &amp;#x200B;  4. Potential for future growth  Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO‚Äôs, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn‚Äôt unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.  $NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j  &amp;#x200B;  5. The actual products  In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can‚Äôt do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for one hour before being able to drive 44 miles(source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla‚Äôs, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive.   &amp;#x200B;  With the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.  **TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.  11@39.29  **TL;DR for TL;DR**: üìàüìàüìàüìàüí∞üí∞üöÄüöÄüöÄ|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9465339|public|confidence|self|||Why $NIO is a good buy|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0t3vy/why_nio_is_a_good_buy/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'cklgf8rtUtyYzhINYrzDYuwWkzCOfJtLUOexkqKFGXw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oVdEV6cBojIw7Z0nka7tE8m0uHK7MLROPk7Iqlyx8hA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600bfc61d4fb63336fec4709212d1bde19d4268b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oVdEV6cBojIw7Z0nka7tE8m0uHK7MLROPk7Iqlyx8hA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=148e1dc8ad938e6c797dba5bbbebebc9fa4a610e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oVdEV6cBojIw7Z0nka7tE8m0uHK7MLROPk7Iqlyx8hA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f46ac6da9c275f53baef62fcb622d6adc15f76aa', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oVdEV6cBojIw7Z0nka7tE8m0uHK7MLROPk7Iqlyx8hA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0803519f5f81465b57fc4738a793376ef1cedab', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oVdEV6cBojIw7Z0nka7tE8m0uHK7MLROPk7Iqlyx8hA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e8c6cb5cd78a1a3780644d4801dca0c2bec9ce6', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 512, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/oVdEV6cBojIw7Z0nka7tE8m0uHK7MLROPk7Iqlyx8hA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c0f64378df431469d8ef1ac72afd5d5bd2626979', 'width': 1024}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-03-08|GM

Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future  2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.  Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).  THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto  u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX  QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.  Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.  Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?  SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.  You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations.

Yes, you heard that right.   1.	GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles.   2.	GM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.  3.	GM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.  4.	GM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.  5.	GM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge!   6.	Apple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.  7.	Famous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.  8.	President Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.  9.	Chip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.  10.	Newly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).

 Here to talk about a company with alot of potential that isn‚Äôt GME or RKT. I know, I know, sad and im retarded and should just buy those stocks  Lordstown motors is IMO a heavily overlooked and undervalued EV stock that has not had its fair chance to flourish yet.   -They will be the first electric pickup truck to market -They have a 600 acre factory right here in the USA - A partnership with Camping world ( I know lame but distribution= üöÄ ) -100k preorders -45k price tag on the pickup after government incentives (52k without) -Backing by GM   All with only a 3.4B market cap.  If only half of the none binding preorders got filled(which is unlikely because the average order size is 600 and you need to set up charging stations for all those trucks at there destinations and that takes time and planning) that would be 2.6B in revenue. Almost the market cap currently. The orders will keep coming and the technology will be proven.    Analyst are attacking this stock for reasons I havent figured out yet. Morgan Stanley downgraded there price target due to not believing in Hub motor technology. How often do you think a guy at morgan stanley works on cars!? One of his concerns was running coolant lines to the wheels.... You know like where your brake lines go, and your wheel speed sensor harness, and vacuum lines... this guy had never even changed a flat tire.  They are also now reprinting old articles of a very early ‚Äúskateboard‚Äù(thats what lordestown calls the underlying design) on fire. Shit happens, the car was so early at that point it didnt even have the pickup body it comes with at that time. Also thats why they do these test. Go on there twitter and watch the test they put the hub motors through and the rest of the truck.  Another fear is ford, does anyone even know any other type of ford besides an F-150? So ford is gonna make and electric truck to compete against the only thing keeping them in business?! Im not saying ford wont have a nice electric truck but I do think they arent a good long play.  Steve Burns the CEO has entered the Lordstown Endurance into a 290 mile Baja race in Mexico to prove the concept.   The race is in April, Earnings are next week, the moon this year.   This isnt investment advice, I am clearly retarded and I wrote this all while I was licking the windows on the short bus     üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9424818|public|confidence|self|||My Wifes boyfriend loves to #RIDE|3.0|[]|0.71|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwk1ap/my_wifes_boyfriend_loves_to_ride/|some_ads|7||||dark||||||||||2021-03-03|GM

(Flavour of tendie sauce)  We   are in a market shortage for semiconductors and the material to make   them.The shortage is so bad it is a detriment to production of many   other sectors and companies.  It's so bad it hits [boomers hard and us even harder.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)  [Ford](https://www.motortrend.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-automotive-ford-f-150/) and [GM](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/gm-extending-plant-shutdowns-at-three-plants-due-to-chip-shortage.html) are having trouble keeping up.  GPU    and CPU shortages, shortages in the industrial sectors, and most    importantly shortage of tendies. That's right if you need tendies, you    need to get semiconductors. Demand for semiconductors is high and  supply   is low, so what does that mean? Free trip to the moon with  tendies and  extra sauce.  &amp;#x200B;  # The Good Stuff  $ON    Semiconductors, manufacture and sell semiconductor components for    various electronic devices worldwide. Their semiconductors are used in    automotive, industrial computers, robots, and appliances.  ""Other    manufacturing companies are getting left behind in the semiconductor    shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars,  whether   they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions  for  every  manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That  means  assembly   line robots, it means motor controls for CNC machines  and  shop   equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and   microwave. It  even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending   it all after  you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the   toaster, which uses a   power switch, which are made by $ON.

I'm    a grower and not a show-er, so if you want growth you can actually   hear  it from me personally. This company is a killer for revenue   because  they are financially stable and very profitable as is this   play.  ""The    one thing that sets   $ON apart from the rest of the equities on  this    list is that  they're  not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not  a    company that  simply  outsources chip production to other people     (overseas) and  who has  shown a willingness to keep some production in     house.   Matter of  fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that  he     wants to  maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.   Which     means  when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer  money   to    build out US production, they'll have their hands out.""  &amp;#x200B;  # USA's BBC (BIG BIDENS COMMAND)  Biden signed an [executive order](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-to-sign-executive-order-tied-to-semiconductor-shortage-11614177715)last week for ‚Äúan immediate 100-day review across federal agencies to    address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products.

Foxconn, the manufacturer of the iPhone, holder of trillions of dollars in assets, will produce the second vehicle designed. This will follow Magna‚Äôs production of the Fisker Ocean. Magna is a well established manufacturer that has contracts with many major automakers, including GM, BMW and Mercedes. Fisker inc is not trying to roll the dice and take on manufacturing on their own. This is massive for the credibility of Fisker inc. They are letting successful companies handle manufacturing so they can focus on what they do best, design. A lot of startups will try to take on everything at once and fail. I believe for a company that has yet to begin production , this is relatively low risk play. Not to say their isn‚Äôt risk, it‚Äôs just less than some of it‚Äôs peers... who are focused on becoming knockoff Tesla and are trying to do everything from scratch in China. Henrik Fisker however is very experienced in this industry, the designer of the BMW Z8, a few Aston Martins and many more.

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan.

The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.  The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.  Difference: Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft.   Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.  Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.  This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:  - Autonomous driving technology. - Connected car tech &amp; fleet management. - Electric vehicle technology. - Automotive retail. - Mobility-as-a-service &amp; shared mobility.  Who wins? In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

So if you do not want that please skip this post and go back to focus on GME. Otherwise keep on reading. Please note, this is an old throwaway account of mine because I do not want any relation to be made between my person and this DD.  So this DD is about the German supplier company Schaeffler (SHA015). Be aware of some currency switching between ‚Ç¨ and $ as well as a wall of text  **Key facts about the company**  * This is their website: [https://www.schaeffler.com/content.schaeffler.com/en/index.jsp](https://www.schaeffler.com/content.schaeffler.com/en/index.jsp) * They employ roughly 83,000 employees worldwide * Generated 14.4 billion ‚Ç¨ in sales in 2019 (\~17.5 billion $) * Net revenue of 428 million ‚Ç¨ in 2019 (\~520 million $), 881 million ‚Ç¨ in 2018 which decreased because of the car-crisis pre-corona * Growth in sales and in revenue outperformed all supplier competitors AND automotive manufacturers in the past years * As of today they have 4.5 billion market cap, 166 million shares publicly traded * For 2020 figures see below  **What is the business model?**  Schaeffler is one of the biggest automotive and industrial suppliers worldwide. It is a German company with solid financials (read more below). Their focus relies on high quality and precision components and systems in the Automotive and Industrial sphere. Now, what does this mean? Is Automotive not Industrial? Let me explain that. Schaeffler has three divisions: Automotive, which is supplying almost all automotive manufacturers in the world (even Tesla). Industrial, which is supplying stuff for machine tools, industry 4.0 and IoT solutions (of mechanical form) and renewable energy generation (they are inside almost every windmill in the world afaik). Automotive Aftermarket, which is essentially the division that is supplying all the car workshops with spare parts for cars. You can see they are setup in a broad way. I have more information on the individual divisions down below. Now, those divisions rely on the same knowledge and manufacturing lines (more or less) which generates lots of synergies in the company and creates additional value instead of just catering to all industries at all costs.  **About the family (shareholders) and the stock**  Schaeffler is more or less a family company which is listed at all major stock exchanges. A couple of years ago they had their IPO with a listing of 12,50‚Ç¨ (\~15,18$). I think that was in 2015. They then rocketed pretty quickly to 16/17‚Ç¨. Currently only 25% (166 million shares) of its shares are free float and publicly traded. Their traded shares also have no voting rights but have a nice dividend to them (30-40% of the net revenue). The other 75% of shares have a voting right but are all owned by the family Schaeffler (by a Holding company).  The family Schaeffler (the Holding company) also owns 46% of Continental. Another supplier company that is almost triple the size of Schaeffler and currently has a market cap of 24 billion ‚Ç¨. There is quite a lot as to why this is the case but in my opinion that is not really as important for this DD. Long story short, in 2008 Schaeffler tried to buy and swallow Continental, then the financial crisis hit and they had to take on lots of debt.  **Automotive Technologies division**  With Automotive Schaeffler is generating the largest part of its turnover and revenue. I do not have to add that this is also hurting them right now because it is obvious. However, when Auto is back to business, Schaeffler always outpaced its competitors and even the OEMs with its growth and revenue share. Schaeffler has parts in almost every car in the world.  In the Automotive division Schaeffler is manufacturing and developing all sorts of stuff for vehicles. This obviously includes combustion technology - boring. Exciting is what new stuff they have on the shelves. First of all that is a technology for 100% autonomous cars and they are currently the only company that has the permit to use this technology on the road in a lot of countries already right now. Google ""Space Drive"". Next is technology for electric cars. They acquired a smaller company that is known for its extremely efficient electric motors - their wiring technology and know how is superior. It seems like every other month Schaeffler is acquiring new orders for its electric motors whether it be in pure electric cars, hybrid cars or heavy duty vehicles. They are also on the forefront of developments for the usage of hydrogen in cars and other applications (also Industrial).  Besides the obvious business with European OEMs they are in quite large business with US and Chinese OEMs. Chinese business growing the fastest according to their recent releases.  **Industrial division**  The Industrial division is where they are manufacturing stuff for typical industrial applications. Like bearings for wind mills (they are inside almost every wind mill worldwide afaik) or machine tool stations. Here they are also working on developing ""smart"" bearings that know when their life span has ended. This is crucial in large scale manufacturing lines where a bearing failure can result in multiple million $ of damages. Schaeffler's solution for that is essentially marketed under the brand ""Optime condition monitoring"". Obviously incorporating all sorts of Industry 4.0 applications as well as Internet of Things. By the way, Schaeffler is also active in aerospace where they are actively helping to reduce the CO2 emssions of planes,  I could see them maybe work with drones in the future and rumor has it they even work on adapting the e-mobility motor technology for the aerospace industry. They are also inside many space applications such as space rockets and the rovers.  **Automotive Aftermarket division**  Aftermarket is where Schaeffler is selling stuff and spare parts and repair kits to automotive workshops to fix cars essentially. Honestly, I have no idea about the division and they make up for the smallest part fo the turnover/revenue. What is cool here is that afaik they can sell their stuff to all workshops and it can then be put into cars (where applicable) that were not even equipped with Schaeffler parts originally. Which would mean that is quite a huge market. The margins also seem to be quite good.  **Current financial numbers and cost-efficiency measures**  Now that we all have a very rough understanding of what Schaeffler is about and what they are doing, let us talk a little bit about risks, current financial numbers and what Schaeffler is doing to increase their flexibility and financial basis.  Initially Schaeffler lowered their expected results for 2020, in January they then published an AdHoc release saying that they unexpectedly outperformed their planning and can close the past year better than expected. See here: [https://www.schaeffler.com/content.schaeffler.com/en/investor\_relations/events\_publications/adhoc\_releases/adhoc\_releases\_detail.jsp?newsID=2059430](https://www.schaeffler.com/content.schaeffler.com/en/investor_relations/events_publications/adhoc_releases/adhoc_releases_detail.jsp?newsID=2059430) From my point of view they will end up with 10% less turnover compared to 2019 which would be \~13 billion ‚Ç¨ (\~15.7 billion ‚Ç¨) and a margin of 6.4% which is incredibly good for the current times if you are asking me. Might be that I read the release wrong lol...  How did they achieve those results? Let us talk about cost-efficiency measures they have initiated even BEFORE the automotive ""crisis"" started long before Corona. Obviously, I am not too fond here and we can only learn about this from their own publications. They are laying off people, closing plants that are no longer as profitable as before, they are moving manufacturing to lower cost countries and they are digitalizing and optimizing all their processes. According to Schaeffler their initiatives are working and their preliminary figures underlign this.  Risks: Well obviously, if the car market or industry market keeps crashing and does not recover, then this will plummet again. The floor around 6.60‚Ç¨ held quite good though and we had a run up to 7‚Ç¨ the last days. The thing is, this company is heavily investing in new technologies now and tries to reinvent itself. They recently announced an investment in a new central laboratory for R&amp;D. If e-mobility doesn't get big, well then Schaeffler is excellent in combustion tech. If  e-mobility kicks in (which is what we all expect, aren't we?) then Schaeffler has all the right equipment, knowledge and tools at hand. They even already get lots of orders for emobility stuff - check their press releases from the past months. In my opinion this is pretty fail-safe.  Another risk is that Schaeffler got approval to issue new shares in the coming 5 years if the need arises. Approval was given in the last shareholders' meeting in 2020 - obviously the only one allowed to vote is the family shareholder. So this is an obvious risk in the next 5 years.  **Stock price compared to other supplier and automotive stocks**  So, yes as written beforehand the company is getting some flack for the boring combustion engine technology, for having lots of employees and so on. But how does their performance compare to other companies? We can compare that with Continental, Timken (a much smaller US supplier) and some Automotive OEMs like VW, GM and the like. Comparing their stock's charts reveals something super interesting: All of the above (pretty much all car manufacturers as well as suppliers) started plummeting in 2019 because of a lack of car sales and then started a slow recovery until Covid hit in March 2020. Today, most Automotive OEMs are almost back to 2019 levels. Talking about suppliers the situation is a little worse but almost all of them are dealing with their stock being traded 10-20% below pre-Covid levels. However, Schaeffler is at a much higher discount. Now, if you factor in the performance of Schaeffler in 2020 and the preliminary figures from above paragraph you notice that a more or less fair value of the stock would be something around 9‚Ç¨ while it is sitting at 7‚Ç¨ at this very moment. So from my point of view there already is an upside of \~28% in the short term once people realize this is trading at a discount. Not even factoring in what they are doing in terms of future growth with emobility and Industry 4.0 stuff in the mid term.  **What else is going on?**  From here on this is more speculation than DD but nevertheless I wanted to mention it. So last but not least there is something interesting going on lately. Besides the typical insider buying of shares (which happens on a regular basis from almost all Executives, especially the CEO), the family shareholder Mr.Schaeffler recently gave ALL of his shares in Schaeffler (so 75% of the company) as well as all COntinental shares (so 46% of Conti) in pawn (I don't know the exact English wording for that) for a bank credit line. Essentially the shares serve as a security for the credit line. Now, how much is that in terms of money? More than 8.2 billion ‚Ç¨ (almost 10 billion $) at the time this took place at the beginning of February. So 10 billion $ in securities plus his other securities (privately owned stuff) would result in a credit that is atleast 10 billion $ from my point of view. Now, why would you need that if you still have a positive cashflow even during Corona and an Auto crisis? This is indeed a very good question.  So to answer this question I first had to research why anyone would have to put that many securities in the bank for a credit line and why would anyone use shares as a security. The result is, in 9 out of 10 cases this is typical behaviour for a loan that will be used to purchase and swallow another company. I then researched which other companies/competitors could be relevant and are in the ballpark of 8-12 billion $. Honestly, I couldn't find any. But then I remembered that Continental will bring its entire drivetrain division (conventional combustion engine tech PLUS all the e-mobility stuff and electronics and mechatronics) to the stock market with a spin off. And coincidentally this part of Continental is worth something around 8-10 billion ‚Ç¨ (9.5-12 billion $) according to Wikipedia. You can google ""Continental Vitesco spin off"". However, Schaeffler already owns 46% of Continental and as such also 46% of the supposed spin off company. Nevertheless this was the most reasonable thing they could do with such a huge loan in my opinion. The Schaeffler CEO always refuses this option and typically answers questions in that regard with ""agility is more important than pure size"". In his latest interview with a German financial newspaper (couple days ago) he said this again and also said they are more looking into acquiring something in the Industrial sphere and not Automotive, also they would favor smaller acquisitions rather than bigger ones. So take all that with a grain of salt.  **Target price**  Nope, you are not going to get this from me as I am not educated enough for it. On March 4 they are going to release the 2020 full year results, as discussed in the earlier paragraph the numbers are basically already published and are above expectations. Depending on the capital increase with new shares and/or the purchasing of another company I can not predict any prices for this stock. However I am on there with 600 shares at 12‚Ç¨ - yes, pretty sad I know lol but looking to average down. Personally I expect a potential increase in the share's price of 30-60% in the mid-term range.  **TL:DR**  **Schaeffler is a solid German supplier with solid financials and a good business model. Compared to its results it is highly undervalued especially considering its current measures for cost efficiency as well as lots of orders for electric mobility projects from major automotive manufacturers in the billions for the next years. Fuck me because I jumped in around 12‚Ç¨/share but it is a long term hold for me.**  &amp;#x200B;  No financial advice.

The president/the current administration has vowed to replace The Entire U.S. Government Fleet Of Vehicles, all 650,000 of them, with Electric Vehicles:  ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Monday vowed to replace  the U.S. government‚Äôs fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric  models as the new administration shifts its focus toward clean-energy.""

So, the Biden administration wants to Make America Great Again, and bring us back to the good ol' days before segregation, where ice cream cones were a nickel, and muscle cars were an icon of the era. Cool. Edit: Segregation is \_not\_ cool. But muscle cars are. Kinda. I mean, I'd drive a 2006 CTS-V if I could afford one. Anyway, cool.  I can think of two particular American auto manufacturers which were popular at the time:  Ford, and  GM  Yes there is Tesla, but Biden is a boomer, or maybe even older. And I forget what comes after two anyway, so Ford, GM, and whatever comes after.  And what's more, is Ford and GM are already cozy with the U.S. government, meaning that both have already received either large government contracts or/and bailouts.  And President Biden is a bona fide G-Man, and good ol' boys tend to do business together.  Case in point, I did not know this until writing this DD, but oh look, Oshkosh Truck has the USPS contract to build all the new Electric Vehicles, and who is sourcing them materials? fucking Ford.:  ""When asked if the ""sub-systems"" are engines and  might Ford have a piece of the contract as an engine supplier, Quigley  said, ‚ÄúThe vehicle will be built from the ground up by Oshkosh to  fulfill the unique needs of the postal service.

Not because you want to drive your Tesla from San Francisco to The Midwest where rent is still affordable, dummy. EV charging stations are important because the Biden administration is ALSO printing a fat fucking 1.7T stimmy contract for EV charging stations too!

Because Ford and GM have UNIONS. And Boomers fucking Love Unions, and according to the administration's Clean Energy Plan, any company which has a union, or will form one, seems likely to receive Uncle Sam's 'rich uncle' money:  * **Auto Industry:¬†Create 1 million new jobs in the American¬†auto¬†industry**, domestic auto supply chains, and auto  infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging  stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the  21st century; **and invest in U.S.¬†auto¬†workers to ensure their jobs are  good jobs with a choice to join a union.** * **Transit:**¬†Provide every American city with 100,000 or more  residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options through flexible **federal investments** ...  Yes, it's the lowest bidder which gets contracts, but, they Have to be American through-and-through, and, probably have to be a Union shop, which certainly narrows down the choices of companies even eligible to bid.  So, let's take this from the top:  Government owns the money printers.  Government gives out stimmy in the form of government contracts.  Biden is replacing all government fleet vehicles with EVs; about 650,000:  [https://www.government-fleet.com/301786/federal-vs-state-local-fleets](https://www.government-fleet.com/301786/federal-vs-state-local-fleets)  Biden is a Boomer.  Boomers love their Ford and GM brands.  Biden is a G-man.  Ford and GM have already gotten the G. And like a horny ex, Big Government prooobably wants to give them The Big G again -- possibly at the same time, e.g. multiple/simultaneous contracts, (giggity), because EVs, EV infra, and unions are sexy.  Also, Ford is \_already\_ a supplier to the USPS EV stimmy contract.  And now, the government needs to charge all these fucking granola EVs, but there's not enough infra.  Well, there's stimmy for charging stations in this admin too:  ""The Biden Admin is also printing stimmy contracts for EV \_chargers\_, 500,000, by 2030.""  And, GM has a kinky new partner who has been working out, EVgo, which has already built out EV-charging infrastructure, and is also going public Q2, 2021. And, I don't want to speculate, but if EVgo unionized, President Biden would have to worry about more than just ice cream stains on his suit pants... and EVgo would have to worry about what to do with all of rich Uncle Biden/Uncle Sam's money. -- What I mean is, GM might also be able to be a part of the EV charging contract, like Ford is a part of the USPS EV contract, or maybe GM gets an infra contract, and is EVgo's sugar daddy.  Again, I've noticed a pattern: the government has a ton of fucking money - they even print the money - shit they even own the money printers, follow the money, anticipate the money, stonks only go up, and if you choose the right stock, stonks go Way up, like private utility bills during a disaster in Texas, or Ford and GM when a Boomer president funds an EV renaissance.

So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!  **So Let's start!**  Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!  I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&amp;D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**  # FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)  Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.  As The Verge's Sean O‚ÄôKane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**  For more on Mach E comparison to Tesla cars: [Link 1](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/23322283-rd-barris/5534036-reviews-of-ford-mustang-mach-e-show-tesla-no-secret-sauce) Link 2  # What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?  **Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**  Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.  Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.  Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it‚Äôs averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won‚Äôt be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it‚Äôs off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).  Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven‚Äôt had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a¬†mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV‚Äôs first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.  **What about international production and sales?**  Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)  **What about Asia?**  Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)  **What about government support in production?**  Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker‚Äôs plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)  **Innovation and Technology:**  Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford‚Äôs transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford‚Äôs transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.  **What other EV models are they working on?**  in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.  # Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)  Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.  $Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple  (Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)  TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X  NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)  GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X  F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X  **(Important part starts here)**  As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.  If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.  If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö**.  Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**ü¶Ö** after a forest fire.  **TLDR:**  1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **‚úÖ** **üá∫üá∏**  2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **‚úÖ**  3- Have the government support. **‚úÖ**  4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **‚úÖ**  5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **‚úÖ**  **MY Price Target: 110$ TICKER:$F**  Position: 500 calls 17$ expires at 21 JAN 2022 (TICKER:$F)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9322984|public|confidence|self|||EV Play: Buying leap calls on America for the next big 2021 play PT.1|15.0|[]|0.9|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsh9fh/ev_play_buying_leap_calls_on_america_for_the_next/|some_ads|7|||||1614290626.0|2.0||||||||2021-02-25|GM

taking off. BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I‚Äôve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife‚Äôs boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.  Listen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.  Last few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol‚Äô titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that‚Äôs just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.  BB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it‚Äôs working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China‚Äôs google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV‚Äôs and use BB‚Äôs QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they‚Äôll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry‚Äôs QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that‚Äôs just the beginning. No we won‚Äôt see profit this March because it is yet to boom.   another product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it‚Äôs only one of their products. It‚Äôs a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.  IVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It‚Äôs basically an App store installed in AV‚Äôs, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don‚Äôt fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.  This is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.  DISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that‚Äôs why I yolo‚Äôd 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.  Also, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what‚Äôs on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.  Positions: 500 @ 12  Edit: Thanks a lot for the rewards retards, but shouldn‚Äôt you just buy more BB?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9313304|public|confidence|self|||$BB‚Äôs Time Has Come|13.0|[]|0.9|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrznso/bbs_time_has_come/|some_ads|7|||||1614247486.0|1.0||||||||2021-02-25|GM

When  I used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007, 8, 9, it  was well known that most people trying to start studios fail MISERABLY.  There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They'd have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn't want to make their living recording cool  music all day?  I was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I'll never forget.  They told me, ""you don't make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \*selling the dream of opening a  studio.""\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people's home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.  Let's  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There's going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house &amp; senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that's too much for my small brain. To try and \*time\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it's a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don't have the  brain for it.  One thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn't  \*matter\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn't \*matter\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.  We  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered ""not essential"" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.  I am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I'm more sharing this to  get criticism &amp; ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.  **TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**  Reasons:  **1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**  **2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**  **3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government &amp; pushing up the demand &amp; price for copper.**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9308398|public|confidence|self|||Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?|0.0|[]|0.58|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrsylv/thoughts_on_copper_as_an_inflation_infrastructure/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-02-25|GM

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term üöÄüöÄ, long term = big ‚¨áÔ∏è. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all.   Before I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards  Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.  First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&amp;D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.  Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second.  Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later. Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above).  Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'. Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong. Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more.   Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a üåàüêª so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood √§hem √§hem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.  There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish.  For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain.  However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.  So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&amp;D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today.   In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history.   So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a üåàüêª I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.  Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday  Feel free to call me a üåàüêª in the comments ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíã"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9305640|public|confidence|self|||A üåàüêª perspective on $TSLA|1.0|[]|0.73|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrne4v/a_perspective_on_tsla/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'EWZ2EPsx77As-HGvQJ-rvmyE5NTGHRCK9iI6UOvIaig', 'resolutions': [{'height': 76, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a126e210746d7127ec31145b9a5bc241cae0a8af', 'width': 108}, {'height': 152, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=908e2ee5c39b69db1307bd2f032438b019a854fd', 'width': 216}, {'height': 225, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c439b6ba60b3c5e46148cbcb56595cd6c97fd2b', 'width': 320}, {'height': 451, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f67e8c8b3932f3f54dd88e8248ff15c60eaafd62', 'width': 640}, {'height': 676, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f83c340b853dc854a22a03b00b9263933e78bc5', 'width': 960}, {'height': 761, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f11e1327d9076f52eb2dc36f972835e0ea127947', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/I6symoWINur363kyEQu2avGeIYiiKuRHXW_IBuUN0s4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=582a592c1a84bb1d370d57638235e88f96eefeef', 'width': 3290}, 'variants': {}}]}|||1614206139.0|||||||||2021-02-24|GM

I'll be offering one piece of DD on a stock every day for the next few days. On today's episode, GM.  tl;dr at the bottom  Why it'll ¬†üöÄthis year and next year:  1) Biden wants to make the entire US fleet EV by the end of his term. You really think he's going to buy $70,000 cybertrucks for the fleet? Can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy Teslas while the average American has to buy regular cars? I think Biden will be more likely to buy GM's newer electric cars once they come out because they'll be much cheaper. Biden also drives GMs cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there. I don't think it's a coincidence that GM announced going fully electric while Biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet. Either Biden knew GM was going electric or GM knew Biden would make this big purchase order.  2) Cap and trade? Have you heard of it? No? You should learn about it or else you'll lose out on tendies.  Cap and trade is complicated so I'm not gonna explain it here. Go google it. Point is, companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less CO2 compared to a gas car. In fact, Tesla would've **lost money** in 2020 if it wasn't for California's cap and trade program ([https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html)). Now that GM has access to this cap and trade market, they'll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies. This will also hurt Tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become.   Also, you know who's likely to pass cap and trade? The federal government. Obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Clean\_Energy\_and\_Security\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act)), but it was never brought to the senate. With climate change being a more pressing issue, and Biden's talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs, he's for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level. He's also publicly supported cap and trade ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/)). From his campaign website ""And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal, including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line."" This seems to refer to cap and trade as it's the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal. With democrats controlling everything, cap and trade is likely to pass this time.   Then again, politicians lie all the time and  Biden isn't much different. However, even if the feds don't step in, multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come.   3) GMs cars are comparable to Tesla's cars.  The Model 3 isn't actually that good. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles, about 22 miles longer than Tesla. Both cars cost about the same amount. The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging, so Tesla's starting to lose its moat here. Guess Elon's plan to not patent anything really screwed him over.  4) The PE on this is stupidly low. Come on? 12.13? It's practically **begging** to be bought at this price. Compare this to Tesla's 1,230. If GM and Tesla, both EV companies, had the same valuation, GM would be worth $5000. This is my price target lmao.  5) The UK, Norway, and other countries are planning to ban vehicles. Norway is the most aggressive at 2025. China is also considering it, which would make EV companies like GM go absolutely parabolic. GM has the Chevy Bolt, meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing EVs.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Why is the stock down?  There are a lot of things that make people scared of GM. Here's why I think they're dumb:  1) The chip shortage:  This is a concern for GM in the short run, but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019. Currently they're projecting the earnings will be $1-$2 billion lower next year due to the shortage. I think that's a worst case scenario and the market is **overreacting** to the chip shortage. The chip shortage is now getting the concern of Congress and Biden ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/)). Given that Biden always talks about manufacturing, funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win. He can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever. GM gets its chips from Qualcomm, which has a ton of facilities in the US and is based in San Diego. This can serve as an easy political win for Biden.   2) Charging stations. This isn't going to be a concern for much longer. Most people don't drive for long haul journeys, so driving stations aren't really needed. Think about it. If you could fill up your car with gas at home, would you ever go to a gas station? Very rarely. This is the point of EVs, and it's why I think they'll be the future. Also I hate to mention Biden again, but he's planning to put 500,000 public charging stations in the US by 2030. This won't be a problem much longer. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars))  3) bEaR mArKEt. Chill. This shit happens every couple of months. People panic and say the market is crashing. It's not. Even if it was, GM would hardly be hit because its PE is so stupidly low. IMO the only company that should tank a ton is Tesla. People always bring up the **bUfFeT inDicAtoR** because they think Buffet is some kind of god. He's not. Sometimes Buffet is an idiot. He doesn't understand the tech industry, and I think the rise in stocks recently is tech related. We're entering a new era of American capitalism where tech companies dominate. 7% stock market growth is the norm. With GDP rising 2% per year, you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run. The buffet indicator only measures GDP too, which isn't remotely the same as stock prices. Stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns. GDP doesn't factor wealth into consideration at all.   One last point: people think it's a buy and hold for 10 years, but it's not. I think GM will go to the moon ($5000) quicker than you think. Stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations. There are a lot of catalysts incoming (charging stations, no new gas cars, chip production, and cap and trade). If any one of these things are announced, that's GM to $100.   &amp;#x200B;  tl;dr Buy GM. Cap and trade, EV ban, and its undervalued price make it super attractive. GM will hit $5000. Buy or cry.

is not advice I have no idea what I'm talking about I went to a D-tier state school and got a C in accounting II. Please do your own research and don't come knocking at my door when you don't make gamestop money on Ford. Also this is my first DD after lurking for years so please be as mean as possible. Edited for formatting.   So we all know that EVs are the future and that someday we are all going to be driven around in Teslas, so you could dismiss the legacy automakers as boomer shit stuck in the past, but I think that the market has over-corrected for this and overlooked a couple things:  * Ford has been stealthily morphing into a tech-centric automaker * Ford's fundamentals are still really solid * Ford's new management team gets it  I'll go into detail into each below. Here are some ford financials from Yahoo finance to set up some context: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/key-statistics?p=F   * Forward P/E: 10.53 * P/S: 0.36 * Mkt Cap: $46B   **Factor 1: Ford understands where the auto market is going.** A couple years ago, when Ford announced that they were going to stop producing sedans for the US market, I thought they were smoking crack. Sedans still represent a thicc market segment. But nah, they kept around the high margin trucks and suvs and let GM, Honda, Toyota have the dwindling US sedan market so that they could focus their resources on developing next-gen products. And some of those are finally here and they are legit actually pretty good.   The Mach-E: $42k, 300mi range, 3.5 second 0-60. Fast charging. Not quite Tesla good yet but damn close. This is a legit viable product, and you don't get any of the Tesla customer service issues. If you factor in the $7500 federal tax credit, it's cheaper than a Model Y.   Electric F150 coming soon: best selling truck in America getting an EV version. It's going to be good too. The legit info on this car is coming later this year most likely and it's going to be solid. They've already demoed it pulling a million pounds (which is BS because it was on rails so doesn't count - so we don't get a real tow cap number yet but we know it's yoked). And it's going to look like a real truck so they can capture the whole toxic-masculinity-but-my-wife-cares-about-climate-change market.  They own part of Rivian. Rivian gonna be dope af and if they can leverage Ford's manufacturing experience they could potentially skip a large part of the painful production ramp-up that Tesla went through. And Ford gets paid in the process and gets access to the tech Rivian develops.   Tesla's PE is like fucking 200. That's how wall street values tech companies and innovation companies. Share price is gonna go ape once the analysts figure out that Ford is a tech company that is merely funded by a legacy automaker dinosaur.  **Factor 2: Ford's leadership gets it** Meet Jim Farley. He's like Jim Hackett, but palatable to the shareholders. What does he care about? Yeah, autonomous tech and EVs. Would you prefer he be focusing Ford's attention elsewhere? Didn't think so. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/new-ford-ceo-jim-farley-announces-restructuring-and-executive-shakeup.html   **Bear Case: Ford's Fundamentals Alone Under-Price it: They Make Cars People Actually Want** Lord Elon told God-Conduit Cathie Wood on her podcast (it's on Youtube but I can't link it - search for Elon Cathie Wood Podcast and it's at 3:30) that EVs sales will comprise 1/3 of global auto sales by 2023-2025. That's crazy growth given that EVs were about 2% of US sales last year (I know, not fair to compare US to world but it's not the main point, just context).   If that growth rate holds we're looking at like 8-10 more years of ICE vehicle sales. Which ICE vehicles do Americans like? That's right, fucking TRUCKS and SUVs, the exact vehicles that are Ford's bread and butter. The F-150 is the best selling vehicle in America and has been for years.   This vehicle segment is super margin - the average sale price of an F150 is over $40k according to CarGurus (https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/Ford-F-150-d337). People pay stupid money for these things and Ford will be happy to accommodate them.  So, let's assume that my thesis above is incorrect, and Ford has no future in the EV space and will do nothing milk the dying ICE Truck-Yeah market until the day they hit insolvency. How could we value them then?    Fortunately, such a car maker actually exists and it's called fucking Fiat-Chrysler. They Yolo'd everything into the Murica-Fuck-Yeah market segment and will literally sell you a Hellcat powered anything - only car they make that doesn't have a V8 option is the fucking Pacifica - a minivan. These guys are lunatics and pre-Peurgot merger had absolutely no plan for adapting to the future of the auto market except for buying gas mileage credits from Tesla. Let's compare their stats to Ford from above: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCAU.VI/key-statistics?p=FCAU.VI   * Forward P/E: 5.78 * P/S:  0.24 * Mkt cap: $42B  So the market is literally pricing Ford right now quite similarly to Fiat-Chrylser. Ask yourself who's future strategy makes more sense. If Ford fucked up literally everything going forward, I think their valuation makes sense. But if they have just a few product successes in the new automotive landscape, they are going to stick around... and there's your catalyst.

2009, I watched my 401k get cut in half due to the Great Recession. I didn't want to put a single dollar into the market, but I refused to take a dime out. I was scared. My wife, who is much smarter than me, convinced me to put $10,000 into stocks I thought might survive a decade. I did that, but I also chose one specific sector to favor more heavily than others. I chose infotech. It worked out.  This isn't the Great Recession. Indicators are pointing to a very healthy market ahead and a pretty big swing up--if the virus gets under control.  Today I woke up to find EV stocks on sale. It looks ugly, and there's plenty of reasons why this is happening right now. But the EV market isn't going anywhere; it's simply the future. And because of that, I'm sticking $60,000 into the market again tomorrow, but this time, I'm spreading it across a lot of stocks. Some more speculative than others. Everything will be pure calls or stocks purchases; no puts, no spreads.  Some of these stocks are going to collapse to pennies. Others will more than quadruple in value. I'm making this post so I can come back in ten years and kick myself for not choosing THAT ONE STOCK to invest the whole amount in, just like I did with Netflix. (Though I put most in it.) I also thought it would be good to get a bunch of EV tickers in the same place, so you can do your own DD and choose which of these might interest you. Or do like me, put larger amounts in the more stable picks, and throw some money on the craps table with some others.  You'll notice some popular stocks missing, because I just don't have any faith in them. Do your own research, and feel free to add more EV stocks below. Also, yes, some of these companies have (and will) merge, but I'm playing them here for different reasons.  TLDR: Buy when there's blood in the streets. EDIT: I'm up 36% on the day, lol, but these prices will fluctuate heavily, and some will fail and die.  **  * TSLA * GOEV * AAPL * NIO * BYDDY * THCB * NGA * VWAGY * GM * F * XPEV * LI * APTV * WKHS (WAIT) * FSR * CCIV * RIDE (above) * AYRO * DSGTs * FUV * NIU * LAND * CIIC * GIK *  * Associated with EVs‚Äî *  * RMO‚Äîbullish * QS‚ÄîBattery maker, solid state, risky * IDEX‚Äîwireless chargers for EVs * CAAS‚ÄîChinese auto parts * EXROF‚Äîcoil driver * CLII‚ÄîCharging station, largest in US * SBE‚ÄîCharging station * TPGY‚ÄîCharging station * BLNK‚ÄîCharging station *  * Lithium * ALB * LAC * SQM * AMVMF *  * Nickel * VALE * BHP * GLCNF|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9293613|public|confidence|self|||EV stocks are blood red.

What are the larger implications of this decision?  A lot of Marijuana, EV and Battery stocks have gone up assuming Biden will push for EVs and legalize marijuana  But what seems to be happening the leaders in the technology are not going to be supported with govt contracts. Instead the old economy companies are being given an on ramp to new technology using govt funds.  This was to be expected as the old economy companies have unions and Biden is a big Union guy.  So in the EV space rather than Teslas , Lucids, Fiskers the main beneficiaries will be F, GM and OSK.  In the Marijuana space instead of TLRY or APHA, the regulations will be written in suck a way that KO and Altria will be the ones who will be able to bring Marijuana to scale.

With the sudden and dramatic demand for semi-conductors for the past year, its complement silver has to be scarce as well thus driving up its price dramatically.   Sources:   1.

Roku, Deere &amp; Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news üöÄüöÄ**  Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.  7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy &amp; Financials hugely outperformed.  This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.  [Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications &amp; Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.  We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded. üöÄ  So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it‚Äôs very likely we won‚Äôt see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It‚Äôs really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.üöÄüöÄ  The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.  We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven‚Äôt seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.üöÄüöÄ  This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings &amp; many others reporting this upcoming week.  In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more &amp; more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng &amp; many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick &amp; chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again &amp; Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.üöÄüöÄüöÄ  On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn‚Äôt help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.üöÄüöÄüöÄ  [Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top &amp; bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.üöÄüöÄ  One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.üöÄüöÄüöÄ  But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

Roku, Deere &amp; Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news üöÄüöÄ**  Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.  7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy &amp; Financials hugely outperformed.  This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.  [Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications &amp; Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.  We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded. üöÄ  So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it‚Äôs very likely we won‚Äôt see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It‚Äôs really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.üöÄüöÄ  The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.  We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven‚Äôt seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.üöÄüöÄ  This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings &amp; many others reporting this upcoming week.  In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more &amp; more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng &amp; many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick &amp; chose.

Lordstown Motors is an electric vehicle company that specializes in pickups. Their flagship vehicle, the Lordstown Endurance has received over 100,000 pre orders (~580 per order) and will roll out in September of 2021. If everyone of these pre ordered cars were sold for 50 thousand dollars (the base price) they would already have 5B in revenue. I think they can get more than 150,000 pre orders before release in september, as they have full prototypes ready.   What makes the Endurance so special? What is different about the Lordstown Endurance is that it has an electric motor in each of the 4 wheels. The brakes recharge some battery and the vehicle can go up to 300 miles in one charge  Lordstown Motors has the right people in charge to make sure it will grow exponentially.  CEO - Steve Burns - 35+ years of experience,  Co founder and former CEO of workhorse, quit his position to found Lordstown Motors.  President - Rick Schmidt - 30+ years of experience at Tesla, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai &amp; Volkswagen  Chief Production Officer - Shane Brown - 28+ years of experience at Hyundai, Kia, Honda &amp; Volkswagen Chief engineering officer - Darren Post - 30+ years of experience at GM, karma, &amp; Delphi  VP of propulsion - John Vo - 25+ years of experience at Tesla, Honeywell, and others.  CFO - Julio Rodriguez - 30+ years of experience at Workhorse &amp; others.  I don't remember when the last time was that I saw such an experienced leadership team. Lordstown is gonna go places.  Market: ~65B fleet pickup US Market   *The pickup truck market is the most profitable segment of the auto industry  *Highly underserved market with no other competitors targeting the EV pickup space  *Large order volumes with sticky contracts across industries  *Significant Lordstown Endurance interest from government   Cost of Ownership All electric vs Internal combustion (over 5 years)  Lordstown Endurance: Initial cost: $52,500  Price per unit: $0.13 per KWh  Fuel cost: $5,200  Maintenance cost: $1,800  Fed. Tax credit: ($7,500) Total: $52,000   Ford Raptor 4x4 (internal combustion)  Initial cost: $51,775  Price per unit: $2.57 per gallon  Fuel cost: $14,280  Maintenance cost: $5,125  Fed. Tax credit: N/A  Total: $71,180   Difference: $19,180   Over a 5 year period, you will save $19,180 by buying an All Electric pickup. This is a huge bonus to big companies as they order 500+ of these cars, they will save more than 25% on each vehicle. This will save companies millions of dollars. (95.9M if they order 500 of Lordstown Endurance pickups over a traditional internal combustion pickup)    Production capacity: The 6.2M sq. ft production facility can produce an estimated 600,000+ Endurance Pickups yearly. This can be improved as they have $320M in cash to finance further growth. If they reach my prediction of 150,000 pre orders, this facility can produce them in under 4 months (~50,000 units per month) (this is theoretical I do not expect them to complete the pre orders any time soon)     Lordstown Motors has HUGE growth potential because of this, I expect it to reach $100 dollars by the end of 2021   If I could only buy one stock for 2021, this might be it.    Let me know your thoughts about Lordstown Motors|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9161868|public|confidence|self|||$RIDE EV pickup stock with already over 100,000 pre orders and roll out in September of 2021|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnucqs/ride_ev_pickup_stock_with_already_over_100000_pre/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-02-20|GM

About 80% of the parts are the same across an EV or traditional (aka non-hybrid) ICE vehicle. We know the big hedgies employ engineers or engineering research firms, so why shouldn't we get some of the same background. This is about the other 20% of parts.  Major EV specific parts:  Battery Cells - one of the more expensive parts, actually contain the energy. There's many different types. Large suppliers typically include Panasonic (PCRFY), LG Chem (KRX: 051910), and Samsung (SSDIY). OEMs are also getting more involved in this space through joint ventures / partnerships  Battery pack - basically just an electromechanical assembly of cells. Electromechanical = connect the battery cells, make sure the battery pack is safe, and get rid of heat generated by the cells.  Inverters - basically also motor controllers or variable frequency drives (VFD). All the power to the wheels goes through the inverters so a small increase in efficiency here can be very helpful to increase range. The main component in an inverter is transistors, which are basically a super high power switch controlled by a computer to turn on and off thousands of times a second. SiC (silicon carbide) transistors/inverters are the current standard, but GaN (gallium nitride) could further reduce size &amp; weight and increase efficiency. The ""best"" high power inverters typically use a vertical transistor, which due to engineering reasons is more easily adjusted for different power applications (basically vertical transistors get 3-dimensions of adjustability, while horizontal transistors get 2-dimensions). The GaN vertical transistors are a newer technology, and the early companies stand to make a bunch of money imo. These include GaN Systems &amp; Odyssey Semiconductor (ODII) and many others. Some of these are currently OTC, so you can't trade on Vlad's platform.  Motors/Drive Units - aka the spinny boiz. Lots of companies seem to be designing their own motors from what I found so no specific additional plays. They're being designed in house so that they can maximize efficiency based on how the companies think they'll be used.  Beyond these there are a ton of specific electronic parts that are needed but these are the major ones imo. Once again, do your own DD. I like the stock.

Tesla, on the other hand took the help from Chinese Investment on early 2019 went through the most difficult phase with minimum sales figure and tiny sales figure during the pandemic painlessly, seen booming value that created an illusion (everyone woule be buying that in the future). Not denials that  new energy is needed in terms of economic transformation. but how much market really is supporting it. remember only those who are in the U.S. need a car otherwise crippled. Also same bunch of ppl assume sales of e-cars is going to be as successful as iPhone in China. Totally false with other side of the the world occupied by traditional car makers and China not many traditional car makers but not facilitated fully resource enteralized city that doesn't need car at all. giving you a taxi market for all TSLA NIO XPENG to compete and lab, what else you got, Chinese consumers are buying but only to a limited group, who want a plate in Shanghai, Beijing where plate is lottery based before e-car (plate are given per e-car purchase) you guys must not seen the Jammed highway in these big cities, and who want a car with discount (over the time TSLA is dropping the price, it only adds future debt and reduced potential revenue model)  Thus they started invested encrypted hashes, which in the near future not deemed as a bubble..  In summary one bubble to the next, Your Daddy Musk is really good at bubble control.  This is not a financial advice, and investment is super risky as GME.. let me know your thoughts if think the same way and suggest me some good ticker alternatively. Semi-conductor manufacturers are great but too late to catch. not going to invest any bit in encrepted hashes too, my future income is betting those pls suggest with your DD.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9142822|public|confidence|self|||DD TSLA|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln2o9j/dd_tsla/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-02-19|GM

The fourth quarter of 2020 was a big        quarter for the S&amp;P 500, and investors were likely interested in what        top managers were buying and selling heading into 2021.       Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers in Q4, with        Tepper and Klarman selling and Soros buying.       Auto stocks have been hot in the market, and Cooperman was buying        General Motors on the strength while Soros was taking profits.       Buffett took huge new positions in Verizon and Chevron, both of which        pay dividend yields above 4.4%. Buffett also reduced exposure to bank        stocks in the quarter, selling Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, M&amp;T and PNC.       Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Tepper bet        on the Energy Sector by buying the XLE fund while Soros made a big bet        on emerging markets by buying the EEM fund.

The below is my opinion. Do your own due diligence.  TLDR: RIDE is a no brainer. Beta production is coming online and should be ready by march (57 vehicles). Over 100,000 preorders. Money from government. Crayons on charts point up. Boom.  **Who is RIDE**  Lordstown Motors Corp., an automotive company, develops, manufactures, and sells light duty electric trucks targeted for sale to fleet customers. It primarily develops Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. Lordstown Motors Corp. was founded in 2019 and is based in Lordstown, Ohio.  **Recent news to make you randy**  [Lordstown Motors Corp.

There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.  **Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**  Nikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.  But Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.  **Something about crayons.**  I found this chart on [Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RIDE/R36RkOqU-RIDE-RDY-TO-BOUNCE/). Do what you will with it.  `&lt;!-- TradingView Chart BEGIN --&gt;`  `&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""`[`https://s3.tradingview.com/tv.js`](https://s3.tradingview.com/tv.js)`""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`  `&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;`  `var tradingview_embed_options = {};`  `tradingview_embed_options.width = '790';`  `tradingview_embed_options.height = '475';`  `tradingview_embed_options.chart = 'R36RkOqU';`  `new TradingView.chart(tradingview_embed_options);`  `&lt;/script&gt;`  `&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""`[`https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RIDE/R36RkOqU-RIDE-RDY-TO-BOUNCE/`](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RIDE/R36RkOqU-RIDE-RDY-TO-BOUNCE/)`""&gt;$RIDE RDY TO BOUNCE &lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=""`[`https://www.tradingview.com/u/jeffreytesterman/`](https://www.tradingview.com/u/jeffreytesterman/)`""&gt;jeffreytesterman&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=""`[`https://www.tradingview.com/`](https://www.tradingview.com/)`""&gt;TradingView.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`  `&lt;!-- TradingView Chart END --&gt;`  &amp;#x200B;  I will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/17/2020) at $32.43 while RIDE is at $24.74. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.  **What makes them different**  Their biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).  **Anything else besides a truck?**  Two other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).  **What does your crystal ball tell you?**  Absolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.  **Catalysts**  March will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.  April - ??? The Department of Energy will decide on the loan. I[t helps when you have a huge cheerleader in office (Tim Ryan).](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/lordstown-motors-is-riding-on-hopes-with-biden-and-ryan/ar-BB1dmEBd)  Some time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.  September The beginning of live production.  **Price targets**  Using GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.  **Positions**  600 shares averaged at $22.40  (increased 300 shares since I first tried posting)  5 04/16/2021 $25 calls (I removed the short side because I'm dumb)  PS: Too many people complain ""I wish I knew before it popped! Wah!"" Well, here you go. Do your own due diligence, sack up, and get in if your balls didn't shrink from taking this decision."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9114710|public|confidence|self|||RIDE DD (Third attempt)|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm53nc/ride_dd_third_attempt/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '9_rIUPFVhBbDym2-tCooT7Z1Xhh2SAAwrguub2vD4fw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 52, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd731382ade0945e43ba1dfdb02a1f1fcfaf80d', 'width': 108}, {'height': 105, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efa53616beedc0237214afe9846735c017ffcb1f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 156, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff707136d03dd8835b89ed0d4a6747f62a73abbb', 'width': 320}, {'height': 313, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=832d6db9978e7ed430482807d31e4067338436ad', 'width': 640}, {'height': 470, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b9adf230c0c2652fa3869637cb07f9f195e3002', 'width': 960}, {'height': 529, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d870b7c1f3d43861df386a379d3e3effc903ba30', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 980, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pQfcdiwS4HUG-MMQ_ZoZP365hBu1blwbTiBr1OEWLFU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=92c3d87b78f49acc1d4d96815dfa76f4feb4dd84', 'width': 2000}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-02-17|GM

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts on Rocket, but no posts focused on their culture. A lot of posts explain ***what*** they're doing, but this one will explain ***how*** they're doing it.  In RKT DD Part One, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. *Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below:*  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In RKT DD part II, I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT.  The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket‚Äôs **company culture** ‚Äì which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015. Based on my experience, Rocket‚Äôs culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock-up expiration period on Feb. 2. Rocket employees, especially their executives, don‚Äôt view Rocket as just a company. They view Rocket almost as a religion, which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live.  In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article, the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results. The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT. After living Rocket‚Äôs culture and researching Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äì it is astonishing how similar both cultures are. *Article Link Below:*  [https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company](https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company)  Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do, but rather who they are. Amazon‚Äôs culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity. Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon‚Äôs diverse business together. Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder, Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies (15 of which are under $RKT).  &amp;#x200B;  # Introduction to RKT‚Äôs ‚ÄúISMs‚Äù and ‚ÄúISMs Day‚Äù  Rocket‚Äôs culture is based around 20 ‚ÄúISMs‚Äù (aka philosophies) which serve as guiding principles. I will admit that these principles are obvious, and many companies likely have similar ones. But companies‚Äô values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company‚Äôs day-to-day norms.  Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host **‚ÄúISMs day.‚Äù** ISMs day is a seminar dedicated to understanding the deeper meaning of the core values of Rocket. Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of $50B. They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles. I kid you not, if you make a mistake at work, some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti-ISM sins.  As a former United States Army captain, I can tell you that Rocket‚Äôs first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army‚Äôs 11-week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft. Benning, GA. Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers.  &amp;#x200B;  # ‚ÄúEvery Client, Every Time - No Exception, No Excuses‚Äù  Like AMZN, standards are very high at RKT, especially when it comes to customer service. If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer‚Äôs email or phone call on the same day, then they will receive a ‚Äúno return call complaint‚Äù (NRCC). No matter if you‚Äôve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days ‚Äì if you get three NRCCs, then you are automatically fired, on the spot, ‚Äú‚Ä¶no exceptions, no excuses.‚Äù  My most memorable moment of **‚Äúevery client every time no exception no excuses‚Äù** was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage. The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker (me). Three hours after he was routed to my phone, I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident ‚Äì he even CC‚Äôd Dan Gilbert. **That‚Äôs right boys and girls, I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself, getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT** (The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner).  The former CEO didn‚Äôt go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president, who would then go through my director and then to me ‚Äì he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles. *(Rocket HATES red-tape bureaucratic layers; it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy).* The RKT CEO even had a 5-minute call with my director as a follow up. CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket‚Äôs guiding principles: **‚Äúevery client, every time, no exceptions, no excuses.‚Äù**  #   # ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not About Who Is Right, But What Is Right‚Äù  All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company‚Äôs ISMs. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view. Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM, **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not who is right, but what is right.‚Äù** I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day, for a few weeks in a row. Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket **‚ÄúEvery Second Counts‚Äù (another ISM).**  During my first ISMs day, Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees. Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket‚Äôs culture.  *‚Äúif you guys ever get too busy to return a customer‚Äôs phone call ‚Äì let either of us know and we will call them for you,‚Äù* said Gilbert.  Of course, no one was stupid enough to do this, but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on **customer focus**.  I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this. It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company. Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious, so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates. If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks, they would decline and then show you the door. I am talking The Office, Michael Scott to Toby style exit.  &amp;#x200B;  # ‚ÄúIgnore the Noise‚Äù  ISMs exerted such a strong force on me, that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult ‚Äì but instead of listening to them, I would **‚ÄúIgnore the noise,‚Äù** which is an ISM that means, ignore the ‚Äúnaysayers‚Äù and never let them stop you from success. There will always be noise in our lives ‚Äì but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead.  I was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult. They didn‚Äôt understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life. Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled, so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built. The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit. We didn‚Äôt understand why people would bad-mouth a company who gave young, non-college educated kids the chance to make $20,000 a month in exchange for hard work. RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered, in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company (more on that later).  I also remember when **‚Äúignore the noise‚Äù** was used against me. I complained to a co-worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me, he looked at me with an almost robot-like stare and said, ‚Äú**ignore the noise,** man.‚Äù Rocket had programmed him; he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system.  &amp;#x200B;  # ‚ÄúWe Are The They‚Äù  Rocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves. Any negative remark against the company, was a negative remark against the individual employee, which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult. **‚ÄúWe are the they‚Äù** was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one. **‚ÄúWe are the they‚Äù** means that there is no ‚Äúthey.‚Äù The ‚Äúthey‚Äù is all of us. ‚Äú**We Are The They‚Äù**: One team. United. All in the mission together.  &amp;#x200B;  # Action oriented ISMs (i.e. ‚ÄúInnovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôll figure it out,‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery Second Counts‚Äù)  Rocket‚Äôs ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM. Don‚Äôt you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end, no decision was ever made? Rocket loves ideas. Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly (flat hierarchy) when you have an idea. But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above. At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every ‚Äút‚Äù and dot every ‚ÄúI‚Äù before launching a new innovative idea. If you did, progress would never be made ‚Äì they emphasized that employees **‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù** by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way. A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas.  It‚Äôs not just the customer-facing bankers that carry the ethos. Every. Single. Person. in the company, responds with a sense of urgency.  Now you ‚Äúnaysayers‚Äù might be asking how do I know if Rocket‚Äôs culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company. I left Rocket in 2015, and I am now a supplier for them. I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer-facing bank force. They respond to my emails the quickest, out of any of my 400 customers. It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company, not just their sales team.  What happens if you are not on the ball? Simple: you are fired. This company is on the **lunatic fringe** of perfection. The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands, which is outlined in one of Amazon‚Äôs 14 leadership principles ‚ÄúInsist on the Highest Standards.‚Äù  #   # Who Does Rocket Hire and why?  Rocket hires anyone and everyone. Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs. He doesn‚Äôt care if you have a college degree, high school degree or neither ‚Äì he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created. If not, they are fired at a moment‚Äôs notice.  His way of hiring non-college educated kids, who somewhat embody Detroit, is genius. The non-college educated, young 20-year old‚Äôs are given a second chance: a chance to make easily over 6-figures. Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them.  Non-college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones.  Why? Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does. Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies. They are the ambassadors of Dan‚Äôs ISMs.  &amp;#x200B;  # How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit?  These ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee, but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work. Whenever I got bad service, I would become irritated. Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable. I didn‚Äôt realize how truly special and impactful Rocket‚Äôs culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company. Its true: leaders either create a culture, or the culture will create itself.  Rocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency. In 2010, at the height of the recession, Detroit‚Äôs unemployment was 3x the national average. Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time. Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century. When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession, Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia, Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit.  I can‚Äôt explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit. Everyone laughed at Dan‚Äôs decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit ‚Äì but Dan followed two ISMs **‚ÄúYes before no‚Äù** and **‚Äúyou have to believe it to see it.‚Äù**  They doubted Dan‚Äôs ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s, just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app, with no loan officer, in 2015. The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league (do you notice a trend?)  The same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f\*\*ck the shorts who are driving down his stock.  They‚Äôre also now laughing at Dan‚Äôs vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world. But Dan follows **‚Äúyou have to believe it, to see it‚Äù** to the T. And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck.  Following the 2010 move, Detroit has become Rocket‚Äôs symbol ‚Äì it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself.  The character of the city ‚Äî its grit, resilience, and fortitude ‚Äî gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder. This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market‚Ä¶both locally and beyond; and it‚Äôs quite powerful.

Rocket is more than a company; it is a belief system that unites 20,000 employees to a common goal. This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively ‚Äì just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe.  Culture isn‚Äôt about what gets done, but how it gets done. Rocket‚Äôs belief system can apply to any industry, not just mortgages. That‚Äôs why Gilbert pounds into his employee‚Äôs heads:  *‚Äúit‚Äôs not what we do, it‚Äôs who we are that defines us.‚Äù*  It‚Äôs why Gilbert went public: he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options. He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today.  It‚Äôs why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit. Yes, there's a part of this that is about community and altruism, but it is also about business. It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it‚Äôs business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs. By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit (which he does), Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket‚Äôs multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process.  I see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company. But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket‚Äôs empire. Trust me, but as Dan Gilbert would say, you have to **‚Äúbelieve it, to see it.**  Gilbert's empire is just getting started.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  To view all of Rocket's 20 ISMs, please refer to the link below:  [https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies](https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9069580|public|confidence|self|||"RKT DD Part II: A former employee's take on Rocket's Culture and how it will allow them to become the ""Amazon of financial services."""|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'NunvEkAQhWvHckxvO6zdm29PaCyYDQTISUmcjZ6Whf0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 74, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dyp9_i97AihoAEQdzCdRq6DPfoHdPvpMOqUPoTVNHiw.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb8bedc21b42df0e5d2c1978e4fa116ca9385d0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 148, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dyp9_i97AihoAEQdzCdRq6DPfoHdPvpMOqUPoTVNHiw.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2608eaccdf96d0274d2110ceea1947e16ef046f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 219, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dyp9_i97AihoAEQdzCdRq6DPfoHdPvpMOqUPoTVNHiw.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e47279124a9ff04c69726c84fa526484ed48afc7', 'width': 320}, {'height': 438, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dyp9_i97AihoAEQdzCdRq6DPfoHdPvpMOqUPoTVNHiw.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be6b46a25024173b378fd5fc4f69458742937af', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 503, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dyp9_i97AihoAEQdzCdRq6DPfoHdPvpMOqUPoTVNHiw.png?auto=webp&amp;s=6179732d1cb8f92e5fb793dc80e050f7c7c42f69', 'width': 734}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-02-15|GM

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts on Rocket, but no posts focused on their culture. A lot of posts explain ***what*** they're doing, but this one will explain ***how*** they're doing it.  In RKT DD Part One, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. *Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below:*  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In RKT DD part II, I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT.  The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket‚Äôs **company culture** ‚Äì which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015. Based on my experience, Rocket‚Äôs culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock-up expiration period on Feb. 2. Rocket employees, especially their executives, don‚Äôt view Rocket as just a company. They view Rocket almost as a religion, which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live.  In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article, the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results. The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT. After living Rocket‚Äôs culture and researching Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äì it is astonishing how similar both cultures are. *Article Link Below:*  [https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company](https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company)  Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do, but rather who they are. Amazon‚Äôs culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity. Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon‚Äôs diverse business together. Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder, Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies (15 of which are under $RKT).  &amp;#x200B;  # Introduction to RKT‚Äôs ‚ÄúISMs‚Äù and ‚ÄúISMs Day‚Äù  Rocket‚Äôs culture is based around 20 ‚ÄúISMs‚Äù (aka philosophies) which serve as guiding principles. I will admit that these principles are obvious, and many companies likely have similar ones. But companies‚Äô values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company‚Äôs day-to-day norms.  Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host **‚ÄúISMs day.‚Äù** ISMs day is a seminar dedicated to understanding the deeper meaning of the core values of Rocket. Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of $50B. They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles. I kid you not, if you make a mistake at work, some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti-ISM sins.  As a former United States Army captain, I can tell you that Rocket‚Äôs first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army‚Äôs 11-week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft. Benning, GA. Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers.  &amp;#x200B;  # ‚ÄúEvery Client, Every Time - No Exception, No Excuses‚Äù  Like AMZN, standards are very high at RKT, especially when it comes to customer service. If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer‚Äôs email or phone call on the same day, then they will receive a ‚Äúno return call complaint‚Äù (NRCC). No matter if you‚Äôve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days ‚Äì if you get three NRCCs, then you are automatically fired, on the spot, ‚Äú‚Ä¶no exceptions, no excuses.‚Äù  My most memorable moment of **‚Äúevery client every time no exception no excuses‚Äù** was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage. The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker (me). Three hours after he was routed to my phone, I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident ‚Äì he even CC‚Äôd Dan Gilbert. **That‚Äôs right boys and girls, I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself, getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT** (The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner).  The former CEO didn‚Äôt go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president, who would then go through my director and then to me ‚Äì he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles. *(Rocket HATES red-tape bureaucratic layers; it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy).* The RKT CEO even had a 5-minute call with my director as a follow up. CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket‚Äôs guiding principles: **‚Äúevery client, every time, no exceptions, no excuses.‚Äù**  &amp;#x200B;  # ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not About Who Is Right, But What Is Right‚Äù  All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company‚Äôs ISMs. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view. Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM, **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not who is right, but what is right.‚Äù** I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day, for a few weeks in a row. Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket **‚ÄúEvery Second Counts‚Äù (another ISM).**  During my first ISMs day, Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees. Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket‚Äôs culture.  *‚Äúif you guys ever get too busy to return a customer‚Äôs phone call ‚Äì let either of us know and we will call them for you,‚Äù* said Gilbert.  Of course, no one was stupid enough to do this, but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on **customer focus**.  I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this. It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company. Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious, so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates. If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks, they would decline and then show you the door. I am talking The Office, Michael Scott to Toby style exit.  &amp;#x200B;  # ‚ÄúIgnore the Noise‚Äù  ISMs exerted such a strong force on me, that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult ‚Äì but instead of listening to them, I would **‚ÄúIgnore the noise,‚Äù** which is an ISM that means, ignore the ‚Äúnaysayers‚Äù and never let them stop you from success.

It is long but I hope you will enjoy it.     Read this all or you will die. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the    company Forum Merger 3 who is  merging with Electric Last Mile    Solutions, an EV company    specializing  in last mile delivery and work    vans. ELMS will be the first    and only  Class 1 electric vehicle on    the market, coming as early as   Q3,  with  no other Class 1 EV as    competition. They are also bringing a   Class  2  EV truck to market    next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to   be   first to market in    Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over  the   old  Hummer plant    in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of    working  with an    already successful EV company, allowing for instant     transposition  of   truck plans ready for production.  ELMS     has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has       received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current   stock     price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock   other than     some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical   behavior for   most   EV companies. So what  gives?  After      doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back   most investors back from committing to this great company is their        connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a        company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not        unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the        market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new  companies,       we want maximum transparency, which seems almost  impossible any   time     we're dealing with a Chinese company. However,  as my research   has   shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is  nothing to be   concerned   about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite ‚Äì  something that   will help   propel them   forward and accelerate their  process through   previously   successfully   developed truck plans and  numerous industry   connections.  # I.  The Team  First,       let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to     know,  a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team  behind     ELMS  is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry  with   years  of   experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into  each of   the  team   members, some  interesting connections emerged  amongst  them  and  amongst   different   auto/EV companies(including a   connection to  Tesla)  . These   connections  made some of the pieces   start to fall  into  place. In   particular, I  wanted to figure out   more so their  connection  to the   Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and   something to  be concerned  about?   After digging deeper  my  questions  were answered.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Allstars](https://preview.redd.it/2bs3me57pph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3d824dc0ec289199bfbf443b6a2f4f70f39199b)  ***The Allstars*** ***-***  **James (Jim) Taylor** ‚Äì 35+ years experience ‚Äì CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**        he pivoted the company‚Äôs focus from the electrification of cars   and      SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors,   now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working   with).      Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.        Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of     Cadillac,    which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is     the    powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a     company and    what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs.  He    probably has    some of the most experience of anyone in the  industry    when it comes  to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with  Henrik  Fisker  of FSR) and    Workhorse which we all know. His  innovation and    experience on developing    different types of EVs,  will allow for    future design and build    improvements. Jim, also  Canadian, is known as    ‚ÄúThe Great One‚Äù when it    comes to the EV  world. He is also known as    Jim ‚ÄúThe EV Man‚Äù Taylor,    because like  the show Home Improvement,  he   is always building and    innovating in  the garage.  **Jason Luo** ‚Äì 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.         Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems   (now      Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety     companies    in the world.  Oversaw the company‚Äôs acquisition of  Takata    Corporation    for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the  board  of   directors of    Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions,  ATCDrivetrain and    Sybridge  Technologies.    He has extensive  experience in the automotive    world and  more   importantly with large  companies. In addition he  has   been  through a few   different  mergers and acquisitions which is  an   added  benefit. He knows   what  it takes to come out on top.  **Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,        Inc .  She previously led Google‚Äôs automotive services program,      during   which time she released Google products, including Google   Maps,    into   automakers‚Äô new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has   served on    the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd   largest  auto   dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is  that  she is  the   co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**        (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation       industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I       found on  their group website was called ‚ÄúHigh-Potential Regions for       Electric  Truck Deployments‚Äù. It talked about geographical areas  they      want to  focus on and develop ‚Äì one of them being the Great  Lakes.   Guess    where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the  Great   Lakes.     This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events ,  so she   can use    this board as a  means to spread the word  throughout the   industry.    Interestingly enough,  this group just  started running an   EV truck demo    for data collection  and  analytics, and two of the   companies already    involved are  Lightning  E-motors and  Workhorse.  **Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,         during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard  also       helped expand the company‚Äôs international  footprint in many    European     and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS    get some     international connections. Hes overseen numerous    acquisitions, as well     as being a leading member of the team that    managed UPS‚Äôs IPO in 1999,   at   the time the largest in U.S. history.    He is no stranger to     understanding what it takes to make a new    operation a successful one.  **Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.        Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving       company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign       from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an       employee. You could  say she really turned his software into  hardware!      Brian currently serves  on the boards of aemsAG and  Footprint US      (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the  Boards of Deere      &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry  Association, as well as      serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone   Advisory Committee. He is the go      to guy for the chips and computers  for  the vehicles. This will  help     with any autonomous driving they  have  planned, as well as  their on     board ELMS-AIR system (more on  this later).  **Neil Goldberg**,       - 45+ yrs ‚Äì Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;       Flannigan Furniture and Holdings.

TTCF has done suprisingly well,   despite it being  one  company   that I  was not fond of due to my  nutrition  background. I   think the   food itself  is over priced crap  but it has held  steady  in  price ever   since merger  completion. This  bodes well for  ELMS.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Players](https://preview.redd.it/q8j7p4l8pph61.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17458efffdd343f8a5ad386b9c4411e49ef3022b)  ***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***  ***Jerry Hu***       ‚Äì 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership  and     Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and  other     management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**  ***Justin Prann*** ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.  ***Kev Adjemian*** **‚Äì** 20+ years ‚Äì CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**.

So      as we can, see  this team is ridiculously good and has excellent       connections that  run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and  other      places  around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies  that  are      connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS,  tell  me    that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings.  This team     covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top  contender   in   the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience,  have held   top   level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the  knowledge   and   know-how in  many  different aspects of electric  vehicles and the     industry overall.  # II. What Does ELMS Do?  Now       that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they      do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial       delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV      companies  include:  ‚ñ™First and      Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely  HUGE     for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity  of     being alone  in the field.  ‚ñ™Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production  ‚ñ™Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later  ‚ñ™Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1  ‚ñ™Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China  Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note ‚Äì this is from December so it may have changed some since.  &amp;#x200B;  [Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/rkcwj2napph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d0d49117764f39296c81d7c2c7a53928565fc5)  The       ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline       counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo    space   ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by     35% (50%    compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around     $1550 for   ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1.  It    becomes   even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume  per    cubic ft   that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have  218ft.   It  appears   that they  have plans to make different  variations of   their  Class 1  and  Class 3,  being able to turn them  into Class 2s as   well  based off   individual  needs. They will have a  range of 150 to   200 miles  and be   capable of a  full recharge in as  little as two   hours. These  types of   vans are used in  many  capacities of our   society. For example,  delivery   and ecommerce   (Amazon, Fedex, DHL),   communications (Verizon,    Comcast), small   businesses (local flower   shop, food trucks), and    utility and local   municipality vehicles.   There is no lack of demand for    these types  of  vehicles.  A    cool  feature  that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS   that  I   think has  been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the    vans    themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to  a      specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that    business.    This includes  things like installing custom drawers and    cabinets,    shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical    upfitting process    involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous    different ones, and    takes on avg 130-140  days from order to    delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :  ‚ñ™ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery  ‚ñ™ One warranty single point of contact for customer  ‚ñ™    Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently      in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and     Auto   Truck Group.  I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.  &amp;#x200B;  [Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/m4grfq9bpph61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f85a1b04e12db2c92c25425567d2052f4dae97)  Next,     the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS -AIR,     an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find   much      information about any specifics except for some clues in their      investor   presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data  systems     in   partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide  many     benefits  to  their customers. Some areas that will be  serviced include :  ‚ñ™Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles  ‚ñ™Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance  ‚ñ™Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports  ‚ñ™Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins  Some       of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla     for   example, are the ability for the software updates to happen       frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in       communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be       collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be.     The   experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from  Intel    will    be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing  with a    system   like this is more  and more areas of value for the  companies    buying it.   For example, there  will be savings from being  able to    easily collect   accurate tax data and  driving logs from  the drivers.    Time will also be   saved with something  such as the  automated  updates   and knowing exactly   when a van will need  to be  serviced or   inspected.  As time goes on and   more data becomes   collected, the   ELMS-AIR  service will only prove to  be  more valuable  for  both the   company and  their customers.  # III. Sales and Financials  The       ELMS team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in   connection     with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion  enterprise  value at     closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have  $379 million of  cash to     fund  operations and growth. They have said  that no additional   capital     requirements are needed after close to  achieve positive cash   flow.     With  their $379 million cash minus  $150mill in debt, that  gives  us    $229  million in net cash to work  with. There are a total  of     142,500,000  shares. Current market cap  at the share price of  $12, gives     us $1.71  billion.  ELMS      currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,   representing  a    revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to   60,000  orders by    the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they  are in   talks with or    have preorders from already,  include: Penske,  Cox +   Siemens (cant  make   that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS,  and others.   These  contracts   will work directly with  companies such  as Ikea,  Best  Buy,  Walmart,   Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience  and  connections of   the team will   no doubt lead to more  contracts  in the  future.  The  ELMS   business plan  includes a conservative volume ramp, with      approximately  4,000  vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth      quarter of 2021,   accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in      2022, and   approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. ‚ÄúOur team      collectively has   decades of experience launching vehicles for global      OEMs, and so  while  the facility has an annual production capacity  of     100,000  units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial   volumes    so  that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new   brand,     establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.‚Äù  I    have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000       preorders  being ‚Äúcontingent upon satisfaction of customer       requirements.‚Äù As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more       than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off  its      Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will  give   the    customers  everything they want and then some. If  anything, I   would    expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than  their Sokon   counterpart.  &amp;#x200B;  [Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.](https://preview.redd.it/6niamm8cpph61.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31829ca0dab1801b3b92033ced5fb13596095a9e)  **\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*  *THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.        Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was  the       mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very  mixed       results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an  emphasis  on      creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area.  Guess where  the  new     ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right  next to  South Bend  in    the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be  possible  that ELMS  will    have  first priority now for any new  government  contracts  relating to  EV   delivery or services, or maybe  additional   funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's  plan to   electrify the US, and now Mayor    Pete has a perfect  opportunity to   give back to his hometown and bring     more jobs and  prosperity to   South Bend and the surrounding areas.  And  as a matter  of fact, Pete   Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally  at  the  ELMS(Hummer) factory   last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his     radar.  *THEORY #2*:       This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor  presentation     when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks  will be used  for     municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing  of it and  said hey     just some random counties they have worked   with. The  Michigan and     Indiana seals make sense since that's where  they  are  located. And the     California ones also since that's where  most of   the former  employees   and  Seres motors was headquartered.  But then I   noticed the  top left   seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This  just so  happens  to be  right next to   my  hometown so I am very  familiar with  this area.  Why  does the   Fairfax, VA  seal appear  alongside those of  Michigan,   Indiana, and   California?  A  side note  about Fairfax  County ‚Äì it is  very  wealthy and   very liberal.  Turns  out they have  quite a few Green   Initiatives in   action. Last year   they stated that  ‚ÄúOne-hundred  percent  of eligible   county vehicles   scheduled for  purchase in fiscal  year 2021  shall be   replaced with   electric  vehicles and the  infrastructure needed  can be   supported in   fiscal  year 2021.‚Äù  Just a  few weeks ago another  article   stated  ‚ÄúFairfax   County Public Schools  is getting its first  electric    school bus today  as  part of a  statewide initiative led by  Dominion    Energy.‚Äù  Interesting! It  seems  quite obvious Fairfax County is   gearing   up  for wide scale EV   adoption, and wants to do implement it  as  soon   as  possible. Maryland  and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for  highest rate  of  EV   adoption, while  Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be  damn sure they    will  be looking to  improve on that  number.  &amp;#x200B;  [Peculiar     section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County,   VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they  are    working on?](https://preview.redd.it/o34xxz0dpph61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c87eb08d3ef475c853527e9fb240fd67547a4c8)  Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**        received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December,  the       Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads  the    state‚Äôs    economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series  of    conditional   tax  credits and training grants based on its plans  to    create new jobs   in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company‚Äôs job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**        in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment     (HBI)    tax credit program based on the company‚Äôs planned capital     investment  in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it     is an  excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.  Another     huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical       startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the      N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already       successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments       already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This  gives      them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we   compare     ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors,  ‚ÄúRivian‚Äôs  becoming     the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion,  $3  billion,‚Äù Taylor   said.   ‚ÄúIf you  think $200 million to $300  million  for product   engineering,   ours is $80  million, That‚Äôs  really just  airbags, seat   belts and   adapting to \[U.S.  safety  requirements\].  Tooling is already   in place   because SERES spent  $20  million for the  canceled SUV plans.   Earlier   post-Hummer occupants   also left some  usable equipment  behind.  ‚ÄúComing   off the existing   platform is worth  hundreds of  millions,‚Äù  Taylor said.   ‚ÄúSupplier  tooling  alone would  normally be a  couple  hundred million.‚Äù   Well,  that's a  bargain.  The institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:  ‚ñ™Alpine    Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around        $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of ELMS. One of the biggest purchases so        far.  ‚ñ™BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ‚ñ™Phoenix Holdings Ltd ‚Äì 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)  ‚ñ™Bank of America ‚Äì 70k shares (\~$1mill)  ‚ñ™Toronto Dominion Bank ‚Äì 15k shares (\~$203k)  ‚ñ™STA Wealth Management ‚Äì 13k shares (\~$176k)  ‚ñ™UBS Group ‚Äì Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)  We also have in the past month:  ‚ñ™Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.  ‚ñ™P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.  ‚ñ™Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.  ‚ñ™Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.  I     have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find       for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would  imagine      this  will get larger once there is an official merger  date.  As    investors, we would  like to see alternative revenue streams to  help     the  company grow.  ELMS has plans for a few different ways to   increase    their   business. One of the main ways is that they will  produce   their   vans  for  the entire North American market (CA and  Mexico),   Europe,  and   China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS  is   estimating a    potential upside  of $300 million. The other major  way  ELMS  will    increase revenue is  through the monitization of their   ELMS-AIR  data.    They will gather and  mine all the data and services   from their     vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable   information that other     companies will want to buy. They  will also   use this data to  optimize    and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This   data has an  estimated upside  of   around $50-100 million in increased    revenue.  As volume and sales  also   increase, they will introduce    passenger  van models, as well as  rental   or subscription based   services.  Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :  ‚ñ™No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches  ‚ñ™Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022  ‚ñ™Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market  ‚ñ™Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025  # IV. The Indiana Factory  &amp;#x200B;  [Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/a37ay5nepph61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c852006122b925ef4433e9f5cc61dc8b6630f7)  Another **MASSIVE**     way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the      production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they      will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was   originally    used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got   taken over   by  James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This   plant has the    capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually,   something that ELMS    will most likely need to  do by  next year. The   Indiana Office of    Economic Development Executive   Director Bill   Schalliol says ‚ÄúELMS has    worked out a deal with the United     Autoworkers Union, which has    represented workers at this plant in     recent years. ELMS will initially    launch with 140 workers, increasing     staffing to 450 workers when it    reaches full production on one   line of   smaller vans. Within four    years, the company could have 960   employees if   it produces a second    assembly line, manufacturing   larger sized  delivery  vans.‚Äù The    Mishawaka plant was selected   because it has been  retrofitted  already    for electric vehicle   production, and has a strong  supply chain  and    experienced workforce   available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.  Another    bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production ‚Äì      workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The      land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a     future  site  for in house manufacturing of parts.  In    addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters     with    31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200   employees    has   been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters     strategically    positions ELMS in the center of a network of   suppliers   and partners  and   provides access to one of the world‚Äôs   best   automotive talent pools.   The  state-of-the-art facility   includes an   over 15,000 square feet   prototype  lab, where ELMS plans   to assemble   initial battery pack and   electric  motor prototypes as   well as   complete pre-production vehicle   builds. ELMS  also plans  to  utilize   the facility as a customer center   where it can  work  with  customers to   understand their vehicle   specifications and   analytics  needs, as  well  as conduct test drives.     ‚ÄúIn addition to    facilitating our  growth,  the design of our new global   headquarters   will  allow for   collaboration across all aspects of our    engineering ‚Äì  from  vehicle   design, prototyping and software  development   ‚Äì and  customer    engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver  for its customers   the  most    efficient and customized solutions for  their last mile use    cases,‚Äù   said  James Taylor.  ELMS    plans to   open  additional offices in California and other   locations  in    proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs‚Äú  ELMS  plans  to build    around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more  than double   output to   9,100  vehicles in  2022 when the second  vehicle is added,  and  grow to   83,000  for both by  2025. The vehicle  and plant are said  to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.‚Äù  Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.  # V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection  Ok,    sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company      that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Sokon deez nuts.   Yes,     officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as    DFSK.   They   have been around since 2003, and are well established in   the    Chinese   auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers,   actually.    Sokon  has  a proven product and demand.  They have over   200,000 gas    models,  plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to   over 1  million   miles  driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top   of that,  they  were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**       in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a   large     customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some   legitimate     companies that even me  and you can recognize. This   includes ecommerce     delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service   for the China Post,     utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles  for  the Hong Kong     International Airport.  **Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**  This    takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our       very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was     created   in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An      interesting   side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the      cofounder and   former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin      worked before   this? A little company called Atieva, now known as     Lucid  Motors!  One  thing I   want    to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen   mentioned     regarding ‚Äúbad reviews‚Äù from employees online about  Seres    (Glassdoor I    believe). This has been cited as a reason for   concern  and    uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind  ELMS  will     function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have  here will   be    the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a  formidable   team    and workforce  together. Jim only started working  around May,  and    Seres  had already  been bleeding cash and laying  off workers.  The     combination of increasing  tensions with China and  the hardships  of     trying into expand in multiple  countries at  once, caused the  eventual     dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have  wondered also if  most of  these    reviews were due to turmoil going   on between specific  people  in the    company, such as Martin Eberhard  and  other CEOs. He  did get  into it    with meme lord Elon and that  ended up  leading to  his ousting  at Tesla.    At Seres, he also ended  up leaving them  in  less than a  year and he   took  people along with  him to another EV   startup.  Doesn't sound like   much  of a team  player.  Seres   ended up ceasing  their US operations, but has continued to  survive      overseas and has  successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be      producing a  Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad  to    be   honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.  **Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**  Well,    they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the       existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time   and      R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is       already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess  work      needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field  experience and      warranty data  from the millions of miles already  driven in these  cars.     This will give  ELMS a huge head start to  develop and improve  many     aspects of their  automated systems and  ELMS-AIR. The high  volume of     existing supplier  based contracts  will be used to their  advantage as     well. There will be  absolutely  no lack of connections  or reach that     this allstar team won't  be  able to tap into. And then  of course, the     amount of money saved  from  the Mishawaka plant and  already invested   Sokon development, is  well over  half a billion  dollars. Nice.  # VI. Is This A Chinese Company?  The     last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the       important question of: ‚ÄúIs this a Chinese company or not?‚Äù  **The short and easy answer is NO.**  **ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**  **They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**  Sokon       will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla       supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic   supply   for the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard   design    for   the batteries will be sourced in the U.S.  Unfortunately,  ELMS    cannot  go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to  transition as much  as    possible  in  the future. Right now, they are  also focused on making     sure they  can get  an attractive and  affordable price point to its     customers.  ‚ÄúHey, made  in America.  Made in Mishawaka. Half of it‚Äôs     American,‚Äù he  said. ‚ÄúOur  engineers  are here. The software guys. The     homologation is  all based in   Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to    source  the majority  of our EV   systems and componentry here in the    U.S.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be going  into  the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys.    I‚Äôd say  there‚Äôs a low   chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,‚Äù Taylor    said. ‚ÄúBut  after we‚Äôre   finished, it should  be looked at as just a  few   parts from  China.  If we  move all the way  into vertical  integration,   we‚Äôre like   everybody  else. I‚Äôm not sure we  can hang  onto that price   point.‚Äù   So as  we can  see, there is some  strategy  here at play in   order to  secure  some of  these early and first  mover  advantage   contracts.  # VII. Technical Analysis  Had       to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much       nothing  overly bearish or bullish. ELMS broke below resistance the   past   2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise   above     it and  turn it from resistance back into support.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qs601a6hpph61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25524d8b088c71fa32bd9a269bf3614a12ecc555  # VIII. Conclusion  If       you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to   China     and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become   much     more  confident and aware of the future potential of this  amazing   new    company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came  into this    looking   to  alleviate some of my worries about the  stagnant and    seemingly  void  or  negative energy surrounding this  company. I came   out  the  other end  a  changed man. They say money  doesn't grow on   trees, but   they missed  one.  The ELMS tree. And it  has acorns for all   of us.  Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img auhv7g3ipph61...*  Disclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons  Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice.

It is long but I hope you will enjoy it.    Read this all or you will die. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the   company Forum Merger 3 who is  merging with Electric Last Mile   Solutions, an EV company    specializing  in last mile delivery and work   vans. ELMS will be the first    and only  Class 1 electric vehicle on   the market, coming as early as   Q3,  with  no other Class 1 EV as   competition. They are also bringing a   Class  2  EV truck to market   next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to   be   first to market in   Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over  the   old  Hummer plant   in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of    working  with an   already successful EV company, allowing for instant     transposition of   truck plans ready for production.  ELMS    has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has      received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current  stock     price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock  other than     some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical  behavior for   most   EV companies. So what  gives?  After     doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back     most investors back from committing to this great company is their       connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a       company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not       unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the       market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,       we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any   time     we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research   has   shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be   concerned   about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite ‚Äì something that   will help   propel them   forward and accelerate their process through   previously   successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry   connections.  I.  The Team  First,      let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to    know,  a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind     ELMS  is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with   years  of   experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of   the  team   members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst  them  and  amongst   different   auto/EV companies(including a  connection to  Tesla)  . These   connections  made some of the pieces  start to fall  into  place. In   particular, I  wanted to figure out  more so their  connection  to the   Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and  something to  be concerned  about?   After digging deeper  my questions  were answered.  üì∑  The Allstars  ***The Allstars*** ***-***  **James (Jim) Taylor** ‚Äì 35+ years experience ‚Äì CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**       he pivoted the company‚Äôs focus from the electrification of cars  and      SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors,  now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working  with).      Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.       Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of    Cadillac,    which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is    the    powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a    company and    what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He    probably has    some of the most experience of anyone in the industry    when it comes  to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik  Fisker  of FSR) and    Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and    experience on developing    different types of EVs, will allow for    future design and build    improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as    ‚ÄúThe Great One‚Äù when it    comes to the EV world. He is also known as    Jim ‚ÄúThe EV Man‚Äù Taylor,    because like the show Home Improvement,  he   is always building and    innovating in the garage.  **Jason Luo** ‚Äì 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.        Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems  (now      Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety    companies    in the world.  Oversaw the company‚Äôs acquisition of Takata    Corporation    for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board  of   directors of    Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATCDrivetrain and    Sybridge  Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive    world and  more   importantly with large companies. In addition he  has   been  through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is  an   added  benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.  **Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,       Inc .  She previously led Google‚Äôs automotive services program,     during   which time she released Google products, including Google  Maps,    into   automakers‚Äô new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has  served on    the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd  largest  auto   dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that  she is  the   co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**       (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation      industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I      found on  their group website was called ‚ÄúHigh-Potential Regions for      Electric  Truck Deployments‚Äù. It talked about geographical areas they      want to  focus on and develop ‚Äì one of them being the Great Lakes.   Guess    where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great   Lakes.     This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she   can use    this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the   industry.    Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an   EV truck demo    for data collection  and analytics, and two of the   companies already    involved are  Lightning E-motors and  Workhorse.  **Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,        during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also       helped expand the company‚Äôs international  footprint in many   European     and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS   get some     international connections. Hes overseen numerous   acquisitions, as well     as being a leading member of the team that   managed UPS‚Äôs IPO in 1999,   at   the time the largest in U.S. history.   He is no stranger to     understanding what it takes to make a new   operation a successful one.  **Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.       Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving      company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign      from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an      employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!      Brian currently serves  on the boards of amsAG and Footprint US      (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere      &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as      serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go      to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will  help     with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as  their on     board ELMS-AIR system (more on this later).  **Neil Goldberg**,      - 45+ yrs ‚Äì Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;      Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing,     merchandising  and general management experience.  **David Boris ‚Äì**      30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been      involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,      underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef,  Inc.,     which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation  in  October    2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being  one  company   that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I   think the   food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady  in  price ever   since merger  completion. This bodes well for  ELMS.  The Players  ***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***  ***Jerry Hu***      ‚Äì 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and     Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other     management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**  ***Justin Prann*** ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.  ***Kev Adjemian*** **‚Äì** 20+ years ‚Äì CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**  ***Albert Li*** ‚Äì 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.  ***Benjamin Wu***      ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head   for    Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international      corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.  So      as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent       connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and  other      places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies  that  are     connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS,  tell  me   that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings.  This team    covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top  contender  in   the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience,  have held  top   level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the  knowledge  and   know-how in  many  different aspects of electric  vehicles and the    industry overall.  II. What Does ELMS Do?  Now      that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they     do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial      delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV     companies  include:  ‚ñ™First and     Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE     for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of     being alone  in the field.  ‚ñ™Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production  ‚ñ™Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later  ‚ñ™Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1  ‚ñ™Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China  Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note ‚Äì this is from December so it may have changed some since.  Only Class 1 - no other competition  The      ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline      counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo   space   ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by    35% (50%    compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around    $1550 for   ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It    becomes   even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per    cubic ft   that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft.   It  appears   that they  have plans to make different variations of   their  Class 1  and  Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as   well  based off   individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to   200 miles  and be   capable of a  full recharge in as little as two   hours. These  types of   vans are used in  many capacities of our   society. For example,  delivery   and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL),   communications (Verizon,    Comcast), small  businesses (local flower   shop, food trucks), and    utility and local  municipality vehicles.   There is no lack of demand for    these types of  vehicles.  A    cool  feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS   that  I   think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the    vans   themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to  a     specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that   business.    This includes  things like installing custom drawers and   cabinets,    shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical   upfitting process    involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous   different ones, and    takes on avg 130-140  days from order to   delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :  ‚ñ™ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery  ‚ñ™ One warranty single point of contact for customer  ‚ñ™   Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently     in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and    Auto   Truck Group.  I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.  üì∑  Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.  Next,    the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS -AIR,    an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much      information about any specifics except for some clues in their     investor   presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems     in   partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many     benefits  to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :  ‚ñ™Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles  ‚ñ™Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance  ‚ñ™Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports  ‚ñ™Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins  Some      of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla    for   example, are the ability for the software updates to happen      frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in      communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be      collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be.    The   experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel    will    be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a    system   like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies    buying it.   For example, there  will be savings from being able to    easily collect   accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers.    Time will also be   saved with something  such as the automated  updates   and knowing exactly   when a van will need  to be serviced or   inspected.  As time goes on and   more data becomes  collected, the   ELMS-AIR  service will only prove to  be  more valuable for  both the   company and  their customers.  III. Sales and Financials  The      ELMS team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection     with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at     closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to     fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional   capital     requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash   flow.     With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that  gives  us    $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total  of     142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of  $12, gives     us $1.71  billion.  ELMS     currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing  a    revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000  orders by    the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in   talks with or    have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +   Siemens (cant  make   that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.   These  contracts   will work directly with  companies such as Ikea,  Best  Buy,  Walmart,   Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and  connections of   the team will   no doubt lead to more  contracts in the  future.  The  ELMS  business plan  includes a conservative volume ramp, with     approximately  4,000  vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth     quarter of 2021,   accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in     2022, and   approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. ‚ÄúOur team     collectively has   decades of experience launching vehicles for global     OEMs, and so  while  the facility has an annual production capacity of     100,000  units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial  volumes    so  that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new  brand,     establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.‚Äù  I   have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000      preorders  being ‚Äúcontingent upon satisfaction of customer      requirements.‚Äù As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more      than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its      Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give   the    customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I   would    expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon   counterpart.  üì∑  Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.  **\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*  *THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.       Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the       mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed       results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis  on      creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where  the  new     ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to  South Bend  in    the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible  that ELMS  will    have  first priority now for any new government  contracts  relating to  EV   delivery or services, or maybe additional   funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to   electrify the US, and now Mayor    Pete has a perfect opportunity to   give back to his hometown and bring     more jobs and prosperity to   South Bend and the surrounding areas.  And  as a matter of fact, Pete   Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally  at  the ELMS(Hummer) factory   last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his    radar.  *THEORY #2*:      This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation     when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used  for     municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and  said hey     just some random counties they have worked  with. The  Michigan and     Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are  located. And the     California ones also since that's where most of   the former  employees   and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I   noticed the  top left   seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so  happens  to be  right next to   my  hometown so I am very familiar with  this area.  Why  does the   Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of  Michigan,   Indiana, and   California?  A  side note about Fairfax  County ‚Äì it is  very  wealthy and   very liberal.  Turns out they have  quite a few Green   Initiatives in   action. Last year  they stated that  ‚ÄúOne-hundred  percent  of eligible   county vehicles  scheduled for  purchase in fiscal  year 2021  shall be   replaced with  electric  vehicles and the  infrastructure needed  can be   supported in  fiscal  year 2021.‚Äù  Just a  few weeks ago another  article   stated ‚ÄúFairfax   County Public Schools  is getting its first  electric   school bus today  as  part of a  statewide initiative led by  Dominion   Energy.‚Äù  Interesting! It  seems  quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing   up  for wide scale EV   adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon   as  possible. Maryland  and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of  EV   adoption, while  Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they    will  be looking to  improve on that  number.  Peculiar    section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County,  VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are    working on?  Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**       received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the       Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the    state‚Äôs    economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of    conditional   tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to    create new jobs   in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company‚Äôs job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**       in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment    (HBI)    tax credit program based on the company‚Äôs planned capital    investment  in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it    is an  excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.  Another    huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical      startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the     N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already      successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments      already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives      them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we  compare     ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, ‚ÄúRivian‚Äôs  becoming     the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3  billion,‚Äù Taylor   said.   ‚ÄúIf you  think $200 million to $300 million  for product   engineering,   ours is $80  million, That‚Äôs really just  airbags, seat   belts and   adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\].  Tooling is already   in place   because SERES spent  $20 million for the  canceled SUV plans.   Earlier   post-Hummer occupants  also left some  usable equipment  behind.  ‚ÄúComing   off the existing  platform is worth  hundreds of  millions,‚Äù  Taylor said.   ‚ÄúSupplier tooling  alone would  normally be a  couple  hundred million.‚Äù   Well, that's a  bargain.  The institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:  ‚ñ™Alpine   Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around       $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of ELMS. One of the biggest purchases so       far.  ‚ñ™BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ‚ñ™Phoenix Holdings Ltd ‚Äì 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)  ‚ñ™Bank of America ‚Äì 70k shares (\~$1mill)  ‚ñ™Toronto Dominion Bank ‚Äì 15k shares (\~$203k)  ‚ñ™STA Wealth Management ‚Äì 13k shares (\~$176k)  ‚ñ™UBS Group ‚Äì Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)  We also have in the past month:  ‚ñ™Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.  ‚ñ™P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.  ‚ñ™Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.  ‚ñ™Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.  I    have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find      for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine      this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.  As    investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help     the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to   increase    their  business. One of the main ways is that they will  produce   their   vans for  the entire North American market (CA and  Mexico),   Europe,  and  China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS  is   estimating a   potential upside  of $300 million. The other major  way  ELMS  will   increase revenue is  through the monitization of their   ELMS-AIR  data.   They will gather and  mine all the data and services   from their    vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable   information that other    companies will want to buy. They  will also   use this data to optimize    and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This   data has an estimated upside  of   around $50-100 million in increased    revenue. As volume and sales  also   increase, they will introduce    passenger van models, as well as  rental   or subscription based   services.  Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :  ‚ñ™No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches  ‚ñ™Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022  ‚ñ™Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market  ‚ñ™Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025  IV. The Indiana Factory  Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.  Another **MASSIVE**    way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the     production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they     will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was  originally    used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got  taken over   by  James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This  plant has the    capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually,  something that ELMS    will most likely need to  do by  next year. The  Indiana Office of    Economic Development Executive   Director Bill  Schalliol says ‚ÄúELMS has    worked out a deal with the United    Autoworkers Union, which has    represented workers at this plant in    recent years. ELMS will initially    launch with 140 workers, increasing    staffing to 450 workers when it    reaches full production on one  line of   smaller vans. Within four    years, the company could have 960  employees if   it produces a second    assembly line, manufacturing  larger sized  delivery  vans.‚Äù The    Mishawaka plant was selected  because it has been  retrofitted  already    for electric vehicle  production, and has a strong  supply chain  and    experienced workforce  available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.  Another   bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production ‚Äì     workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The     land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a    future  site  for in house manufacturing of parts.  In   addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters    with    31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200  employees    has   been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters    strategically    positions ELMS in the center of a network of  suppliers   and partners  and   provides access to one of the world‚Äôs  best   automotive talent pools.   The  state-of-the-art facility  includes an   over 15,000 square feet   prototype  lab, where ELMS plans  to assemble   initial battery pack and   electric  motor prototypes as  well as   complete pre-production vehicle   builds. ELMS  also plans to  utilize   the facility as a customer center   where it can  work with  customers to   understand their vehicle   specifications and  analytics  needs, as  well  as conduct test drives.     ‚ÄúIn addition to   facilitating our  growth,  the design of our new global   headquarters  will  allow for   collaboration across all aspects of our   engineering ‚Äì  from  vehicle   design, prototyping and software development   ‚Äì and  customer    engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers   the  most    efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use    cases,‚Äù   said  James Taylor.  ELMS   plans to   open  additional offices in California and other  locations  in    proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs‚Äú ELMS  plans  to build    around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double   output to   9,100  vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added,  and  grow to   83,000  for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said  to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.‚Äù  Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.  V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection  Ok,   sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company     that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Sokon deez nuts.  Yes,     officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as   DFSK.   They   have been around since 2003, and are well established in  the    Chinese   auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers,  actually.    Sokon  has  a proven product and demand.  They have over  200,000 gas    models,  plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to  over 1  million   miles  driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top  of that,  they  were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**      in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a  large     customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some  legitimate     companies that even me  and you can recognize. This  includes ecommerce     delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service  for the China Post,     utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for  the Hong Kong     International Airport.  **Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**  This   takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our      very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was    created   in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An     interesting   side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the     cofounder and   former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin     worked before   this? A little company called Atieva, now known as    Lucid  Motors!  One  thing I  want    to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen  mentioned     regarding ‚Äúbad reviews‚Äù from employees online about  Seres   (Glassdoor I    believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern  and    uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will     function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will   be    the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable   team    and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May,  and    Seres  had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers.  The     combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships  of     trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the  eventual     dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if  most of  these    reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific  people  in the    company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He  did get  into it    with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to  his ousting  at Tesla.    At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in  less than a  year and he   took  people along with him to another EV   startup.  Doesn't sound like   much  of a team player.  Seres   ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive      overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be      producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad  to    be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.  **Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**  Well,   they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the      existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and      R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is      already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work      needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and      warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these  cars.     This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve  many     aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS-AIR. The high  volume of     existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their  advantage as     well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections  or reach that     this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then  of course, the     amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and  already invested   Sokon development, is well over  half a billion  dollars. Nice.  VI. Is This A Chinese Company?  The    last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the      important question of: ‚ÄúIs this a Chinese company or not?‚Äù  **The short and easy answer is NO.**  **ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**  **They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**  Sokon      will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla      supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply   for the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design    for   the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS    cannot  go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as    possible  in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making     sure they  can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its     customers.  ‚ÄúHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it‚Äôs     American,‚Äù he  said. ‚ÄúOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The     homologation is  all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to    source  the majority  of our EV  systems and componentry here in the    U.S.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be going  into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys.    I‚Äôd say  there‚Äôs a low  chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,‚Äù Taylor    said. ‚ÄúBut  after we‚Äôre  finished, it should  be looked at as just a  few   parts from  China. If we  move all the way  into vertical  integration,   we‚Äôre like  everybody  else. I‚Äôm not sure we  can hang  onto that price   point.‚Äù  So as  we can  see, there is some  strategy  here at play in   order to secure  some of  these early and first  mover  advantage   contracts.  VII. Technical Analysis  Had      to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much      nothing  overly bearish or bullish. ELMS broke below resistance the  past   2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise  above     it and  turn it from resistance back into support.  üì∑VIII. Conclusion  If      you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China     and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much     more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing   new    company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this    looking   to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and    seemingly  void  or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came   out  the  other end  a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on   trees, but   they missed  one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all   of us.  Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.  üì∑  The ELMS tree  Disclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons  Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice. Do your own dd.

I'm putting rocket emojis just for you guys! I know you love them  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**   TLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual.   Yesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data).   Ill wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share.   Today I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.    1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **üöÄ**   Small side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel.   2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**   3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**   Expect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.  4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**   5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)).   In any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share.   Further if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**   I get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality.   Don't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.    You see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.  Come back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share.   I reiterate my position:  1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.     **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|9041615|public|confidence|self|||INTC - Catalysts for a breakout of all time high and the road to Trillion dollar market cap üöÄüöÄüöÄ|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljx97i/intc_catalysts_for_a_breakout_of_all_time_high/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-02-14|GM

Although entertaining, ‚ÄúNIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!‚Äù comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it‚Äôs cold AF outside.  So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don‚Äôt like these stocks.  **1. Positions**  [https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.  A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.  **2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**  Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.  Current PS as of 2/10/2021  \- TSLA: \~25  \- NIO: \~40  \- XPENG: \~41  \- LI: \~19 (It‚Äôs because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)  Let‚Äôs compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let‚Äôs look at high margin tech anyways.  \- NFLX: \~10  \- ABNB: \~28  \- PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)  Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma‚Äôs teets  \- TM: \~0.8  \- F: \~0.4  \- VWAGY: \~0.5  I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don‚Äôt ask me how I did that, the answer either won‚Äôt impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what‚Äôs important right now.  Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn‚Äôt change  \- TSLA: \~22  \- NIO: \~29  \- XPENG: \~26  \- LI: \~14  Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it‚Äôs 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king‚Äôs girlfriend.  Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.  Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.  **3. Revenue Growth Stunted**  You might be one of those Stocktwats and you‚Äôre thinking; ‚Äúbut but... they‚Äôll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!‚Äù \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won‚Äôt and here is why.  Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They‚Äôre not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn‚Äôt stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.  Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you‚Äôre not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug‚Äôs closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.  TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you‚Äôre not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?  NIO: 100% SUVs  Xpeng: 40% SUVs  Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking ‚ÄúWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.‚Äù Fine, let‚Äôs take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.  Let‚Äôs break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs  Tesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800  \- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)  \- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s  \- Charger network: 20,000+  NIO EC6  \- Price: \~$57,200  \- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)  \- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s  \- Charger network: 290+  Xpeng G3 520  \- Price: \~$30,580  \- Range: 520 km  \- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s  \- Charger network: 866+  You may be thinking the G3 520‚Äôs price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you‚Äôll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.  ‚ÄúBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It‚Äôs perfect for China‚Äôs dense cities!‚Äù If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That‚Äôs why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I‚Äôd rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can‚Äôt even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I‚Äôm Chinese and know some first hand) don‚Äôt want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.  Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.  Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla‚Äôs network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.  ‚ÄúBut JJ‚Ä¶ China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!‚Äù Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.  Solar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn‚Äôt make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.  Oh and let‚Äôs not forget about autonomy‚Ä¶ no, let‚Äôs forget about it (for now).  International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a ""made in china"" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.  Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it‚Äôll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.  **4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**  History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was ""made in china"" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).  Let‚Äôs look at the current state of margins.  Q3 2020 Gross Margins  \- Tesla: 23.5%  \- Nio: 12.9%  \- Xpeng: 4.6%  \- Li Auto: 19.8%  We‚Äôll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it‚Äôs not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla‚Äôs solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.  ‚ÄúBut JJ, that‚Äôs not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!‚Äù First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier ‚Äúramp‚Äù years.  2017: 18.9%  2016: 22.8%  2015: 22.8%  This may not look right, something must be wrong you‚Äôre thinking. Well, let‚Äôs we take a look under the hood, you won‚Äôt find Trayvon Martin.  \- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the ‚Äúskateboard‚Äù design, saying it‚Äôs obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!  \- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.  [https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)  Can you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?  \- Tesla‚Äôs electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.  \- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron‚Äôs fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.  \- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.  \- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources  \- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network  \- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*  \- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn‚Äôt trust Nio and Xpeng‚Äôs software with your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs life  **5. Closing**  Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let‚Äôs not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?  CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.  I‚Äôm no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it‚Äôs peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I‚Äôll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.  At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I‚Äôve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.  TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng.

Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between vehicles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We are a **premier provider** of AI- powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles, including one of the world‚Äôs most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants, such as ‚ÄúHey BMW‚Äù and ‚ÄúNi hao Banma‚Äù.     **Market Capitalization:**      Cerence has a market cap of just **$5 billion**. As a play on two of the hottest growth segments (EV and AI), Cerence has and likely will continue to see prolific growth.       **Customer Profile:**      **CERENCE products are in 53% OF ALL NEW CARS SHIPPED in 2020. This equates to 38 MILLION cars alone in 2020 and 325 million vehicles to date.**         Customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including BMW, Daimler, FCA Group, Ford, Geely, GM, Renault-Nissan, SAIC, Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, DENSO TEN and Harman. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between their brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone.         **Competitive Strengths: ** (directly from 10K)      **Industry-leading speech-related technology**        **Hybrid edge-cloud system architecture** Our software platform‚Äôs hybrid architecture combines the performance, reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity.       **Bespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning** Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation, entertainment and control require tight integration with onboard vehicle components, which vary widely among vehicle models. Separately, speech interaction systems can be significantly hampered by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components. To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns, our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models.       **Broad language coverage** Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects, far more than any of our competitors. As a result of our broad language support, our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform in over 60 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including China, the U.S. and all other large automotive markets. Our language support also enables multi-lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection, point-of-interest selection, and cross-border navigation among others, representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones. We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi-lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage, as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time-consuming.       **Broad, global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers** We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years, working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands.       **Competitors:** A real DD always addresses the competitive landscape.     **Large technology companies** Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, offer Internet-based virtual assistants. Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants, we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience.        **Small, focused competitors** We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice-based virtual assistance, including SoundHound in the U.S., iFlyTek in China, and other regional and technology-focused competitors. These companies have had some success selling into our customer base. However, we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages, including our scale, our globally distributed team, our best-in-class portfolio of compatible languages, and our deep focus on the automotive market. We also believe that our technology, particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning, is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors. We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings.       **Competitors (My analysis):**       I appreciate that Cerence's auditors make sure they address all potential risks. However, I do not see big tech as a threat. I see them as a ""gain-guarantee."" Cerence's AI is years ahead of the big players and Cerence‚Äôs small peers. The biggest risk I see here is that a company--ahem like AAPL or Google--might purchase Cerence. Cerence's market cap makes it a likely candidate of a buyout in the future.        **Revenues:**       Revenues are up to $326 Million for fiscal year 2020. **$95 Million in Q1 2021** literally on pace for 25% revenue growth. [Here‚Äôs a chart with Revenue growth for the last three years]( https://imgur.com/a/eNKnHnR)        **Gross Margin:**     72% gross margin in the most recent fiscal quarter. Huge margins which is extremely attractive.    **Research and Development:**       The best expense on the income statement in my opinion. Cerence has had negative net incomes in the past few fiscal years due primarily to R&amp;D costs. This maintains and expands their already vast competitive advantage.       ‚ÄúWe believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market-leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities.‚Äù    **Balance Sheet:**      $1,700,000,000 assets to $700,000,000 liabilities.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.  The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn‚Äôt my native language. I will try my best.  **Palantir as a Company ‚Äì the beginnings**  PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this ‚Äì Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government‚Ä¶.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.  You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji‚Äôs to pump your dopamine and keep you happy.  Let‚Äôs start with the DD  First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.  &amp;#x200B;  * **1. The Management**  Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won‚Äôt be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.  &amp;#x200B;  * **2. PLTR Business model/ products**  Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don‚Äôt have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don‚Äôt fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers‚Äô base isn‚Äôt neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That‚Äôs the reason why their products aren‚Äôt so tangible for many people.  PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn‚Äôt sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called ‚ÄúGraham‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:  First example is Syria with Graham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù for you. But this wasn‚Äôt so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information‚Äôs are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.  [https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)  Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.  In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way  ‚ÄúGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.‚Äù  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)  The second example is about ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù and it‚Äôs directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)  ‚ÄúAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.‚Äù  Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù with data.  The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  * **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**  Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)  But this didn‚Äôt happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like ‚Äûlook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions‚Äú. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn‚Äôt get the contracts. This was also the ‚Äûswamp ‚Äûtrump was talking about.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)  [https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)  A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.  *Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*  [https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)  Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn‚Äôt possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.  [https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)  [https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)  How it‚Äôs ended? Well Peter‚Äôs wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and ‚Äûbest practices ‚Äûin the government  [https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)  [https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)  PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.  &amp;#x200B;  * **4. Valuation problems**  I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it‚Äôs not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It‚Äôs a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.  Let‚Äôs talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn‚Äôt tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.  Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.  PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)  Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.  These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it‚Äôs difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can‚Äôt ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.  This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.  [https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)  How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don‚Äôt understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don‚Äôt have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don‚Äôt understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That‚Äôs why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn‚Äôt happened yet. That‚Äôs why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.  Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn‚Äôt possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.  Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I‚Äôm not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash‚Ä¶  On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.  PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it‚Äôs miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don‚Äôt understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR  &amp;#x200B;  * **5. Risks for PLTR**  Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: ‚ÄúWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.‚Äù The S1 Form didn‚Äôt aged well. Actually I don‚Äôt think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.  As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn‚Äôt rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.  I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.  There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can‚Äôt avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It‚Äôs a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.  The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren‚Äôt relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn‚Äôt profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù.  [https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)  But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000¬ß. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.  &amp;#x200B;  * **6. Conclusion and Outlook**  If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let‚Äôs connect the dots and bring this information to a point  1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off! 2. Military expenditures rising worldwide  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2  [https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)  With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.  3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don‚Äôt have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don‚Äôt work with it but big Institutions does.  Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:  ‚ÄúThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public ‚Äî fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars ‚Äî will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.‚Äù  4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don‚Äôt know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.  Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn‚Äôt had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.  A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before‚Ä¶.  PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.  5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It‚Äôs not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I‚Äôm not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don‚Äôt need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.  I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.  If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..  **What‚Äôs next?**  Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.  For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.  The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don‚Äôt got the GM deal? The stock tanked ‚Äì for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.  But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don‚Äôt expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.  I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3√ü. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don‚Äôt think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid ‚Äì long term.  What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don‚Äôt do any market activity based on my DD. I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.  My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized ‚Äúthe pumpers‚Äù. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don‚Äôt do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.  1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology. 2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs. 3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road. 4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)  Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)  Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued.

Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):  \- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon‚Äôs cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.  * Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company‚Äôs [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‚ÄòApollo‚Äô autonomous driving open platform. * BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry‚Äôs QNX technology. * BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles. * BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**  **Okay, so why is this important?**  1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles. 2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.** 3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\* 4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**  Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.  **The Sobering Part of this DD:**  After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they‚Äôre not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.  I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**  **Final Thoughts:**  Here‚Äôs what the skeptics don‚Äôt realize though. They don‚Äôt realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it‚Äôs a phone company. Well, it‚Äôs not.  With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry‚Äôs **future growth**.  Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it‚Äôll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it‚Äôs not a meme stock.**|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8981382|public|confidence|self|||BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixji/blackberry_is_not_a_meme_stock/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'OXo73__Au4pvEy7nmnUPn4a_8Lad4MavAdla3GcUDW0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mxB_kPiLJcSmlSM7m2UjYg-IjKC5wQElXZAjkdKhJ5Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bec66f671fe51b28f9152e8ac506f8de502757f6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mxB_kPiLJcSmlSM7m2UjYg-IjKC5wQElXZAjkdKhJ5Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bdc1ca540fa078efb34afcf3c4451a7cd8ad5c1', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 296, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mxB_kPiLJcSmlSM7m2UjYg-IjKC5wQElXZAjkdKhJ5Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=561ad0aa3560e613b7a46ae848e2aae81aacf5c3', 'width': 296}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-02-12|GM

everyone,  I'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it.   In any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here's GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:  * AMC * ATVI * GM * GME * JPM * SNDL * SNOW * TSLA * UPS * V   The criteria was just ""fairly popular stocks"", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.   I left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.   What I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a ""sign"" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes. [Here's an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You'll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%.   Here's a general definition of R^2 :  &gt;R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.  Here are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):  * AMC: 0.6766 * ATVI: 0.579 * GM: 0.0012 * GME: 0.907 * JPM: 0.6203 * SNDL: 0.3488 * SNOW: 0.0948 * TSLA: 0.7087 * UPS: 0.6852 * V: 0.39   I believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current ""reasoning"" for holding is that there's a lot of ""weird"" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as ""maybe it's this, maybe it's that"". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).  PS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.  #####EDIT: If anyone knows a safe, **anonymous**, way of sharing this data, I'm happy to post it"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8877836|public|confidence|self|||[GME] Volume vs Price Linear Regression Analysis.

Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak  &gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.  &gt; * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.  *****  &gt; # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4  &gt; * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.  &gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM‚Äôs crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.  *****  &gt; # 3. Twitter is ‚Äòbigger than any one account,‚Äô CEO says  &gt; * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is ‚Äúbigger than any one account,‚Äù said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.  *****  &gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments  &gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial.

Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking.

Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future  2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.  Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).  THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).  This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto  u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX  QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.  Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.  Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?  SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.  You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations.

It‚Äôs a little EV company called Stellantis (STLA). Stellantis is an EV manufacturing corporation with deals with companies such as FCA and Peugeot. It just recently opened for public trading on the market. They plan to have 39 different EVs made by 2022.   What makes this pick so great in my opinion is, of course, Joe Biden. Not just Biden being there, however. Joe Biden has announced plans to convert the entire federal fleet into EVs. What company does the federal government use for the most part? Dodge, *which is owned by FCA*. With Stellantis very likely producing these EVs, we could see a very healthy surge in the company‚Äôs value.   Pretty short DD, I know, but I think this has the potential to be a great long term pick.

But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.  **It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.  If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.  If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.  **Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.  **So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.  GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.  So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).  **Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8654332|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yUPF36QA8X7Jwh6JfpHvll3STCUOROwTiMW5DlOGJYs.jpg|140.0|140.0|Ford: It's a data company now?|1.0|[]|0.74|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchkzz/ford_its_a_data_company_now/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'ZnTZHbRcOd3ny5e3nC3K7Rr_qyXE2pDO1yWDndxZu2s', 'resolutions': [{'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a2021cdb88ecd9807b7294904b3800915946114', 'width': 108}, {'height': 288, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1caf7ff0afa68c06854c32a8ee3280721c1c1622', 'width': 216}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36011f075d6930ce362f23138cb0037574d83a34', 'width': 320}, {'height': 853, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e44d5c99cd7593b8ae5b80fd914e6a1ec4794a9d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec60175c2e427ae833d69fbc688b0e9617f4b53e', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1440, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e24c49ef3b10b951b8363bb8cb3a4806ca13f1', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1600, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/_0lTKztQrCYytDUkE6AfI0K_gIiG9go5wmnSdLtRb2Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=278d97e0860c8cde1aab65d804dc0133575d1a21', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}|||1612451627.0|||||||||2021-02-04|GM

Just a thought I had. We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers have been saying it‚Äôs overvalued for the last I don‚Äôt know how long, or in a bubble (which, in all reality could be true).  However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft, Ford pairing with Google, and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the EV bandwagon.   This got me thinking. Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford‚Äôs market cap is literally half of NIO‚Äôs (who has 7,000 employees). It‚Äôs hard to justify, in my mind at least.  I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional automakers  have in comparison to these other startups gives them a HUGE advantage.  But now that these guys are finally making their own EV‚Äôs, I think investors are starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well in the near future.  I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but very rarely that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an ‚Äúenergy company‚Äù and blah blah blah. What do y‚Äôall think? Am I stupid?

They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again.  But. It‚Äôs a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didn‚Äôt have Twitter. 2008 didn‚Äôt have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that ‚Äúprotect‚Äù peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass.   It‚Äôs not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid.   What they have attempted to do is criminal. It‚Äôs not 2008.  The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I don‚Äôt think anybody expected. Especially in 2021.   I‚Äôm holding. I don‚Äôt want to. This isn‚Äôt an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that it‚Äôs simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.  To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.  I cannot in good faith sell and leave everyone standing alone trying to do the right thing.

(**[**https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XL)**)**  However I wanna have a closer look at the company itself and why it could be a good investment for short/medium term gains, because that's why we are playing this game called stock market.  XL Fleet ($XL) transforms existing commercial vehicles, e.g. small trucks into electric vehicles. Unlike many SPACs, they have an actual product that is already battle tested, and yes, it has also produced revenue. Revenue, that is set to increased **exponentially** as mentioned below. Now here are couple of interesting points that made me a believer:  * $350m in cash with NO material debt * Run by MIT alumnis with CEO's impressive records at McKinsey, GM * Jon Ledecky as board member - he's the majority owner at NY Islanders and the company he founded in the 90's was the fastest entrant to Fortune 500 * Two analyst recently began coverage with $30 PT. Current share price as of 31.1. is $18.98 * 2024 revenue forecast is $1.377 billion; current market cap $2.493B ! -&gt; company says accessible market is 1 trillion $ * EBITDA positive results projected for 2022 * All government vehicles to be turned electric - XL has the fastest solution to this and they've already known to have collaborated with public institutions * Other customers include e.g. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Verizon, DHL * PIPE shares that were unleashed in the market recently created lot of downward pressure for the stock - that should be over soon * Hyped by Cramer, gave a lot of Mad Money air time going through their business case  Price targets and analyst coverages:  * BTIG initiated analyst coverage with $30 PT:[https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231730&amp;headline=XL-XL-Fleet-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-BTIG](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231730&amp;headline=XL-XL-Fleet-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-BTIG)    * Canaccord sees XL Fleet going to $30 per share due to 'first mover' advantage:[https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237228&amp;headline=XL-Canaccord-sees-XL-Fleet-going-to--per-share-on-firstmover-advantage](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237228&amp;headline=XL-Canaccord-sees-XL-Fleet-going-to--per-share-on-firstmover-advantage)     This is not an investment advice and I recommend you all do your DD. All kinds of discussion is very welcomed, thanks am out.  EDIT: GME to the moon with diamond hands. However this should be an interesting play moving forward so keep an eye on my boys at $XL whether it's before or after GME saga is over  Edit 2: I recommend you all check the backgrounds of CEO Dimitri Kazarinoff, founder Tod Hynes and board member Jon Ledecky.

I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion. Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).  Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19  There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls  1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr! 2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently)  3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video) 4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars). 5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet  It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8608757|public|confidence|self|||Fuck TSLA, NIO, and GM -&gt; Go for Ford üöÄüöÄüíé|0.0|[]|0.43|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjl9e/fuck_tsla_nio_and_gm_go_for_ford/|some_ads|7|||||1612344222.0|||||||||2021-02-03|GM

I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.  Desktop Metal (DM) DD  DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.  The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.  Pros :  1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.  2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.  3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.  4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.  5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.  6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.  7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.  8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.  9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.  Cons :  1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.  2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc  (More cons are welcome)  My positions:  100 shares at $21.35  7 calls for $40 05/21, 9 calls for $35 05/21, 1 call for $20 05/21  Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!  Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.  PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.  Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.  **GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**  I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is &gt; than $500M but I'm wetahded.  So I titled this ""WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?"" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with **üöÄ**ü¶çüåàüêªüíéüôåüèΩ.  They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.  Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.  GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a &gt;$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.  **Financials**  Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made &gt;$8B in 2018 and 2017.  They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&amp;A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&amp;A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.  **Valuation**  This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&amp;A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&amp;A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).  So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&amp;A = $800M in operating income.  Assuming \~30% tax rate =&gt; $560M in net income.  If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...  Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|8583811|public|confidence|self|||WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?|1.0|[]|0.47|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb3tz7/wsb_potential_for_activism_in_gme/|some_ads|7||||||1.0||||||||2021-02-02|GM

First of all this chart is one gigantic ascending fucking triangle, üêÇüêÇüêÇ. That‚Äôs insanely bullish.  Second the company is sound and has some first mover advantages. First to market EV pickup, The Endurance, expected September 2021. Purchased an GM plant with the capability of producing 600k vehicles a year to help speed up production.   Third the environment is right. Biden wants the US government to use a 100% EV fleet.  Earnings are expected on 2/15 where they‚Äôre pre orders will probably blow expectations out of the water once again, and any mention of a potential government contract would send the stock soaring.

some of you have noticed that the SEC publishes data for failure to deliver numbers for each symbol every day.    After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.  I downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.  It yields some interesting results:  EDIT: Blue lines are # total collective failures on that date, green line is closing price   GME: https://i.imgur.com/dvqlgib.png   AMC: https://i.imgur.com/OLymQ4j.png  For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than *something is fucky*.   We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:  GM: https://i.imgur.com/7d96w7B.png  Now IF these failures are coming from a handful of firms (SEC / DTCC should have that data..), I would say it is quite evident of intentional naked selling to manipulate the markets.  But ~~I'm not an expert~~ _I am a smoothbrained retard ape_ and would love to hear from anyone who understands this better than I do.

your pitchforks and stop raging at Robinhood and read about the next moonshot for 5 min...  TLDR for you retards who don‚Äôt have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.  **Summary** üöÄüöÄ  XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.  **The players**üöÄüöÄ  Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.  Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.  Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.  **Application**üöÄüöÄ  The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here‚Äôs how:  - XL‚Äôs hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.  - Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.  - XL grid is XL‚Äôs charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites.   These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.  ** Other Info**üöÄüöÄ  - On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine  - Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola.   - The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a ‚ÄúBuy America‚Äù executive order that creates new guidelines for the government‚Äôs $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity  üöÄüöÄ- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. üöÄüöÄ  **TLDR**  XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).

It is sad that Robinhood has had multiple outages in the past, not allowing any users to trade.  It is embarrassing and frustrating that they took money from Citadel and are protecting them by limiting your trades, even with trades for GM and SBUX !!!!   The only thing that is good about Robinhood is that it enforced the brokerage game to revolutionize with zero fee commission and allowing the opportunity to buy portions of stocks.   I‚Äôve been with Schwab for years, and it has the same features Robinhood has now. Yea, sure the app isn‚Äôt as pleasing as Robinhood‚Äôs but Schwab offers their insight and research on stocks. I‚Äôve heard that Robinhood charges for research, but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.   Also Robinhood did not disclose the fact they were selling order flow until they got caught and are being sued. I hope that all of you Robinhood traders sue Robinhood for everything from outages, to selling order flow and to the latest restrictions.

Ryan &amp; the board are likely aware of the subreddit, and there's a lot of attention on it, so maybe in addition to highlighting how much WE LIKE THE STOCK we could also cold pitch some growth opportunities.  I really love the new CEO and board changes, as a Gamestop customer in my youth I even applied to it as my second job. I applied as a store manager, without any managing experience, at 16, because I loved games. I filled out the application and stapled a second, lined notebook paper to the application, which was my ""why do you want to work here"" answer. It was a really long passionate diatribe about my Counterstrike skills developing our clan both during tournaments as well as while we're not gaming by hosting LAN parties and activities. I was serious and was crushed I didn't get a callback. I worked in IS/IT for a few years and moved on. I work in tech now and I have an MBA, and oddly before this week I would never thought to pitch to Gamestop, but I love the idea of pitching Gamestop.  Why? Gamestop was a portal to reach totally random kids who loved everything I did. We used to all harass our parents to take us to two places: local LAN party joints or Gamestop. We didn't have any money, it was essentially a dumping ground for poor kids, but we'd be respectful of both businesses. Yeah you could meet strangers online, but that's weird (or weirder now than it was then) and I am STILL friends with people I met at LAN parties and Gamestop.  There's a lot of potential for physical retail spaces and there's time during Covid19 to transform those before we reopen this bitch with a brand new $20B Gamestop in 2021/2022.  Could we remake LAN parties, arcades, all the grimey old 80's spaces that slowly were demolished through the late 90's? The lifeblood of America? Yes we brought gaming ""home,"" and sold more consumer devices, but we lost the in-person human experience. Can we write Gamestop into Stranger Things and every other TV/movie coming out in the next two years to boost the hype train? Yes.  What if the game/console sales went the Chewy model (with local pickup if shipping to a residence isn't possible) and the new albeit small retail space was used for game, console, but also STEM/educational programming, bring Black Girls Code in and be inclusive, gamers aren't all blond white boys. My nieces and nephews don't want, despite all my efforts, to play just Warhammer 40k as the Trukk Boyz. My favorite niece does and growls ""WAAAGHHHHH"" but her sister plays Minecraft.  My friends who are parents, even if they were or are gamers and nerds, are confused about what content is safe for their kids these days. When Among Us came out my sister asked if it was safe for kids.. and I didn't know to be honest. We grew up on Gamestop.. why not have it shepherd the next generation of entertainment through diverse programming and informing parents. Subscribe to Gamespot basic for a newsletter about family friendly games and activities you can play with multiple generations, kids and parents, just kids, just parents, etc. Hype games like Jackbox, not just Cyberpunk.  You know what everyone pitches and hates pitching? Social media. Social media got too broad, it needs some structure, can we revisit a cross between GameSpy and ICQ that lets you instantly play games with friends, coworkers, family, your kids.. from anywhere? Maybe its an app, maybe its an API, maybe its tied to a platform like Apple messaging but maybe its a PWA and goes anywhere. You can game, but you can also reflect your life and experiences like Instagram (without the privacy/snooping/hate speech) so people can share and grow. Gamespot would regulate the shit out of content with super supportive moderation and a heavy fucking hand.  Similarly to Gamestop's business partner Microsoft's Xbox, they can help censor and report malicious or offensive content and hate speech in online experiences. That crap has no place. Instead of pitching mountain dew and doritos, jolt cola, top ramen like at LAN parties, sell some nutritious and not too-marked-up food staples because parents will just leave their kids there for a while.  While the parents are there, hook them into gaming with their kids, and being gaming mentors for their kids' friends and other folks. Gaming mentors can be a badge, old nerds love that shit, or offer discounts to game subscriptions and services. Mentor/GM/advise parents for X hours and get game exclusives. Teach them that grandma and grandpa like games, that we can all bond through entertainment.  Gamestop used to be the linchpin, similarly to GameSpy for finding friends playing games, or ICQ being the communicator, whatever. Game studios threw them away, but lost their ability to talk to their customers. Keep Gamestop retail stores as these mini arcades, basically a fun version of the Apple store, where yeah, you can buy a console and Nintendo minifigs or whatever.. but a kid can use their Gamestop save card and tap into their last progress with some puzzle fighter, or tap in to get an exclusive skin for Minecraft by solving some STEM puzzles, whatever. Don't like retail stores? Great! Get rid of them- we're in an age where you can host wide user research panels through Zoom, Teams, whatever.  Game studios and hardware/console makers can tap into their raw customer base here. Transparently advertise paid panel sessions where actual kids who play the game can just call Blizzard a bag of fucking dicks and Blizzard will pay to hear it. Good developers are desperate to hear feedback, good studios will flock to it, and Gamestop employees are brilliant, they can easily crosstrain as user research panelists/experts. Shit, introduce that into the transaction and sell game studios anonymized customer reports. At checkout or if customers ask about products and services, write it into the process of sales advisement (not pushing games though!) on collecting feedback and make SURE the customer understands their feedback to employees will be used to help shape games- but its anonymized, no user data collected.  With all this opportunity also comes trust... put trust #1. Microsoft with Satya was all like ""play well with others"" and ""truuuust bitches."" There's been gaps sure, but them and Apple under Cook are trying (and should) lock advertisers out of their ecosystems. Nobody should be reading your kids' gaming or reading habits, but the parents. Fuck Facebook, fuck Robinhood, etc.  Now this is a low effort elevator pitch but if $GME or any of their partners, potential partners, want to make a play, I'll sign up to write a pitch deck, a one pager, whatever. I'm an MBA in tech, former Gamestop customer, raised in computers.. but I'm also not a gamer. I mostly garden and do outdoor shit, but I still love some wholesome entertainment.

PS.. grow from within, Gamestop employees are, I'm sure, itching to get in on ground floor growth. Having a resource like that to tap for leadership opportunities is huge.  PPS.. Sherrilyn Ifill wrote a fucking beautiful report for Starbucks on how to engage communities after Starbucks shit the bed for the .. fourth time or whatever and fucking arrested their own customers for buying coffee while being Black. You want the literal business plan read ""[Toward a Vision for Racial Equity &amp; Inclusion at Starbucks: Review and Recommendations](https://www.demos.org/research/toward-vision-racial-equity-inclusion-starbucks-review-and-recommendations)"" and also buy her books, and watch every recorded lecture of hers you can find online, then contract her &amp; her network to tailor this FOR GAMESTOP. Gamestop was, and is about community- diverse and inclusive community, and racial equity &amp; inclusion should be #1. Growing up in Chicago dragging the few PC's we had to empty corner offices all over the north and south side to hook up and play Command and Conquer, AOE, whatever, that is some shit for everybody.

No! Don‚Äôt do it. You need to switch to an established broker that has in-house clearing.

If it says Self clearing: No - stay the hell away.   *I know Rh is now self-clearing, but that literally happened Friday morning and they do not have anywhere close to the required liquidity to handle the current volumes - so stay the hell away.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are GME or AMC gang or if you don‚Äôt plan on owning any of the meme stocks. Liquidity issues will effect other stocks too. Robinhood had to limit stocks like AMD, GM and even Starbucks. They can not keep up. Most of those other brokers also use the same clearing house - Apex Clearing. That‚Äôs a lot of volume to handle. They will be the weak link in the chain that causes the whole system to fail. They already did on Thursday. All the sketchy  shit pulled by various brokers was a direct result of Apex‚Äôs inability to keep up with demand.   TLDR - find your broker on [this list](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/) and if they say ‚Äúself clearing -no‚Äù then you really should switch to a broker that is self-clearing  This is is not financial advice, just my opinion.

The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their deiminated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.  * During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthen demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.  * GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.  * Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions  from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""  * RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from his updates since 2019...)  * If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.  * Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.  * After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.  * In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?  * Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.  * **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).  * **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET.   * The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

GM, Square &amp; Uber rise while the stock market is still focused on the big short squeeze. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market having a bounce back day after the Wednesday sell-off, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/B6BpyXY) gaining 300 points, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/NpK8M1k) rising by almost 1% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QmbLhTF) adding 0.50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n05j6wj) plunged almost 20%, but remains at very high levels above 30‚Ä¶ so, really anything can still happen right now with such high volatility in the markets  We saw almost 60% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/mCmXv61) on average volume, with the number of companies above the 50-day moving average remaining pretty much the same as all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/r0jQrf5) finished in the green with Financials, Materials &amp; Industrials leading the way as Large-Cap Value plays [were](https://ibb.co/Zxc7tc4) mostly the flavor of the day, while small-caps lagged behind.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PQZxbwB) from yesterday, where we can see a big wall of green with a few exception in the big names that reported earnings the night before, with Apple which reported all-time record revenues and crushed estimates, Facebook that also delivered a solid beat and announced future buybacks &amp; Tesla which did miss on earnings but delivered another solid revenue growth for the quarter, losing more than 2.5% for the day, while Microsoft continued to march forward after a spectacular quarter alongside most of the other big companies.  We have seen a big shift in [stock](https://ibb.co/qRxktps) performance after earnings results, with most companies overdelivering in EPS &amp; revenues, but underperforming significantly afterwards, with the avg 1-day performance being almost a negative 2%, as we haven‚Äôt seen a negative 1-day performance since the end of the dot com bubble. I think the one big difference now is that most stocks have actually delivered great earnings and are profitable, but they are suffering from big run-ups from pre-earnings trading in a buy the news &amp; sell the event set-up. So, I believe now is not the time to chase earnings reports, stay invested for the long-term and you will benefit from great companies.  In terms of economic data, we saw the 4th quarter [GDP](https://ibb.co/86mVKsN) coming in at a 4% annualized growth, slightly lower than the 4.1% expected, as the economic recovery is still ongoing, but the rate of growth has significantly slowed down from the 33.40% we saw in the 3rd quarter.  We also saw jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/4Z8VBVj) yesterday coming in a little better than expected, dropping to 847K as the continuing jobless claims also dropped to 4.77M while the Kansas [FED](https://ibb.co/sQwLJNV) and the [retail](https://ibb.co/6JDDPw8) inventories came in better than the previous month.  On the other hand, we saw the new home [sales](https://ibb.co/0nMhSSz) rising by only 1.6%, less than expected but are still up over 15% year/year, while [wholesale](https://ibb.co/2kYz2WH) oinventories rose less than expected and the December leading [indicators](https://ibb.co/B2YRRZS) came in-line with the expectations.    In some other stock market news, we saw [Square](https://ibb.co/BtrN0QH) jumping more than 8% as Retail Investors turned to their Cash app to trade stocks that have been blocked by numerous trading platforms. I think Square has become a very good play on both the digital currencies &amp; stock trading, though they still have a lot of work to do to grow into their valuation.  We also saw [UBER](https://ibb.co/vPHDw3p) jumping more than 7% after Morgan Stanley pitched the company based on better-than-expected EBITDA for 2021, future disclosures on Uber Eats and the company being a very good re-opening play as their customers seem to have a healthy balance sheet that will allow them to spend a lot of money once the world re-opens. I also like &amp; own Uber as a good re-opening play, while Uber Eats also makes them a good stay-at-home stock, so a win-win.  Meanwhile, [GM](https://ibb.co/CMqQF70) announced they are planning to be carbon neutral by 2040 as they are planning to go all-electric by 2035 while planning to use 100% renewable energy to power their facilities by 2030 in the US. GM seems to be a very good play on the EV market, not only Tesla &amp; NIO, as they are also planning to bring to the market their Ultium platform by 2025, and I believe with their Cruise venture, [GM](https://ibb.co/k3TpZ56) has a lot of room to run up in the next years.  So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US Futures are pointing to a red open with the Nasdaq futures down more than 1.6% and are set for the worst performance since late [October](https://ibb.co/L8hQHH0) as we [await](https://ibb.co/rMmF3RL) to get the Consumer Sentiment Index, a couple of other economic numbers &amp; some FED speakers later in the day while the world is still on pause watching the short squeezed stocks developments with some of the trading [platforms](https://ibb.co/BT7V52k) planning to resume buying capacity on the stocks that have been the headlines of the year until now.   **Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

You may have noticed a few things happening in stocks the past little while such as EV plays being popular, wsb realizing its potential power as a meme stock pumper, and, most recently, triggering short squeezes on heavily shorted stocks. If you haven't noticed any of that, don't worry, you still belong here and we accept you.¬†  ¬†  Now I want to say one thing before we get into this - **DON'T SELL GME!**¬†  ¬†  This is not some play to distract from the big kahuna. It's a potential next move and we should have a little time. So let me repeat, do not fucking sell.¬†  ¬†  Let's go ahead and get the main idea out of the way...¬†     **TLCR;** XL Fleet is one of the many Electric Vehicle plays on the market right now. It has the potential to be an incredible value play going forward, but more importantly, it's looking like a short term play given its shares floating and its short float. Buy calls, buy shares, just buy it. Obligatory - üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ        **The Company**¬†  Xl Fleet was founded in 2009 by an MIT grad by the name of Tod Hynes under the name XL Hybrids, the name denoting the core focus of the company in its infancy - hybrids, baby. They actually upgrade your gas powered vehicle to one of two hybrid configurations. They aren't as sexy as EV's with their cutting edge marketing and cool, you're in the future vibes, but they save money that companies would spend on fuel and they cut CO2 emissions. They do this through three existing services:¬†  	* XL Hybrid - 25% MPG improvement, 20% CO^2 reduction 	* XL Plug In - up to 50% MPG improvement, 33% CO^2 reduction¬†  	* XL Link - basically just software to monitor your upgraded hybrid fleet to save more money and stuff These are the three systems that they have installed so far, but they have two others they are racing to deploy:¬†  	* XL Electric - Full on BEV's, none of that hybrid shit, not available yet but companies that are happy with XL Fleet will start buying these guys down the road.¬†  	* XL Grid - Handles the charging and storage for your fleet of environmentally friendly vehicles¬†  ¬†  The XL Hybrid one is pretty straightforward. They use regenerative braking to provide electricity the car can use when accelerating afterwards. Over time this saves fuel. The Plug in option is a lot more EV style. Basically, they have a bigger battery that they charge up at a station, and that handles the power needs for the vehicle until it can't, at which point the regular engine kicks in.¬†  Their goal is pretty straightforward - to provide simple, sustainable fleet electrification solutions to the commercial fleet market. This term ""electrification"" comes up a lot with them, it's just their half step towards fully electric vehicles that might be too expensive at present. Just how big is this market? XL Fleet's investor presentation cites their total addressable market as being over 1 Trillion. Now I can't count that high but my understanding is that it's quite a large number.¬†   ¬†  **The Leadership** Tod Hynes - Founder and President - literally teaches a class called Energy Ventures at MIT in his spare time.¬†  Dimitri Kazarinoff - CEO - scaled hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x in two years. This matters a smidge because of that 1 trillion number and the fact that, while XL fleet is leading the electrification market,there is enormous potential for growth.¬†  Colleen Calhoun - just brought her in a month or two ago - former VP and General Manager of the¬† XL Grid Division at General Electric and worked with them on Global Growth Markets.¬†  Deb Frodl - Previously served as Global Executive Director for Ecomagination at General Electric. I don't even know what that word means but it sounds smart as fuck.¬†  Niharika Ramdev - worked in supply chain finance for General Motors.¬†  Sara Sclarsic - made a biotech company on her own, works with climate change stuff, and is pretty hot.¬†  ¬†  **Why XL Fleet?**   Transporation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US and fleet managers are under increased pressure to curb emissions. Some of you may have noticed the United States had an election recently, and the new guy wants us to save the planet and have non binary drum circles. Now you can feel how you want about that, but the bottom line is that if we don't have a biosphere conducive to the existence of the human species, then civilization collapses, and that means there is no more stock market. Pretty lame.¬†  ¬†  If you really don't give a shit about climate stuff, then just focus on the fact that XL Fleet saves companies money. One Coca Cola fleet manager said, ""There are fuel savings and potential maintenance savings. The XLH powertrain unit pays for itself three times over its lifespan due to these savings."" Well that's notable. That's the little guy, too. Just the XL Hybrid, not even the plug in version. XL Fleet is working with tons of big names like Coke, Pepsi, FedEx,Harvard?, Seattle firefighters, etc. They specialize in Class 2-6 commercial vehicles but are expanding into the large class 7 and 8 ones. That means they electrify utility vans, pickup trucks, box trucks, school buses, mini buses, delivery vehicles, step vans, bucket trucks and are going to eventually upgrade transit buses, tow trucks, refuse trucks, and semi tractors. Now I only know what about a quarter of those are without pictures, but you get what I'm saying. If it's a boring, task oriented vehicle you see a hundred times a month, then its probably something XL Fleet is trying to ""electrify.""¬†  ¬†  If the government makes a hard pivot to BEVs then XL Fleet may miss that market, but the big companies will still want to use them. Coke, Pepsi, and others have millions of vehicles. And no EV overhaul can happen overnight. By the time its in full swing, XL Electric will be up and running, bringing on new customers and converting existing customers.¬†     One last thing, they already have deals with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Ford, Chevrolet, and Isuzu to make it easy to install their productst. I believe the financial types call that a moat. I'm a bit of a simpleton and just consider it another reason this rocket ship is heading for the heliopause.  ¬†  **Slightly Financial Stuff**   XL already sells stuff. Oh yeah, you read that right. In this speculative EV landscape where people throw money at you for talking about skateboards and shit, XL has customers and real life products. Don't get me wrong, I think Canoo and Arrival sound cool, but they aren't going to be pumping out millions of vehicles any time soon. XL has plans to scale up exponentially by 2024.¬†  ¬†  Estimated revenue in 2021 is 75 million with 17 million in profits. Fast forward to 2024 and estimated revenue is 1.3 billion with 340 million in profit. Those estimates are on 6% North American Market penetration. That's ignoring their efforts at expanding overseas and their potential to outdo that 6% estimate.¬†   ¬†  Let's look at valuation, specifically estimated Enterprise value/revenue for 2023. Their investor presentation states their EV/Rev will be 1.5. For comparison, Tesla will be 6.4 and Workhorse will be 5.5. The numbers for 2024 look even better. Now I would have made a chart or attached a link but I'm tired and don't want to figure that shit out.¬†  ¬†  The bottom line is they have a product, a plan, and a good foothold in a massive addressable market.¬†  ¬†  **....Oh yea, the motherfucking short squeeze**   Almost forgot. So XL has a float of about 8 million shares. 71% of those are shorted. 8 million is a comically low number. Now, their shares outstanding is about 140 million or so, but those are locked up till roughly mid summer. If I've misunderstood that please correct me, but it looks like we've got some time to throw money at it, so do your GME thing and put some profits in XL Fleet.  ¬†  Positions: 735 shares at 20.46. Cramer said don't buy it in the 20's and I say fuck Cramer. Also I don't know enough about the specifics of option pricing to really tell you if there are good deals to be had there, but the latest dated ones are August so I dunno.¬†  ¬†  If you've made it this far, I question how you spend your time.¬†  ¬†  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, I have no clue what I'm talking about, I JUST LIKE THE STOCK!"|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|4607994|public|confidence|self|||A Look at XL Fleet|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ypdq/a_look_at_xl_fleet/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-01-28|GM

In a nutshell if GM does good job (and its team seems to be doing great) essentially it can become a major player in pushing forward the EV revolution ( 30 models by 2025 by their words). They've also teamed with Honda (and few other famous companies lately), which by my standards it probably the most reliable cars on the market.

So far, the following have worked out quite well (in order):  1. AMC  - Bought at around $5 (currently at around 17) 2. NOK - Also bought at around $5 (currently at around 7.5) 3. HIBB - Bought at 53 (currently at around 55.5) 4. BB - Bought at \~20 (Currently at 27) 5. NAKD: Bought at \~0.6 (currently at around 0.9) 6. EXPR: Bought at \~6 (currently at 10)  **Just bought 5000 SNDL stocks at 60 cents,** just based on a random unverified tweet that said it's among the top traded stocks today. Cheap stock, given the past trends, I don't think there's too much downside. Who knows if it gets pulled into the current trend and goes to double digits. Every dollar gained will mean $5K profit (I am not a seasoned investor, so just random logics)  Other longer term bets: Twtr, GM, Uber (currently losing), Salesforce (bought at 220), CPLP, Zoom, SCU  I do believe Nokia and BB can bounce back as businesses too, the rest I've invested mostly based on the chatter. AMC turned out to be a good decision. High hopes on NAKD and EXPR because I've bought a decent amount (by my own standards).

This is for all the people who just joined this group. I'm sure you all heard it in the news and you're curious about what is happening.  The following is copied from one of the Discord servers I'm in:      &gt;   **GME or GameStop has been making the headlines lately with Jim Cramer calling it a short buster  move. What is the cause of the rapid gain in price** in a company that seems all but doomed to failure with store closures left and right and heavy laden with debt? Often times such things don‚Äôt come to light until after the fact, but here are some **possible factors:**   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;**1) FOMO** \- Reddit has been abuzz with this ticker for quite some time now. Let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs lots of members and lots of money on there. This initial move catches the eyes of folks such as myself and we start piling in on the trade.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;2) **Change of board members** \- Cohen of CHWY fame is now on board and owns a 13% stake in GME and a success story of an internet retail company vs a field dominated by AMZN    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;**3) Increased holiday sales** \- GameStop reported a nice surprise in the last earnings due to increased sales from the new console releases. As it happens every time a new generation of consoles comes out, GME makes a very strong spike upward.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;**4) Infinity Squeeze** \- all the above factors have increased interest in GME. And the final ingredient is what is called the infinity squeeze. With this we have a short squeeze where short sellers of a stock are forced to buy back a stock at higher prices as the prices soar. This is a positive feedback loop and is made possible when a stock is excessively shorted. GME had a 140% short interest. Why is it over 100%? That is because the float of the stock is less than the total shares (not all share available to be traded).    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;In 2008, VW in what is now known as the mother of all squeezes went to $1000. Hence the outlandish GME PTs you see floating around. However, the situation with GM is similar but different. The float is not nearly as small as VW back then.   You can read more about infinity squeeze from the VW 2008 infinity squeeze example - **highly recommended educational read as it shows why the ‚Äúbest shorts‚Äù are sometimes the most dangerous:**  [https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)     &amp;#x200B;  Here are two videos that were really helpful to me to understand how important it is to join this movement:     [The Massive GameStop Short Squeeze, Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErvqnEFb-E&amp;ab_channel=DanielInskeep&amp;fbclid=IwAR1suEjEsr6fsLREl2ZFvmi-wrE9eUmpIjF0exRhX9dxmw0-9P-7txHAnNc)  [GME Short Squeeze, Battle Of The Billionaires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9MwTSNnj4E&amp;t=380s&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetMillennial&amp;fbclid=IwAR1zlSkAZAhcTqO2MB80JzwAjeFNL62piBdzdLzCx3jThaUwV5oDNLw_08M)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2883869|public|confidence|self|||What is GME and what's up with all the news around it?|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l669vc/what_is_gme_and_whats_up_with_all_the_news_around/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'kF9SFK3tzP8ayd1wiijUpBBgh4GZw6HT8t3NL1_rV6c', 'resolutions': [{'height': 77, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/rKOXqIdLNqXQjNbHUUz27o-l79SA0XCO2UCkyOq5VB4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c39dedc4c0ecf764f8fcdd0e2087282ab3ad9c24', 'width': 108}, {'height': 154, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/rKOXqIdLNqXQjNbHUUz27o-l79SA0XCO2UCkyOq5VB4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a89fdef4dd699ef7773d276c7bec93fb291eba44', 'width': 216}, {'height': 229, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/rKOXqIdLNqXQjNbHUUz27o-l79SA0XCO2UCkyOq5VB4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afb8e47c7cbfac692d2ff351e81a37e7e9282428', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 324, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/rKOXqIdLNqXQjNbHUUz27o-l79SA0XCO2UCkyOq5VB4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7ad7d13539f1389cb3b83b6a08e061d03a406c6b', 'width': 452}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-01-27|GM

The merger solidifies STLA as the 4th biggest automaker by volume on the planet. Their market cap is far below is far that ($49B - 11th highest MC). 2. They were going through the merger process when F and GM were riding the EV boom wave last week, yet STLA may be best positioned of the 3 in the EV market. 3. FCA obviously has a strong US customer base. PSA not only allows them better positioning in Europe, but also gives them a leg up in the EV race. 4. They currently have 29 EVs on the market and plan to have 39 by the end of 2021.  5. They offer a range of bands that reach different price points, from Dodge to Maserati. They will look to implement EV tech across all price points.  6. STLA CEO Carlos Tavares believes that the merger will result in $6.1B in savings that will be 80% realized before 2025.  This is an EV play but it‚Äôs not talked about like the others!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  Let me know what you all think.

It depends on the lowest bid usually, but GM did takeover for a bit. I think with GM and Tesla already being big dogs in the EV field that when that government contracts calls they‚Äôre going to do what government does best... buy the cheapest option, not the best option.   I work for the state and all of our vehicles in the entire state are Ford. Now go out and look around at the cops that pass you, most are Fords. If local and state government decided to go to EV they will most likely stick with what they know and what is cheapest.. Ford.

Apple is rumored to be expanding its office in Canada, their current office is right fucking next door to Blackberry/QNX.  Apple has already siphoned of some of the QNX staff, but not all, and not the source code.  Apple needs QNX software for their EV.  Blackberry has 38,000 patents, with 10,000 of those with the word ‚Äòvehicle‚Äô in the patent.  Apple can use these patents. Apple needs these patents to get into a new car market. They are going to get their ass sued off when they start selling cars.  Tesla could also use these patents. Uber, Ford, GM, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, could use these patents. And the QNX software and software team.  Apple is (my guess only) making a bid for Blackberry to scoop up the rest of the QNX team, the source code and the patents. Tesla may be making a counterbid. Other players might be involved. Elon uses the QNX code already in his spacecars.

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook &amp; Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM &amp; Ford spiked last week, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% &amp; the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.  About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%  For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.  Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies &amp; Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.  Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil &amp; Gas companies were the biggest losers  We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points  This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel‚Äôs drop last week, Microsoft &amp; Starbucks reporting after Tuesday‚Äôs close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&amp;T &amp; Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday &amp; Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla &amp; Facebook reporting after Wednesday‚Äôs close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.  In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday &amp; Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low &amp; the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.  In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It‚Äôs expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.  We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I‚Äôve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla‚Äôs models. It‚Äôs the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way‚Ä¶ [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV &amp; self-driving sector.  Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB &amp; the shorts continues, with this move making Citron‚Äôs Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.  So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons &amp; especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don‚Äôt think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn‚Äôt exclude the possibility of the pullback‚Ä¶ keep investing safely &amp; have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.  So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%  **Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

The report estimates the potential revenues when the cars are connected online. They said that the overall revenue pool from car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 - 750 billion by 2030.  Here is a breakdown of the possible revenue streams as per the report:  In-Car Sources of income (QNX Income):  1. OEMs selling the service to customers and advertisers paying for the data are among the business models that might contribute to the value of the data-enabled social driving experience, which is expected to have an estimated value of USD 7 - 8 billion by 2030. 2. High-tech giants are positioned to provide the fundamental car data analytics services that car OEMs and advertisers are willing to buy. In addition to being the IT backbone, they can offer front-end applications. 3. Start-ups are the smaller counterparts of the high-tech giants, entering the car data monetization space from a variety of angles, such as developing new apps, engineering innovative hardware/interfaces (e.g., retro-fittable gesture-activated controls) 4. Retailers and service centers are using car data analytics to optimize their sales network and get the messages about their offerings directly to drivers 5. Automotive OEMs. In addition to selling connectivity-related options and services (e.g., infotainment, navigation), OEMs are already becoming active in-car data analytics to better understand how customers use their cars, shape their repair and maintenance choices, and improve the link between dealers and customers (e.g., allowing for real-time, remote booking of vehicle check-ups). 6. Insurers are able to capitalize on car data by offering usage-based insurance contracts, exploring occasion-related policies  Big data and Cloud Sources of Income (IVY Income):  1. Service providers offer data management services 2. Regulators/government institutions are setting the standards regarding the collection and sharing of car data. 3. Automotive suppliers are developing the software and hardware that are forming the infrastructure capable of capturing, analyzing, and selling car data 4. Roadside assistance providers can collect and process distress calls in real-time from vehicle sensors and automated alerts 5. Infrastructure operators, including billing/toll road operators and recharging/refueling players, are analyzing car data to optimize the geographic deployment of their respective services  Customer willingness to pay for features ‚Äì as opposed to a preference for free, ad-supported features ‚Äì varies across use cases and geographies. To make it easier for us to have an early estimate of QNX potential revenues, we need to know their market share geographically too.  Germany (As per 2020 Sales):  QNX Clients: VW + Mercedes + BMW + Audi + Ford + Toyota + Kia= more than 62% of the Auto Market  China (As per 2019 Car sales):  QNX Clients: VW+ Honda + Hyundai + Mercedes + BMW +Kia= 42.7%  USA:  QNX Clients: More than 70%  \*\*New EV Clients of QNX are not included and not projected in any figures  \*\*GM and Porsche signed deals with Android Auto and Apple to be the operating systems of the car despite these cars running with QNX system. We can exclude them as QNX clients for now.  **Back to customer willingness to pay per product/service:**  **1.Predictive maintenance services:**  Germany: 73%  USA: 73%  China: 78%  QNX Market share: 45% of Germany Revenues +  53% of US revenues+32% of China revenues  **2.

If we take a look at Goldman Sachs report about expected car sales by 2025  Emerging Markets: 78 Million cars  Developed Countries: 34 Million cars  If we assume that by 2025 every car powered by QNX would have the new QNX system ( They said the first one will launch in 2023) and if we apply the QNX market share above.  **QNX would power:**  32 Million cars in emerging markets  22 Million cars in developed markets  If QNX offered a bundle of $15/month (and $10 in emerging markets) tailored package for parking assistance and maintenance and other services in developed countries. and If we apply the willingness to pay numbers from the Mckinsey report  **QNX Potential Revenue from basic features package:**  Developed Countries: 22M \* 71% \* 15 \* 12 = $ 2.8Bn  Emerging Countries: 32M \* 78% \* 10\* 12= $ 2.9Bn  If you add up an estimate for the rest of the products it might provide and potential contracts it can have for IVY with several governments, It would be easy for Balckberry to reach 8-10 Bn in Sales by 2025.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|2076595|public|confidence|self|||BB - Expected Revenue - Monetizing Car Data|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4c6l4/bb_expected_revenue_monetizing_car_data/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-01-25|GM

I'll be including hyperlinked sources for all stats and claims I make.   # First off, reasons I like BB   A lot of this has been overdone in this subreddit, but in summary:  * Approaching $1B software and licensing revenue on $7.85B market cap (very reasonable price to sales for SAAS) * CEO John Chen has a technical background (BS in Electrical Engineering from Brown, MS in EE from Caltech) [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Chen) * This is super important for tech companies because a technical CEO will actually understand their product and not just be a bean counter (case study: Bob Swan and Intel) * CEO John Chen made the bold move of pivoting from a doomed hardware business to software and has stuck at it for the last 7 years (he's not going anywhere until he accomplishes his mission) * Recent Sony/AWS/etc. partnerships * They are the incumbent in auto OS with Blackberry QNX running on 175 million cars right now [PR Newswire source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html) * 5 years ago, they were at 60 million, so that's a CAGR of 23.8% per year (though that's starting to slow - 2019 to 2020 was 150M --&gt; 175M so 16.7% as they reach saturation I imagine + COVID) * Diversified revenue streams (licensing, patents, QNX, Spark, etc.) * IEC safety certs + possibility of integrating with their own security products ([https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)) (I haven't found anything similar for Android Automotive yet, let me know if there is)  # What is Android Automotive? (hint: not the same as Android Auto)  * First off, Google made this very confusing by having two different things called ""Android Automotive"" (the OS) and ""Android Auto"" (the app) * [Here's what they say](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive):  &gt;**Android Automotive is Android**. Android Automotive is not a fork or parallel development of Android. It is the same codebase and lives in the same repository as the Android shipped on phones, tablets, etc. It builds on a robust platform and feature set developed over 10+ years, enabling it to leverage the existing security model, compatibility program, developer tools, and infrastructure while continuing to be highly customizable and portable, completely free, and open source   &gt;   &gt;**Android Automotive extends Android**. In the course of building Android into a full-featured platform for infotainment, we‚Äôre adding support for automotive-specific requirements, features, and technologies. Android Automotive will be a full-stack, turnkey automotive infotainment platform, just as Android is for mobile today.  ""Android Automotive is Android"". That's a big thing. That means:  * Android Automotive is backed by Google and Google's Android teams * Android Automotive is backed by the Android open source community  * Android Automotive can integrate closer with Google Play Store, Google Maps, and Google Assistant (literal quote from Nissan's press release [here](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4-180918-01-e) which I cover later) * Any Android developers should theoretically be able to write an app for Android Automotive without too much retraining * We're talking about software here, so ultimately it's up to engineers and developers to actually use it * In the past, software deals were signed by taking CTOs and account executives to steakhouses and golfing excursions.  * These days, engineers are a lot more involved - oftentimes spinning up prototypes to demo for their leadership before any deals are signed. (Or if they aren't, that's a huge red flag for any company that relies on tech.)  # Developer friendliness case study: documentation  This sounds dumb, but let's look at what documentation engineers would have to work with:  Virgin Blackberry QNX docs: [http://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29183](http://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29183)  * Folder icons and entire page literally look out of Windows XP * You have to download PDFs (what are you going to do, print them all out and arrange them in your cubicle?)  Chad Android Automotive docs: [https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/evs/camera\_system](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/evs/camera_system)  * Super clean, super easy to read, all in the browser, well organized  Compare these to successful API-based SAAS services like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) or [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api). If you were a developer and learning auto OS for the first time, what would you rather use?  Obviously, no company is going to pick an operating system based on their documentation alone, but I think it reveals a lot about the development ecosystem that their engineers will have to operate in. And ever more these days, engineers are empowered to guide their leadership in what software they want to use (e.g. engineers would rather use easy-to-use MongoDB than stuffy old Oracle).  # Market Share  * As mentioned at the beginning, Blackberry QNX is killing it with 175M cars on the road * That's the main reason why I like it in the short term - huge amounts of recurring SAAS revenue  I'm worried that in 5-10 years, Apple and Google are going to come in and eat Blackberry's lunch just like they did with mobile:  * GM will use Android Automotive in all their cars starting in 2021 [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment)  &gt;General Motors will use Google‚Äôs new Android Automotive OS to power the infotainment systems in its cars starting in 2021, the two companies announced on Thursday. That means **Google Assistant, Maps, and other automotive-approved Android apps** will be available in GM‚Äôs cars via the Play Store without requiring the use of an Android smartphone.  * Nissan, Renault, and Mitsubishi are using Android Automotive [Nissan press release](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4-180918-01-e)  &gt;World's leading automotive alliance signs a global multiyear agreement to partner with Google to equip Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles with intelligent infotainment systems   &gt;   &gt;The Alliance will utilize Android, world's most popular operating system, to offer customers a new array of services including **Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play Store**   &gt;   &gt;These services will be combined with Alliance Intelligent ""Cloud based"" remote software upgrades and vehicle diagnostics  * Porche's new all electric Taycan will be using Apple Car Play for all the cool software stuff (infotainment, music, etc.) while maintaining Blackberry QNX for the car critical functions [source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-big-tech-companies-may-soon-edge-out-automakers-with-advanced/) * While BB still gets their share, if the Apple/Intel developments are any indication, Apple will use 3rd parties to get going but their obsession with seamless hardware/software in their products makes me wonder how long it'll take before Apple does their own car OS  # Summary  * Big picture, the auto OS market is huge, ""expected to hit $4.5B by 2026"" so there's plenty of money to go around. It's possible Blackberry QNX, Android Automotive, and other OS may all flourish together. [global news wire source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html) * That said, I find it very worrying that companies like GM, Nissan, Porsche are deciding to partner with the Google and Apple for their new models (obviously, they have no incentive to retrofit old/existing cars with new OS) * Short term BB's biggest moat comes from their incumbent market share + security guarantees (ie as a customer you'd get IEC certs for free by using BB QNX). I think their next few years will remain cushy. * Long term, I don't see any guarantee that auto manufacturers (especially start-ups composed of SV engineers) wouldn't go with open source Android Automotive over closed source Windows XP docs BB QNX that reeks of like IBM/Oracle/HP type boomer software. * BB does have diversified revenue with their security offerings, so though QNX is a large portion of their revenue, it's not all.  As mentioned earlier, I do have shares of BB (as well as GOOGL) and think BB will have a jolly good time in the next 3-5 years. But I do worry that Google and Apple will come in and repeat what they did to Blackberry with mobile.

This past Tuesday, I was thinking of buying a call option. I looked at the previous days  cAll option prices, and they were around 300-400$ for in the money around 30$ Share price. When my brokerage refreshed , the price went up to around 600 for a call option for GME. The price jump discouraged me from buying so instead I bought a call option of GM for 185, price went down a lil, got scared, sold the option for 145. 80CAD lost Cus of conversion rate. Got mad, took money out of brokerage. Saw how well GME was doing, put money back in brokerage on Thursday. It didn‚Äôt get into my account today on Friday (or sat morning, still awake) , and I missed it..... so hopefully the money will be in brokerage , but also hopefully the call prices don‚Äôt go up to like 1500 per contract   Let‚Äôs go to the moon üöÄ|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1990213|public|confidence|self|||Opportunity Cost, To The Extreme - GME|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l374s5/opportunity_cost_to_the_extreme_gme/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-01-23|GM

In any event when our EIA was green lit in 2020 in February, the pandemic hit. And stalled and gave a massive pause to the entire mining industry. We now move fastforward to today. With a Green Energy Proponent sitting in the most powerful executive office seat of any nation, Biden, committing to the Clean Energy Race along with China, any Lithium and clean energy play will do very well. Even Hydrogen power depends on Lithium to store the electricity. See Mirai from Toyota. In any event, Lithium Power along with Bearing Lithium OWN tenements and have mining rights to a section in this highly concentrated Lithium region. And like SQM and Albermarle, we are relatively close to coastal waters for transport. Lithium Power and Bearing Lithium are sitting on pureGold at the moment. Millions of Tons of it. And as a stock holder of BLILF and LTHHF, it's my belief you too will be able to claim through stock ownership of this very coveted mineral needed for electric batteries, mostly for EV's which every legacy car maker is vowing, to turn fully EV, lately very vocally GM. Ford and for some time now, Volkswagon. All major worldwide car manufacturers are pivoting towards the EV paradigm shift. Tesla only makes about 500,000 cars per year, barely. Ford in 2019 built and sold 5.4 million. And Ford is backing Rivian. And all legacy brands like the Mustang and the F150 are all going EV. Not to mention China and other clean energy movements.

People in wall street are going crazy because these two stocks are years behind in EV's, the Microsoft deal is somewhat good news but using AI for cars takes experience and lots of data. I'm big on EV stocks and growth stocks, it doesn't take that much to impress me as long as there's potential and see proof.  GM and Ford are making EVs that have expensive old inefficient batteries and no software to make the motors independent to make them more efficient, they have no charging infrastructure and terrible milage. I'm more likely to put my money in $GOEV, $NIO, and Lucid motors when they're public. Startups have to innovate to stay alive, big carmakers have to put out a joke car so their investors think they will do something. Tesla has shown their innovators even while having the largest market cap and only delivering 500k cars a year. Telsa has the leg up in every sector but manufacturing power, which will change very soon. They have better software, better Machine learning, they have more EVs on the road giving their AI more data which makes it way better, their car efficiency is much better and they know how to make an EV  (now). They have better design and engineering, Ford and GM have a few cars combined Tesla has 4 out right now and 3 more on the way.  Ford and Gm even show that they are dependent on startups, remember GM and $NKLA instead of developing their own cars because they're too lazy they try buying a truck company that was public for a few months and no real working trucks.  Rivian and Ford not much more to say. Rivian is good but under funding from a joke car company, they will buy Rivian cut corners to make an easy cheap car. Ford and Gm arent innovators, you want a big car company that is somewhat serious good luck their plan is to buy a start-up.  Everyone wants TSLA to go to them, china loves tesla and they usually hate American companies that should prove how much countries want EV makers. The whole point is GM and F are jokes they got so used to making the same car and not needing anything they forgot how to innovate and bring change. VW their liars they can't even make a good ICE car how do you expect them to make a clean energy car without making an ICE emission problem almost no other carmakers have. You may see I'm a hardcore Tesla bull. You want 3 real cars $NIO and $TSLA and Lucid motors. You don't like Evs then GME and PLTR.  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1948489|public|confidence|self|||$GM &amp; $F are jokes.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2u2mf/gm_f_are_jokes/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-01-22|GM

I dont hold any GME, I plan on taking out call options in the morning 10 min after bell ring (29 Jan 21 weeklys). I have been doing this for a while for funds and clients and wanted to share why what's about to happen is important and why you should be paying attention. I have put all citations for this claim below.  The largest short squeeze ever in trading history occurred in 2008 to Volkswagen. For months previously hedge funds were bearish due to VW being an 'independent company' and being unable to leverage proper supply lines that other manufacturers were doing. We were in the middle of a recession and only the big car guys F, GM, etc were going to make it. As such hedge funds took out massive shorts and the company was shorted up to around 76% at its peak. This entire time Porsche was slowly acquiring a larger percentage ownership to eventually acquire VW under its title. When the news became public the shares skyrocketed and the funds scrambled to cover their losses resulting in the stock having a run up of 95% in less then a week.  Here is where GME comes in.  Volkswagen's float is around 280 million. Which means their are 280 million shares on the market to play with (either long or short). At its peak VW's percentage of shares shorted vs float was 76% (212m). To give you an idea floats over 100m dont really move that much, its only when ""big"" money (funds) get involved that these companies will move.  So...GME's float is around 50 million and its shares vs float is 100%.....think about that.  GME is an awful company. The 10-q and 10-k's show this. None of that matters however because whats going to happen tomorrow is a massive explosion. The world of Hedge Funds are dying, they cant charge 2&amp;20 anymore due to etf's and mutal's boxing them out. The short interest is going to ruin their return and they are going to be faced with a choice, either cover for a loss and try to sandbag the rest of the year to appease the clients or hold and pray that GME will come down in time. Both are risky and the entire time they are debating this the stock has gone up and they have lost money.  As other redditors have pointed out the shorts have not started covering yet. As we speak their is 47 million shares still shorted. Citron coming out to openly attempt to influence the share price is a last ditch effort to prevent literal apocalypse for these funds, its borderline illegal and Citron knows this. The reasoning behind this only further demonstrates how this massive explosion is about to happen. Nobody can stop you guys....not Cramer, not Citron, and not even the SEC. You caught the hedge funds with their pants down and now your going to milk the fuck out of their mistake for running naked shorts.  So why should you care? Well besides the money if you take a position or even just watch the chaos unfold you will see what could be the largest short squeeze since the advent of internet fueled trading. I am taking a position tomorrow simply because there is a good chance that by holding any position you could see a massive ROI.  So this is whats going to happen If GME opens below $50 and pushes up to $52 then the volume will start to increase rapidly. You will see this is your time and sales tab on a Bloomberg or thinkorswim terminal. Watch the 1m daily chart and its very possible that by 1pm the stock will pass $63 if that happens then its everyman for themselves and we could end the day in the early $80's or even higher.

With a Green Energy Proponent sitting in the most powerful executive office seat of any nation, Biden, committing to the Clean Energy Race along with China, any Lithium and clean energy play will do very well. Even Hydrogen power depends on Lithium to store the electricity. See Mirai from Toyota. In any event, Lithium Power along with Bearing Lithium OWN tenements and have mining rights to a section in this highly concentrated Lithium region. And like SQM and Albermarle, we are relatively close to coastal waters for transport. Lithium Power and Bearing Lithium are sitting on pureGold at the moment. Millions of Tons of it. And as a stock holder of BLILF and LTHHF, it's my belief you too will be able to claim through stock ownership of this very coveted mineral needed for electric batteries, mostly for EV's which every legacy car maker is vowing, to turn fully EV, lately very vocally GM. Ford and for some time now, Volkswagon. All major worldwide car manufacturers are pivoting towards the EV paradigm shift. Tesla only makes about 500,000 cars per year, barely. Ford in 2019 built and sold 5.4 million. And Ford is backing Rivian. And all legacy brands like the Mustang and the F150 are all going EV. Not to mention China and other clean energy movements. So these two stocks have been steadily climbing= BLILF &amp; LTHHF. The Bearing Lithium Canadian Equivalents to BLILF IS TICKER =BRZ and Australian Equivalent to LTHHF is LPI.

I dont hold any GME, I plan on taking out call options in the morning 10 min after bell ring (29 Jan 21 weeklys). I have been doing this for a while for funds and clients and wanted to share why what's about to happen is important and why you should be paying attention. I have put all citations for this claim below.   The largest short squeeze ever in trading history occurred in 2008 to Volkswagen. For months previously hedge funds were bearish due to VW being an 'independent company' and being unable to leverage proper supply lines that other manufacturers were doing. We were in the middle of a recession and only the big car guys F, GM, etc were going to make it. As such hedge funds took out massive shorts and the company was shorted up to around 76% at its peak. This entire time Porsche was slowly acquiring a larger percentage ownership to eventually acquire VW under its title. When the news became public the shares skyrocketed and the funds scrambled to cover their losses resulting in the stock having a run up of 95% in less then a week.  Here is where GME comes in.   Volkswagen's float is around 280 million. Which means their are 280 million shares on the market to play with (either long or short). At its peak VW's percentage of shares shorted vs float was 76% (212m). To give you an idea floats over 100m dont really move that much, its only when ""big"" money (funds) get involved that these companies will move.   So...GME's float is around 50 million and its shares vs float is 100%.....think about that.   &amp;#x200B;  GME is an awful company. The 10-q and 10-k's show this. None of that matters however because whats going to happen tomorrow is a massive explosion. The world of Hedge Funds are dying, they cant charge 2&amp;20 anymore due to etf's and mutal's boxing them out. The short interest is going to ruin their return and they are going to be faced with a choice, either cover for a loss and try to sandbag the rest of the year to appease the clients or hold and pray that GME will come down in time. Both are risky and the entire time they are debating this the stock has gone up and they have lost money.   As other redditors have pointed out the shorts have not started covering yet. As we speak their is 47 million shares still shorted. Citron coming out to openly attempt to influence the share price is a last ditch effort to prevent literal apocalypse for these funds, its borderline illegal and Citron knows this. The reasoning behind this only further demonstrates how this massive explosion is about to happen. Nobody can stop you guys....not Cramer, not Citron, and not even the SEC. You caught the hedge funds with their pants down and now your going to milk the fuck out of their mistake for running naked shorts.   &amp;#x200B;  So why should you care? Well besides the money if you take a position or even just watch the chaos unfold you will see what could be the largest short squeeze since the advent of internet fueled trading. I am taking a position tomorrow simply because there is a good chance that by holding any position you could see a massive ROI.   &amp;#x200B;  So this is whats going to happen If GME opens below $50 and pushes up to $52 then the volume will start to increase rapidly. You will see this is your time and sales tab on a Bloomberg or thinkorswim terminal. Watch the 1m daily chart and its very possible that by 1pm the stock will pass $63 if that happens then its everyman for themselves and we could end the day in the early $80's or even higher.   Best of luck to you guys,    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR: We could be witnessing a once in a lifetime short squeeze that will define WSB for the coming years.**   *Obligatory: This is not

We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers are saying it‚Äôs overvalued, or in a bubble (which, could be true).  However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the bandwagon.   Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford‚Äôs market cap is literally half of NIO‚Äôs (who has 7,000 employees).  I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional car companies have in comparison to these startups gives them a HUGE advantage.  But now that these guys are finally making their own EV‚Äôs, investors rate starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well.  I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but never that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an ‚Äúenergy company‚Äù and blah blah blah.

So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of the last 2 days, as Tuesday we saw the stock market rally with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/bR7cJ13) gaining over 1.5%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/fXZYKRS) rising by .81% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/yhDLD82) Industrial gaining 116 points to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kJPWrR3) dropped over 4.5%.  Over 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/BT7vfL0) were advancing with over 200 new highs on above average volume as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/M7wNJ2Q) finished in the green with Energy, Communications &amp; Technology leading the way while Real Estate was the biggest laggard, as growth companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/zbgJRWC) with small-caps gaining more than 1%, while Large-Cap Value was the biggest underperformer.  [HERE](https://ibb.co/Dbb47Jn) is the HEAT MAP from Tuesday, as you can see most big tech companies were gaining with Google, Facebook &amp; Alibaba posting a gain of more than 3% while the biggest laggard was the consumer defensive sector.  Yesterday we also saw the broad stock market finish with all 3 major indexes at all time highs as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/s3D1kvZ) lead the way, up almost 2%, while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9hV9fhV) gained 1.36% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/5B3r1D5) rose 257 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/P9mtRCH) dropping more than 7% after the removal of this big political event.  We didn‚Äôt see that many companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zZzFY6b), with only 57% of them gaining on average volume though 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/cTszSd6) finished in the green with Communications leading the way after a huge spike in Netflix, while the Financial sector was the only one to lose ground as Large-Cap Growth companies [outperformed](https://ibb.co/8mVHFyx) the rest of the market, with Large-Cap value play finishing the day down almost 1%.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/LvGDryV) from yesterday with all big tech names gaining over 2%, as Amazon, Google &amp; Netflix all gained more than 4% while the biggest laggards were seen in the banking &amp; biotech sectors.  We didn‚Äôt get to much economic data in the past days, with the most interesting one being the Redbook store [sales](https://ibb.co/zPDB0pj) which improved slightly over last week, as the economic calendar was on pause, awaiting the inauguration of the new US president.  [Today](https://ibb.co/jgJ1frz) we start getting more economic data, as we start off with Jobless Claims early in the morning and close with the Money supply and the FED‚Äôs balance sheet. We have to see if last week was just a blip or if the jobless claims will continue to rise even more.  In some other stock market news, we saw [Netflix](https://ibb.co/54tB18g) miss the earnings/share but beating both the revenue, and especially the net adds of subscribers, which came in at 8.5M vs the 6M expected as the biggest streaming platform has passed 200M subscribers. Netflix spiked [yesterday](https://ibb.co/B6zTrSp) more than 16% and closed at an all-time high as they have hinted at a sustainable free cash flow after 2021, as the company will no longer seek to raise debt and is expecting to start stock buybacks in the next years, which will be a great positive for shareholders. Another benefit is their pricing [power](https://ibb.co/s93DdWz) , as they have just increased their most popular subscription plan by 1$ and they can do this even further with minimum risk of losing to much of the subscriber base. I really like 3 companies in this sector (Netflix, Disney &amp; Roku) and I think you should own all 3 of them as this is the future, while the old TV and cinema world is dying.  We also saw [GM](https://ibb.co/hyb3GSB) rising after entering a new strategic relationship with Microsoft. This looks like a nice partnership between the two, with GM using Microsoft‚Äôs cloud computing to develop their Cruise venture, which is a subsidiary of GM. And on the other hand, this deal will provide needed capital to Cruise to fast-track their self-driving tech while also making Microsoft, GM‚Äôs preferred public cloud partner. I think GM is a very good play on the EV world with massive production capacity and good battery technology.  [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/Q9JYY6D), we saw Jack Ma finally show up after numerous speculations of his disappearance. This is finally some good news for Alibaba and the shares are up over 6% since the spotting, after those speculations led to a continued sell-off in the stock as investors feared China‚Äôs Government implications around the company. Alibaba is still a great company that will remain one of the biggest e-commerce companies in this new world, and that is still fairly undervalued right now.  Sports betting soared again after the latest reports of new [records](https://ibb.co/KF1Wy78) in Pennsylvania with over $500M in wagers in December, and is also expected to go live in Michigan on [Friday](https://ibb.co/9spwZMT). Morgan Stanley also [expects](https://ibb.co/3CSLKFT) more states to push to the legalization of sport betting even faster than expected. I personally like companies like DKNG, PENN &amp; WYNN in this sector and I am not planning on selling in the near-future any of them.  We also saw investment banks crushing earnings in the past days with [Goldman](https://ibb.co/6rzBBNh) crushing earnings by almost $5 and an increase of 18% y/y in revenues while Morgan Stanley also [BEAT](https://ibb.co/Lp3dJbp) expectations with an EPS beat of 64 cents and an increase in revenues bigger by over $2B than expected. I think the financial sector is pretty fairly valued right now after the huge run it has seen in the past [months](https://ibb.co/k0wTBVn) and it might only see another boost if rates go up, but that will inversely affect the rest of the stock market, so overall they might be a nice hedge against a potential rise in rates in the next years.  And one final thought is that I think staying invested in the markets is the best way to go as always. Even if the market experiences a short-term pullback or correction, I believe this will be short lived. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we see tax increases or not, it doesn‚Äôt even matter who is president‚Ä¶ You should stay invested and look for the best opportunities in the markets.  [HERE](https://ibb.co/1QxtfSH) is the average SP500 return since 1933 under each president, and both averages are way above 5% for each party, far exceeding inflation expectation for the future, so stay invested, look for the best companies and hold even through tough times and even look to add on any weakness in the markets. Keep in mind that the [SP500](https://ibb.co/DKym45m) return for the first 100days of a new president is usually very good, with the last 3 terms returning at least 5%. We can also see the [DOW](https://ibb.co/VDG7vyC) has returned over 10% on an annualized basis for each of the past 3 terms, which is way over the historical average.  Biden has had the biggest [rally](https://ibb.co/wYZKGmT) between the election date and the inauguration date in the past 70 years, so, don‚Äôt expect huge gains like we have had since March, but do stay invested even if the markets start to see a slowdown‚Ä¶ Your money is better off being invested rather than siting in a regular bank account where they will do nothing.  So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/9Z075Fy) markets seem to be pointing to another good day, after Biden‚Äôs inauguration and Janet Yellen‚Äôs latest remarks on the economy and the need of big spending, while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/rf6B1Z0) are also pointing to a green open, with the DOW leading the way.  **Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

For those autists out there that are too dumb to click the links, here is the TDDR for you ‚Äì   Apple is going to market a car in 2024. QNX makes car software work in EV. Apple is rumored to be expanding its office in Canada, their current office is right fucking next door to Blackberry/QNX. Apple has already siphoned of *some* of the QNX staff, but not all, and not the source code.  Apple needs QNX software for their EV. Blackberry has 38,000 patents, with 10,000 of those with the word ‚Äòvehicle‚Äô in the patent. Apple can use these patents.  Apple needs these patents to get into a new car market.  They are going to get their ass sued off when they start selling cars. Tesla could also use these patents.  Uber, Ford, GM, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, could use these patents. And the QNX software and software team.   Apple is (my guess only) making a bid for Blackberry to scoop up the rest of the QNX team, the source code and the patents.  Tesla may be making a counterbid.  Other players might be involved.  Elon uses the QNX code already in his spacecars.  I don‚Äôt know anything factual, because I am a retard, this is only my guess based on the link, the reddit post above and logic.  My autism has really progressed well since I am no longer a üåàüêª.   The only logical autistic, retarded conclusion is that Blackberry stock is going to be worth $25B within the month.

Currently No-Positions in any automotive stonks (or much of anything other than fighting for GME at the moment)  Background: No financial background. I‚Äôm just a failing engineering student who washes dishes to gamble his way out of debt.  Rockets for the autists üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ    Please give me feedback (good or bad)  **1.** **Ford and GM are not Tesla, but they can be damn close**  They do not have a space division or Tunneling company to influence their stock price. They are more focused on the automotive industry. This can be good to be zeroed on making good vehicles, but all of the chips are in on their vehicles performing to expectations. A slip up like the Tesla fire can be a real threat to our short-term gains. Additionally, their CEO‚Äôs (Jim Farley and Mary Barra) don‚Äôt meme their stocks so don‚Äôt expect blessings from the lord.   On the other hand: A ton of R&amp;D and public rallying behind EV has already been done for them by Musk and smaller EV brands, they just have to perform well to compete. We know how much Elon wants to standardize his charging plugs for his cars and any upcoming compatibility news between brands is a üöÄ  **2.** **Current supply shortages**  I‚Äôve seen the news that Subaru had to cut its production back due to the global shortage of semiconductors. It is important to remember that not just the auto industry is going green. Look at the price of lithium stocks recently and rare earth stocks. Other industries like green energy farms (Solar, Wind, Tidal) are also popping up and need these resources.  As we are starting to break away from Covid-19 hurting business, and people start to get back to work and buy things like cars. (Ford and GM were up on quarterly earnings through Covid regardless) a greater demand for cars, more specifically EV vehicles may drive demand past supply of said vehicles. This in turns leaves a shortage and Car/EV prices to increase. How can people buy new cars if there are no new cars to buy?  On the other hand: As the shortage of supply becomes more and more apparent in the market. There will be a balancing force to restabilize. I see this as increased efforts at recycling metals, and plastics as well as new mining operations for precious metals. This is very much in line with the going green policy and some of it now even now begins to take place. Lucky for us lithium is a pretty abundant resource also so I am not worried about battery shortages. Check newest $PLL and $LAC mining agreements.   **3.** **Industry and the market adapting in the coming years**  I know a lot of you retards aren‚Äôt in this for the long haul but this may affect you if you are in it long enough to see these cars come to fruition. This kind of goes with the last one in regards to keeping price down so people can buy. As manufactures begin to struggle to source a supply of materials, a shift in design is going to have to occur to maintain sales. I see this shift as being new smaller/lighter vehicles focused on efficiency as a majority of production but EV SUV‚Äôs and Pickups definitely still being on the menu based on the success and sentiment of Tesla‚Äôs larger vehicles and other SUVs/Pickups in general.   On the other hand: Companies like Ford and GM don‚Äôt have to rush into an all EV lineup, they‚Äôve been making gasoline vehicles and can/will continue to do so as the market continues to shift to EV. This still gives them a source of revenue and should keep the earnings reports positive even as supplies for EV development are scarce.    **If I were to go in what would I do?**  One of these options.  1. I run as far away from these as possible.  2. Go for the low commit play. I would buy into the hype early. I‚Äôm broke right now because of GME yolo but I could get in like 50-60 shares unstressed. We may see a discount on 1/21 with the Tesla fire to go in on Ford for the Rivian Potential. Hold till any more news hits then scram (not pussy paper hand news like ‚ÄúOMG Ford is a dead brand will be back to $8 easy‚Äù I‚Äôm here for gainz).  3. Buy some calls. I‚Äôm not really fluent in options so pardon my retardation but this could be a learning experience given the potential once I do some catching up and get some more gains than just buying shares. If you do not know anything about options do not trade options. Then again this is r/wallstreetbets and I‚Äôm not your wife‚Äôs bf.  4. Actual smart investment. I‚Äôm kind of in this with GME and looking past the meme and hype train and see some actual potential for these stocks and for GM and Ford to get their shit together. Jim Farley seems promising for Ford to make a difference and anyone with half a brain cell wants to get a piece of Tesla‚Äôs EV pie. I really believe that Ford has an opportunity to transform itself from a company that makes metal dogshit into something to compete with Tesla and at the very least be worth more than $15 a share.

Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.  * It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew ""tool bag"" Left of Citron at 6:58 derailed the party and send shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36 as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.  * Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35.   * NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.  * GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.  * Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.  * Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.  * Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.  * In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.  * The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.  * Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close.

They're going balls deep raw and betting everything on this clean energy future shit:**  * They announced a new division in GM called BrightDrop, where they'll produce electric vans for commercial delivery companies. Their first customer is FedEx and production will begin 2nd half of this year. This is not some fake ass partnership like with these other Spacs, it's the real fucking deal. * GM CEO Mary Barra said they'll be investing $27 billion fucking tendies to develop EV's and automated technology over the next 5 years. * GM said they expect to release 30 new EV models by 2025. I know some of you autistic fucks have reading comprehension problems, this mean WITHIN the next 5 years we'll get plenty of catalysts coming gradually. * Their all-new modular platform and Ultium batteries: GM is partnering with LG Chem to make these low-cost and efficient batteries. Their expectations are up to 400 miles per charge with 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. They'll have energy ranges from 50 to more than 200kWh. Support for all-wheel applications. This gives them a shit ton of flexibility for a wide range of vehicles. * GM's Ultium battery platform and powertrain is so great, that Japanese car manufacturer Honda has signed a deal with GM so they can build some of their EV's in the near future. * Their first release EV is the newly designed Hummer which will come later this year. Lebron has been shilling it on his instagram  **GM has strong financials and an extremely undervalued valuation compared to their EV peers:**  * Their revenue last quarter was $35.47B, Tesla revenue was $8.77B, Nio revenue was $666 million. Put that into perspective relative to their valuations. * GM already has solid cash flow, high-margins, a strong balance sheet. Which is a rarity compared to its EV competitors. * GM is a cash cow and has the ability to outspend its competitors easily, while scaling quickly with their various number of factories. * They'll be reinstating their dividend soon * GM PE Ratio is 22.41, TSLA is 1,579.66, and others in the space even autistically higher  GM is not the next Tesla, but it has significant room to grow relative to its valuation as the company shifts to more EV future. It can quickly steal marketshare in the industry and scale fast to outpace their other competitors. GM is easily going over $70 and their options are dirt fucking cheap with great deltas.

If you don‚Äôt want long shit skip to positions and TLDR. If you want me to search a ticker, you can comment it or PM me and I‚Äôll try my best to get to it and we can talk shop. * ________________  Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I‚Äôd share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea.   *REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*  **The way I‚Äôll break this down is by laying out my..**  **C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula.   **B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks.   **A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.    **C choices some whales bought:**  **FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar** [UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg) **FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%) **SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22 **Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES  **Earnings Reports**: Mid February  **Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.  **Why I don‚Äôt like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but  **IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you‚Äôre giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources.   **Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.  **B choices**:  [**PEP** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg) **Unusual Whales**: No alert **Earnings Report**: February 11th  **Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.    **[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I‚Äôll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he‚Äôs switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.  **Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.  **FB**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg) **Unusual Whale alert**: No **Earnings Report**: 1/27  **Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They‚Äôve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought.   **IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.  **Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c  **DVN**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies)  [DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg) **Unusual Whales alert**: Yes **Earnings Report:** Feb 16th  **Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.  **IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.  **News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news  **Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.  **A list:** [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%)   **Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too.   **IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).  **Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing.   &gt;While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it‚Äôs hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment‚Äîor lack any treatment at all‚Äîthen the stocks will fly.   **Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.  **Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I‚Äôm trying to connect some dots on:**  [1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg) I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend... [2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg) I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.  I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines.   **Open Interest change notables**: 1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc). 2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10 3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes 4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  **Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5  **Positions:** **PEP** 145c 2/12 **FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c **DVN** 2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **EDIT**: 2/5 77c **INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge) **VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans.   *waiting for a dip for some of these because I‚Äôm Nervous about Thursday.*   **TLDR**: Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  *This doesn‚Äôt update so I‚Äôll put screenshots and stuff if more interesting stuf comes in when I check in the daily thread.

Recently, I decided why not both?  A little background: GM has some short term catalysts in 2021 as a recovery play. It sold the most trucks in the US in 2020 and apparently isn‚Äôt yet affected by a semiconductor shortage that is forcing Ford to idle some plants, but the real story here is Cruise.  GM owns Cruise, the SF-based autonomous vehicle technology company, that plans to offer autonomous taxi and delivery services. The total addressable market is $5-8 trillion according to the Cruise CEO.   ‚ÄúDan Ammann, CEO of the GM majority-owned autonomous vehicle subsidiary, on Wednesday said that valuation includes autonomous ride-hailing services to compete against current companies such as Uber and Lyft at a potentially $5 trillion sector; $2 trillion for freight; and $500 billion each for data insights and in-vehicle experiences.‚Äù Source: [CNBC ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/gms-cruise-values-autonomous-vehicle-industry-at-8-trillion.html)   *Why now?*  1) Cruise had once aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called ‚Äòdriverless‚Äô vehicles by the end of 2019 (so they must have thought they were pretty close). Cruise started fully autonomous taxi service in SF in December 2020  2) In January, Cruise hired the former COO of Delta, another pretty strong signal they are getting ready for commercialization.  3) In a recent earnings call, GM CEO indicated they were open to a sale of Cruise which was last valued at $19bn. In this market, if they show any sign of progress, should be $100bn (vs current market cap of GM of $71bn). If GM retains minority control, it‚Äôs all upside. [Deutsche Bank analyst who asked the question on earnings call explains](https://youtu.be/12XMATuP3_0)  4) GM crushed it at CES, unveiling a flying drone and new business called BrightDrop, ‚Äúecosystem of electric products, software and services to help delivery companies transport goods more efficiently‚Äù  *Price Target* üéØ üåù   In December, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Adam Jonas raised its price target to $57, USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 30% to account for execution risk. That‚Äôs insanely conservative in my opinion, but hey let‚Äôs go with it for a second. Back of the napkin, if the present value is $57/share and the discount rate is 30%, that implies a future value of $420.69 in 7.6186 years. This market has been making moves in dog years and Jonas‚Äôs call was made in Dec, so that means we celebrating New Years 2022 in tendie town.  But seriously, I think we are going to $100 this year which Jonas also cited as a ‚Äúblue sky‚Äù bull case. Under that scenario, Cruise is spun off at $100bn valuation.

Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.  PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:  This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.  ([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.  ([https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects))  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  *Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.  Sweet summer child..  Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.  GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))  Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.  Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**  So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.  TLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. üöÄüöÄüöÄ  &amp;#x200B;  Position:  Wait for good entry: PLUG 70C 06/18. Yes its fucking expensive, wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads, dumbass. You bet big and win big.  If you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke: Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen. Im in for PLUG 100C 1/20/23, and will load up even more because its as high as Robinhood's shitty platform lets me go. **SPREADS, LEARN HOW TO DO THEM, STOP BEING POOR AND LOSING YOUR TSLA GAINS ON SHITTY PLAYS.**  Have fun playing.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors.[7] It also has joint-ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and Russia (Ford Sollers).  Ford was recently recommended by Cramer as a [buy](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stock-market-today-with-jim-cramer-ford-amazon-deutsche-bank-trump). After he did so, I began my DD.  **The Current State of Ford**  Ford has done what many other automakers have done - they have shifted to unibody platforms allowing production to swap based on demand. We all know the F series is Ford's bread and butter - they have been able to capture a large portion of the light-truck market. That isn't what has me excited - they've been able to do that for years.   It's no secret that Ford was behind the ball on hitting new technologies. Their previous CEO, Jim Hackett, was slow to adapt and shares fell 40% under him.  They have a new CEO who has been restructuring operations and shifting the focus away from milking the F-Series market and focusing on autonomous vehicles, EV and higher profit margins.   There are two factors that I think provides Ford a big opportunity to grow in the short and long-term.  * Factor 1 - Ford is severely undervalued in the market. Ford is the fifth largest auto maker and has had a small rally of 26.78% over the last three months. That still puts them well below their five-year high (-$23.44% over the last 5 years) with only a current market cap of 38.909B. GM by comparison, has made a 53.65% run in the last 3 months and has a market cap of 69.748B. Tesla, has a market cap of 809.90B. Ford has a lower market cap than many much smaller auto makers - it has room to roll.  **Factor 2 - EV Fleet vehicles. Ford has already dipped their toes into the EV market with the Mach E. I don't believe Ford electrifying their F-Series trucks is a large future just based on the lack of overlap between EV demographics and the F150 demographic. What I do believe is the future is using the E-450 platform for commercial uses, like electric shuttle busses and more. There are other companies whos business model is to [use the E-450 platform to do so](https://www.phoenixmotorcars.com/products/). Ford having the platform and now technology in place leads me to believe this is going to be an emerging commercial sector.   **My Positions**  tldr; Ford is undervalued and has a bright future under current leadership, which is focusing on emerging technologies.   Here are my current positions:  1. Stocks; 2. The Leap - 1/21/22 $12 C; 3. The Yolo - 1/15/21 $10 C.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1830582|public|confidence|self|||Ford [$F]- the Jim Cramer recommended Boomer Stock that will go boom üöÄüöÄüöÄ|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx6irw/ford_f_the_jim_cramer_recommended_boomer_stock/|some_ads|7|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'beckf357abBnptOaT8yh3Lqebs5s8Rti49plY0ml8IM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b8b6d75f4b89f6427f76f54c04e7f97589d561', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aec76fbe1195e3078403caf51420e6acbf74b06', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d1e668153a93f39c15f2064139d88b4769cc6d6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4a1f334d05ecb0abe9f4fb9e3715a4c2bc8e269', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c358622b3c8f79435e9aa348331aec2f24ea02', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1228aed188d4c013d5cd4c6295b0a5484bce1a31', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 675, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t0UCfo4hPkH8QU95q3eRnURpZVWdXeK95pmEiScav-w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f64ac9c1c29e39d50ab6fdb40d621c851f8ee7d4', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-01-14|GM

WHY? HELLA TAILWINDS:  -FORD own‚Äôs 30% of Rivian a direct competitor to TSLA (Amazon owns ~30%)  -FORD is doing effective housecleaning and cost cutting, new CEO is there for business not family legacy bullshit. (Just canned South America)  -They cut the boomer ass dividend out of the stock  -FORD paid negative taxes of 600 million last year(rolls over to this year src: marketwatch)  -FORD revenues are 4x Tesla (F $155.9B vs TSLA $24.58B )at 1/20th the valuation(F $39b vs TSLA $796b)...   (if Tesla does ever drop, would expect people to invest in to stay in Auto)  -Under performed against peers (GM up 35% YOY while FORD only up 5%) OH AND THAT STOCK CALLED TSLA up 600%+ YOY  -The bronco is dope (just wait for the EV)  -OH AND THEY HAVENT RELEASED THE ELECTRIC F150 the most popular car in America.  Conservatively at GMs valuation this goes up 35% in the next 12 months. Brings it to at LEAST $15 bucks. Calls for $10 1/21/22 are only $1.64. (Math 15 - 11.64 = 3.36),   Conservatively you will double your money.   My money is spread on these and shorter term calls at the $10 strike. bargains for days.

Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let‚Äôs talk about this &amp; other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day  We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again &amp; continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small &amp; mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil &amp; Gas companies.  Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more &amp; more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it‚Äôs one of the best for long-term investing.  [Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED‚Äôs Beige Book.  While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it‚Äôs unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&amp;A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.  In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production &amp; airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it‚Äôs not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.  We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell &amp; hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell &amp; hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It‚Äôs expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services &amp; selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It‚Äôs seems a good &amp; interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.  In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK‚Äôs Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren‚Äôt good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan &amp; others.  We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.  And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.  So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.    üôèThank you everyone for reading!üôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

Lightning eMotors manufactures powertrains, complete vehicles, and charging solutions for the zero-emission medium-duty commercial market. The company was founded in 2008 and has a manufacturing facility in Loveland, Colorado. There are already 120 vehicles on-road, 1500 vehicles on order. 100% of 2021 and the majority of 2022 are already contracted. They hold a 50% market share in[ class 3 to class 6](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/tmg_2013/images/figurec-1.jpg) electric vehicles. The ticker symbol will change to $ZEV (cool ticker symbol) upon merging which is set tentatively for mid-February, 2021.  Product and Business  * All commercial vehicles are built in 2 stages - OEM ‚Üí Upfitter (Upfitters are responsible for decking out the trucks based on customer‚Äôs requirements. An ambulance truck‚Äôs interiors are different from a telecom providers‚Äô truck) ‚Üí Customer. * ZEV is in the business of manufacturing complete vehicles (based on chassis from OEMs), electrifying the existing fleet (this is basically removing the combustion engine and making it fully electric), charging stations, fleet management software, and financing the purchase orders.  KeyPoints  * A lot of interest has been towards companies like Hyliion, Rivian , Canoo, Arrival. Yes, they look really nice and sleek. But it presents a huge problem for fleet operators - The vehicles have not been tested to be able to depend on them and there is virtually no service partners or services network in the US. If a rearview mirror breaks down, it might take a week or more to receive them. Any downtime is loss of revenue for fleet operators. As ZEV orders its chassis from OEMs like GM, Ford, Hino, Isuzu, and Navistar, they are able to receive spare parts in a matter of hours if not days. Also, the warranty from OEMs carries over as well. This is a huge advantage that ZEV will have over other companies entering this space. * Last-mile fleets run 8 classes of vehicles from multiple OEMs (no OEM offers everything). ZEV is the only supplier today that has class 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and Fuel cell trucks/vans. Ford, Rivian, and Arrival have announced Class 2 EVs only. ZEV operates in a niche segment where it does not make business sense for OEMs to channel investments into. The Class 3 and above commercial segment is characterized by low volumes and diverse operational requirements. * ZEV can build/assemble about 15 Class 3 and 4 powertrains and vehicles per week right now on a single 8-hour shift. The coaches take a lot longer as they are much more complicated and not yet as automated (but much higher price). This production capacity only equates to less than 4K class 3 and class 4 vehicles. They need serious cash to be able to expand their manufacturing capacity to build 25k vehicles by 2025. * More eyeballs on the[ Amazon vehicles in San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1KURWf74o&amp;feature=youtu.be) provided by ZEV. One should remember that Amazon will never be able to source their entire fleet from a sole operator including Rivian. The pie is big enough to be shared by several players in this space.  Risks  * Execution risk as they try to expand their manufacturing facility to 750,000 sq.ft which is only currently at 250,000 sq.ft. * GigCaptial3, the SPAC sponsor does not seem to be bringing anything valuable to the table. They seem to be really good at providing 'SPAC in a box' type service, which in this case is perfect for ZEV as they are basically looking for more cash infusion and do not have to worry about all financial and regulatory concerns in going public. * As more competitors enter the space in the next 2 to 3 years, it could be a little harder in differentiating.

However, I still want to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.  **For y‚Äôall degenerates, just skip those next paragraphs and go straight to the picks. For y‚Äôall nerds who want to understand a thing or two about my program, keep on reading.**  * My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we‚Äôre not talking about the over discussed stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We‚Äôre talking about the next ones. * I‚Äôve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool‚Äôs insights.  **Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here‚Äôs how to interpret the stock picks.**  * The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn‚Äôt be considered an ‚Äúemerging stock‚Äù based on my model). * The ‚ÄúReasoning‚Äù I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program‚Äôs picks in order to understand why they‚Äôre generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.  **Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.  **Enough said, here‚Äôs the (small) list!**  **Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**  Market Cap: $6.5bn  Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.  Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.  **Magna International (MGA) +436%**  Market Cap: $22.7bn  Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.  Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple‚Äôs new car.  Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

leaps in order to take advantage of upcoming electrical grid upgrades. I talked to a ton of people, spent two weeks doing nonstop reading, am **narrowing the play to the Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR**). Please see an amended DD below. **This DD isn't TA.** It is a series of political, market, and energy trend facts/assumptions, within the technical realities of grid management.   * **WARNING**: this post is long. By necessity, one has to flesh out linear chains of reasoning in long form. I'll give you the one-paragraph **TLDR** at the end. No rockets.  * **Context:** This is a 10 bagger play but it'll take time, possibly 2-3 years. There aren't any options available for this. Prysmian is guaranteed to print, but slowly, but it is literally guaranteed to print. It think it'll double by EOY at least.   &amp;#x200B;  \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  &amp;#x200B;  Below is a series of **linear** chain of reasoning with known facts that lead to an outcome that is guaranteed but not priced in. The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years.   &amp;#x200B;  1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric.  2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the ""high"" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve.     1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)    2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.**  3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward.  4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running.  5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time.  6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left.  7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.**   [Solar Irradiance Map \(2018\)](https://preview.redd.it/uilz3fxoc0a61.jpg?width=5101&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25925051c0038ace93d3cd47392b88a231f1af0c)  [Wind Power Map--Note the Great Lakes, Midwest, and NE Corridor Offshore](https://preview.redd.it/dwhto5huc0a61.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f5b15711a5dbf1ee5454007d153d0504dad168a)  &amp;#x200B;  **However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe ""local"" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/g5cn24w2h0a61.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fcd18d57aea8a5ad24b080d9f5dc6e77e48d34a  &amp;#x200B;  [Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots \(Iceland, etc\) to population centers](https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif)  [This won't be surprising.

Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear.   &amp;#x200B;  * (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --&gt; population center is still needed.  * (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as ""the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere"". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids.     * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit.  * (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)  https://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58  * (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--&gt; heightened demand --&gt; green is cheap --&gt; it needs to be hooked in --&gt; regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit.   # Conclusion  I do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world.   \------------------  TL/DR:  **EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.**   Sorry no rockets. Also, there aren't options available, so you'll have to slow boat this."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1783350|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/G5vo1EUlANpwZEXqEgLZO1G7kfeW6j8XOqA_LAju2hY.jpg|90.0|140.0|It's a Boomer play but it's absolutely guaranteed to print: $PRYMY (Prysmian Group), a play on upcoming infrastructure/grid upgrades|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kst6uo/its_a_boomer_play_but_its_absolutely_guaranteed/|some_ads|7||||dark||||||||||2021-01-08|GM

QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!  &amp;#x200B;  **QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**  Intro to QS: "" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. ""  &amp;#x200B;  *First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*  ¬∑ Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)  ¬∑ Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)  * ‚ÄúQS Stock Risk:  This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.  Our recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.""**  ¬∑ Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.  ¬∑ Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.  &amp;#x200B;  *Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*  ¬∑ QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.  ¬∑ Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  ¬∑ More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).  ¬∑ We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.  ¬∑ QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.  ¬∑ QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.  ¬∑ While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \-- approximately $808 million.  ¬∑  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.  ¬∑ Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that ""subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.""  ¬∑ While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.  ¬∑ Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.  ¬∑ The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.  &amp;#x200B;  *After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*  ## ¬∑Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants  ¬∑ Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants ‚Äúwill become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.  &amp;#x200B;  *Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*  ¬∑ Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.  * Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms. * Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:  1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership, 2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%, 3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71% 4. L.

Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.  I also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)  &amp;#x200B;  Lastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.  &amp;#x200B;  My Tl;dr:  * Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future. * But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though. * Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do. * There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum. * People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations. * In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months. * Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to c.b.a.t (mods have banned because of market cap), another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause c.b.a.t to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \~$9. I am personally going long both.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.  &amp;#x200B;  Yours truly,  NathMcLovin!"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1779944|public|confidence|self|||QantumScape Corporation Due-Diligence!|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksenyv/qantumscape_corporation_duediligence/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2021-01-07|GM

II** **Acquisition Corp. II** announced the pricing of its $300 million IPO this evening and its units are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol ‚ÄúVTIQU‚Äù Thursday, January 7. Expected price entry for public investors is $10.  The new company aims to combine with an industrial technology, transportation or smart mobility business in the middle market. VectoIQ II is led by CEO Stephen Girsky, President and COO Mary Chan and CFO Steve Shindler.  Total SPAC deal count for 2021 year-to-date is now nine with $2 billion in gross proceeds raised. This offering is expected to close on Monday, January 11.  The company is led by CEO and Director Stephen Girsky, founder and Managing Partner of VectoIQ, Chairman of Nikola, and former Vice Chairman of General Motors; CFO Steve Shindler, a Director and former CEO of Latin American mobile telecom provider NII Holdings (Nasdaq: NIHD); and COO Mary Chan, a Managing Partner at VectoIQ and former President of Global Connected Consumer at GM. The company plans to target the industrial technology, transportation, and smart mobility industries.  The group's previous SPAC, VectoIQ Acquisition, went public in May 2018 and completed its acquisition of Nikola (NKLA) in June 2020. Nikola common stock closed Wednesday at $16.20, a solid premium over its original $10 offer price, but well below the high of $79.73 it achieved last June.  Potential ‚Äúhail mary theory:‚Äù If Tusimple does successfully go public in the US, it would be the first self-driving company in the world to do so on a major financial market. The initial public offering (IPO) could also blaze a trail for peers in need of capital.  The company expects to achieve profit with an unmanned fleet of 5,000 trucks with revenue of $300 million annually, according to Chen. It currently pilots autonomous trucking services with 70 roborigs on the highways of several cities in Arizona and Texas.  Risks: Market is oversaturated with IPO‚Äôs funded by SPAC‚Äôs - upwards of 25% this year.  The IPO would test investor appetite for risk as the development of robocar technology has been slower than expected.

Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.  Most small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.  The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.  We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).  [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.  If the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it‚Äôs very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn‚Äôt do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any ‚Äúbig tax changes‚Äù or any other ‚Äúbig regulation changes‚Äù. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn‚Äôt bet against the bull market that we are in right now.  In some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don‚Äôt think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.  Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN‚Äôs [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.  Meanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.  So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.

The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.  The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.  The Columns to pay attention too:  * EXP: Expiration of the contracts * Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised * Option Price: How much premium paid per contract * Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)  # Call Flow  *Processing img asn0bkz3de961...*  To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.  # Put Flow  *Processing img ncsrdwq6de961...*  Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.  # Target Flow  The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img 040n3avbde961...*  Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.  Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium....

CO2 Cetrificates  Maybe the most important point here. Telsa did [proft massively off of CO2 certificates](https://www.electrive.com/2019/06/04/gm-purchases-co2-certificates-from-tesla/) in the past and will continue to do so.

All I've added are a few edits for brevity. If you have a Twitter account, definitely give him a follow. 2. ""**OP is a gay bear.""** Full disclaimer, I neither own puts nor am short Tesla (although I'm definitely considering it). In fact, if Tesla were cheaper I would almost definitely be long. I'm posting this because, beneath all of the memes and shitposting, I know that all of us want to make money. Every little bit of information/analysis helps, even if we disagree with the end-conclusion. 3. **""Post is too long. Ban.""** This post isn't meant for you, please move along. I know it's wordy and there aren't any pictures, but this is meant for those in this sub who enjoy a bit of reading/research. If you aren't interested in a bit of reading, please scroll past. 4. **If you YOLO $TSLA puts because of this post, you deserve to lose your money.**  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  ***A single prediction for the New Year.***  *Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Board‚Äôs Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021. The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...*  *It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJ‚Äôs 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.*  *One can read the Journal article,* [*Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600)*, and draw two conclusions. One, ‚ÄúThis must be extremely dangerous,‚Äù or two, ‚ÄúSurely I can get rich quick too.‚Äù Human nature being what it is‚Ä¶ For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, ‚ÄúIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.‚Äù Whoa.*  *A series of Q&amp;A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up* [*@RomanRubinstein*](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)*) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. ‚ÄúMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,‚Äù goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.*  *A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.*  *Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales &amp; borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only ‚Äúmath‚Äù a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers don‚Äôt wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?*  *They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.*  *I never thought I‚Äôd again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990‚Äôs, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don‚Äôt understand ‚Äú$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,‚Äù that ‚Äústocks look forward, not backward‚Äù and that ‚ÄúP/E‚Äôs are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.‚Äù*  *The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest &amp; oldest growth &amp; income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. I‚Äôd written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales &amp; 80x earnings.*  *You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.*  *Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above today‚Äôs 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&amp;P 500 today is only \~$31 trillion &amp; global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.*  *I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM‚Äôs won‚Äôt play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldn‚Äôt the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?*  *Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality &amp; growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRK‚Äôs shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù 40x market multiple.*  *Berkshire‚Äôs shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. It‚Äôs become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isn‚Äôt even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.*  *Short selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions &amp; short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that* u/elonmusk *secured its entry in the S&amp;P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM &amp; $FCA.*  *Still, I‚Äôd never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.*  *Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990‚Äôs. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but weren‚Äôt in a position to understand risk.*  *Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.*  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **Responding to a PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:**  *You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla‚Äôs 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.*  *Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let‚Äôs say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k‚Äôs for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I‚Äôd presume that as market share expands ASP‚Äôs will have to fall to affordable. I‚Äôm trying to get to a revenue number.*  *Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \~102% for five years. Reasonable?*  *Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman‚Äôs report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman‚Äôs retention as selling agent, as a ‚Äúprospectus.""*  *If the shares were sold at an average of \~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let‚Äôs not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall,* [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) *was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by* [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) *and Elon‚Äôs associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.*  *So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that‚Äôs a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT‚Äôs 30%.*  *One last missing piece of information, which I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn‚Äôt produced a positive return on capital.*  *For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $5.56B, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?*  *Since I don‚Äôt lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let‚Äôs summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share.

Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.  # The 2021 TSLA trade plan  ## What moves the stock?  Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.  &gt;Institutional investors aren't selling  TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!  So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.  &gt;Retail investors aren't selling  What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.  &gt;Insiders aren't selling  Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.  So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.  This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.  # The Plan and Headwinds  Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.  **In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**  With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.  If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.  **In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**  I wrote about stock market DD here: [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com)"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1757719|public|confidence|self|||The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kobcex/the_tsla_2021_trade_plan/|some_ads|7|||#b8001f|light||||efb6a476-24c5-11e9-b89a-0ecd4fdb4da4||||||2021-01-01|GM

What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning!  First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!   So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.  We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.  We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.  Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull‚Äôs camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn‚Äôt get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn‚Äôt avoid getting into those.  We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.   Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.  Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.  The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.  We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November‚Äôs advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.  [Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.  In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.  We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.  Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.  Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it‚Äôs first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn‚Äôt experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.  And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don‚Äôt really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.  Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**  **\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.  So, let‚Äôs start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will impact developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company‚Äôs total net sales in the last fiscal year.  Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.  Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook‚Äôs with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.  We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that‚Äôs 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.  The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular.  They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.  But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to have more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.  The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you all kinds of information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.  I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.  We also shouldn‚Äôt forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.  And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also having self-driving capabilities.  It‚Äôs reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.  I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the actual manufacturing of cars. Apple‚Äôs current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.  But this Apple Car thing is so long out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.  And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.  I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don‚Äôt have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.  So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don‚Äôt be afraid to leave a comment down below.  I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.  This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let‚Äôs take a closer look at them, each on their own.  So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of revenue, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by a big margin the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.  The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.  The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.  The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.  I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to have more vertical integration.  And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple gets. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based revenue including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don‚Äôt forget any others.  So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.  I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.  In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.  In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company‚Äôs supplier‚Äôs ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.  So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.  I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.  I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don‚Äôt see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.  This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.  Moving on, let‚Äôs see what interest revenue and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both revenues and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.  This would bring the company pre-tax $$$ to just over $104B in 2025.  Let‚Äôs move on to taxes. I know the Federal tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the company will have around a 15% tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.  So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in $$ after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don‚Äôt even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today‚Äôs price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.  I don‚Äôt think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.  So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.  I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.  So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.  Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?  The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.  So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?  Let‚Äôs look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn‚Äôt have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it‚Äôs likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.  So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.  Thank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

The wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.   But this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?  Before I proceed, I know most people who read my posts can't read, and I am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text, so here is the short form  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**   https://preview.redd.it/ddzg718of5861.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b39c19f793dee8366fc2bafbc55bfe49d49836  This was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017  [https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)    I started by looking at the S&amp;P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today‚Äôs technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.  There is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if¬†the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.  I agree with Peter Thiel‚Äôs thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the ‚Äúworld of stuff‚Äù. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched ¬†out like a tree and¬†built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed ¬†into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.  So I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.  **Information Technology Cycles**  The following is my attempt at¬†describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.  Electronic Age   **Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace¬†physical labor.   (Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)  **Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.   (Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)  **Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.   (Important companies: AT&amp;T, NBC, IBM)  Computing/Software Age   **Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace¬†¬†basic mental labor.   (Important companies: IBM)  **From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.   (Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)  **Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.   (Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)  Cloud/AI Age   **Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.   (Candidate Important companies**:** AWS, Microsoft,¬†Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)  **Specialized AI¬†(2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing¬†the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies¬†and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various¬†parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.   (Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)  **General AI (2075-2100):**¬†Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.  The average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.  The initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:  In the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.  The proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).  The consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.  What it means today,  I would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal¬†increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.  **From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.  It is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting¬†segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.  2020 Update:  If we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever.    I have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above s is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.  Also  to assuage of rumors, I am not Peter Thiel or Mike Green.  Position Update;   Now have $220k in shares  (bought another \~$90k in shares yesterday, still about 30k (down from 50k) in calls. I fully expect to lose all my call value.  If it drops to 20, I'll add another 100k.

JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.  [Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.  We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.  We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.  While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.  Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.  [Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn‚Äôt yet announced anything.  In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can‚Äôt imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don‚Äôt have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.  We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.  Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman‚Äôs chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US Gross domestic product by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a Gross domestic product growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

Sure, my DD on [SOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/) has not come to fruition (yet) but 3 for 4 in the last 2 months is not too shabby. In MLB, I would be a .750 hitter and would qualify for HOF but that‚Äôs a separate ‚ÄúStory Time‚Äù shit-posting for another day.  Today, I am here to share my next DD. And unlike my other DDs, this is a bit speculative.  TLDR: If Apple is building EVs, MGA is likely the manufacturer based on their past partnership and the fact that Apple likes to outsource manufacturing.  **So, what the hell is Magna?**  Today, let me tell you about this sleeping giant called MGA. Few years back (circa 2014-2016), when people first started hearing about Project Titan, aka Apple EV project, MGA was in talks to manufacture Apple EVs for Apple. Dozens of Magna‚Äôs engineers were working with Apple to develop Apple‚Äôs new baby.   For those who are not familiar with Magna, the company is considered as the world‚Äôs biggest contract manufacturer for cars. (Think FoxConn for iPhones or Taiwan Semiconductor for chips)    A big part of their business is to help automakers to manufacture their vehicles when these automakers lack the resources (i.e. factories) or time to build the cars themselves. For OEM automakers, their current and past customers include big names like BMW, Volkswagen and Aston Martin.  [Check out Bloomberg‚Äôs feature on MGA back in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-magna-international/)  **Ok. So they are like FoxConn to Taiwan Semiconductor, but for manufacturing cars. So why are they not üöÄ üöÄ if they are in bed with Apple?**  Well, Apple‚Äôs Project Titan went through a lot of changes since 2016. It struggled with direction, leadership and technical challenges. the guy who lead the project, Bob Mansfield, left the company and then was brought back. They laid off a lot of people from the project and then retooled the scope of the project with focus on autonomous driving and a new battery technology. During this time, their previous deal with Magna also died out.  But now the project is back on track with a rumor to launch as early as 2024. Recently, various companies started mooning based on pure speculation that Apple might be using their parts for the project. (I.e. LIDAR)  However, there‚Äôs not much talk about who would build the cars. Well, Apple normally designs the product, but outsources the manufacturing. Considering that other EV manufacturers needed to build their own factories in various parts of the world, Apple would need to do the same. However, their business model would suggest that they would outsource the manufacturing and since MGA was once a partner for Project Titan, it is reasonable to think that Apple will choose MGA for future manufacturing as well. Eventually, news will reach the public but in absence of any news that Apple is making capital investment to build its own auto manufacturing factory, it would likely tap a third party like MGA because Apple lacks the expertise to manufacture cars themselves.  **Ok, But what if MGA is not picked by Apple? What then?**  Well, you ungrateful bastard. I‚Äôve already told you that this DD is a bit different and it‚Äôs more speculative than the others.   Considering that MGA is the leader in this field, and Apple tapped them before, two things are clear. One, Apple showed their hand that they intend to outsource the manufacturing in the past. Two, MGA has the relationship and familiarity with the Apple Project.   But Magna has other trump cards in its deck. One, Fisher tapped MGA to build their electric SUVs and the production is expected to begin in 2022. As part of this deal, MGA received 6% of Fisher stock warrants so you know this relationship is going to be a long term partnership.  Secondly, LG Electronics formed a joint venture with MGA to develop EV power trains and other EV parts. LG works with General Motors and Jaguar, so this joint venture can potentially lead to deals with those automakers and it positioned MGA further as a leader in this field of car manufacturing.  Finally, even though they are strengthening their position in EV manufacturing, their bread and butter is their existing contracts with companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW and BMW. In China, MGA has even inked a deal to build entire electric cars for BAIC Group, as many as 180,000 cars annually with the first batch of cars arriving now.  **Recommendation**  Right now the stock is trading around $70~ per share with market cap of only $22 Billion.   Over the next 12 - 24 months, EVs continue to be a hot topic. As more and more people convert to EVs, more EV stocks will moon and MGA will benefit from that conversion. But, if and when Apple confirms MGA as their manufacturer as they disclose more info about their EV between now and 2024, this stock will üöÄ üöÄ beyond your dreams.

A stimulus deal has finally been agreed on! CarMax Reports earnings before the bell. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**  **\~Very Long Post\~**  Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a very bad open after the UK [news](https://ibb.co/gRtBKsQ), but things did turn around as the big 3 indexes mostly recovered, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PrY0RJx) finishing down just 0.10% for the day, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/8gTGLps) even posting a small gain finishing up 0.12% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/tppPJ2r) lost 0.39% dragged down by the recent addition, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/dB2pbc2), which finished more than 6% down for the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0GHcjF4) opening very high and was up more than 30% at one point before eventually finishing the day around the 25 levels, as the new strain in the UK caused some panic selling and overreactions in the stock market in my opinion. [Here](https://streamable.com/832r8c) is a short-clip from the Admiral Brett Giroir, the US HHS assistant secretary sharing the facts on CNN yesterday, as there is a lot of misinformation going on.   So, he gave us reassurance, and I don‚Äôt believe there is anything to dispute [here](https://ibb.co/8XmJ4PL), as I have done a lot of research yesterday on the matter, as this strain has been circulating for 3 months already and is not something new with the only point of concern being that this one is more transmissible and has become the most common in the UK. This should not impact the effectiveness of the vaccines and has not been proven to be more lethal than any other strain. So, hopefully the vaccines become more available as fast as possible so that we can get past this whole thing already.  [Yesterday](https://ibb.co/8N8qSgR) more than 60% of the companies were losing ground on above average volume, as companies have started to have some retracements to the 50-day moving averages. Only one of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/z6P1DDX) in the SP was gaining yesterday, with Financials gaining 0.81%, while Energy, Real Estate and Utilities finished the day down more than 2% as growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/RgBp7cP), especially the mid and small-caps.  Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ncyyDVm) from yesterday, as there was a whole lot of red going on, with only the biggest tech companies in the world having some small gains, with Microsoft &amp; Apple up more than 1% while Amazon &amp; Google also finished barely up for the day. We Also got the US banks which did pretty good following the FED decision to allow share buybacks again and Nike also surging after terrific earnings. We also saw some of the biggest losers in the oil &amp; gas industry joined by Tesla which saw a significant pullback after the SP500 inclusion.  Meanwhile, the US Congress finally [passed](https://ibb.co/4f0zbdv) a $892B bill after many months of gridlock that is expected to be signed into law by Trump. The bill will include $600 payments to most American. The bill which is more than 5K pages long also includes a federal spending budget of over $1.4T and has a net cost of only $350B in relief spending with the rest coming from unspent money from the previous bill.  [Here](https://ibb.co/3dcfyNc) are the most interesting economic reports coming today, with the GDP revision, consumer confidence index and home sales coming early in the morning.  We also get a single big earnings report today, coming from [CarMax](https://ibb.co/k4vtbFp) which will show us how the second-hand car market is doing, this may impact other stocks like Carvana and even car manufacturers. So, will writing this, CarMax released the [earnings](https://ibb.co/Z2r0qBy) and delivered a beat on the top and bottom line but underwhelmed on comparable store sales which were down 0.8% vs the 4.1% increase expected. I will come back tomorrow and discuss more about this after I get into the earnings report more in-depth.   In some other stock market news, [GM](https://ibb.co/dMJrMQd) has landed 10K pre-orders for the new Hummer EV for the Edition 1 model which will be listed well above the $100K mark and will start production next year, this is another manufacturer that is going to keep putting more and more pressure on Tesla‚Äôs EV market share.  Tesla also continued to drop yesterday after [reports](https://ibb.co/sgvtSh3) that Apple is moving forward with a self-driving car by 2024 that would include its own breakthrough battery technology. Apple has started this project in 2014 but this had low interest from the company in the past years, has recently been brought back into focus, as they are targeting a unique mono-cell battery design that could radically reduce the cost and increase the range of the vehicle. Though I believe this is very unlikely to happen, as Apple is more likely to license this kind of technology, or maybe they will try to rely on some kind of a manufacturing partner rather than start manufacturing their own cars  We also saw the whole solar energy stock rallying again after reports that the spending bill will [include](https://ibb.co/N2q4RWp) $35B in energy R&amp;D programs, with an extension of the Tax Credit for solar &amp; wind power.  While another stay-at-home winner, [Peloton](https://ibb.co/dbhH7xQ) just agreed to acquire Precor for $420M as they seek to expand the market share and the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with the big demand which has caused delays.  Another recent stock market favorite also received a one-year $114M option contract from the US army. This helped pushed [Palantir](https://ibb.co/q0dgSkK) almost 10% up in regular trading and more than 2% again in after-hours.  Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QkQymBh) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way.  Thank you everyone for reading!

Boomer in the comments:  If Musk changed his mind and said LiDAR is the future then every single person that rails against LiDAR would change their tune too. The argument is not about science. It‚Äôs tribalism. Waymo uses LiDAR but it also uses cameras, radar, and microphones. And Cornell isn‚Äôt even claiming cameras are better ‚Äì just that the are almost as good in most conditions. The ‚Äúaddition‚Äù of LiDAR is undoubtedly better. The question then is cost. Waymo is getting into the LiDAR selling business and has brought the cost down from $75k to $7,500. As the cost comes down and the device becomes more streamlined it might see widespread adoption. I don‚Äôt know the future. And neither does Musk. But right now, the technology is at least marginally better than his best effort and when we are talking about a kid running into the street to grab a ball I‚Äôd rather vehicles have the marginally better technology. Regulators may agree. And again, costs are coming down so his arguments about the cost are becoming less valid and less relevant. And yes, Telsa has a major advantage in real world conditions. But only with cameras and they have no data on LiDAR so they are not light-years ahead of the competition. Not Waymo. And the fact that some people on here think that Tesla‚Äôs autopilot is more than just branding and that other high end apaptive cruise control isn‚Äôt the same‚Ä¶ is scary. Don‚Äôt treat it like autopilot! I like Tesla. I like electric cars. But I don‚Äôt like how science is turning into politics. Let LiDAR technology develop and if it works great. No one should be hoping it fails.  Other than maybe people that have a financial interest in Tesla and don‚Äôt value human life. Also, I don‚Äôt like that Tesla isn‚Äôt working harder to try to open its charging network to non-Tesla. Even charging a premium would be fine but don‚Äôt intentionally stifle EV adoption. Tesla has done the impossible and that‚Äôs great but it doesn‚Äôt mean Musk doesn‚Äôt make mistakes. Look no further than his plan to automate his factories. It failed. But to his credit, he changed positions and admitted his mistake. If LiDAR comes down to sub-$2,000 I‚Äôd be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt adopt it. And while I‚Äôm on an epic rant, Tesla‚Äôs valuation makes no sense to me. I have always thought Tesla would be very successful so it is not that I‚Äôm betting against them. It‚Äôs just that if 10 years from now we have self-driving cars it won‚Äôt make sense to own cars at the same level as today. There will be a decline. And even if Tesla is a leader in autonomous vehicles it doesn‚Äôt seem possible that others won‚Äôt be competing in that space considering how evey car manufacturer has invested in adaptive crusie control tech dev (unlike EV‚Ä¶ which they lagged significantly). And it‚Äôs hard to imagine people will only use Tesla self-driving. Premium will have its place (limos) but people will tend to go with the cheapest functional self driving service ‚Äì that I‚Äôm sure about. So the next 5-10 years should be great but at best‚Ä¶ after that is unknown. At worst, expect car ownership to drop and self driving taxi companies to be a dime a dozen. Too hard to predict which means the value is too high. **The camera detecting autonomous driving systems are like investing in Garmin in the early 2000s because you think navigation systems are the future but ignoring that rise of smartphones with maps. (Smart phones is Lidar for the autists out there that don't get it)**  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  The above is something i copypasta'd from a boomer.   There's this technology that companies have been working on for years called Lidar.  There's a few companies that have the price around $10k per system but ""that's still too expensive to implement"". When firms like GM / Toyota / Volkswagen start funding these companies the tech gets here faster.   AAPL just said they'll get the best self driving and the best batteries. Kinda seems like they'll contract with QS and VLDR.  VLDR market cap still around $500M. If it gets to the size NIO is, that's a 100 fold return in SHARES. imagine calls bois. TENDIE TOWN  Also, I'd say LAZR is good because it's literally the only competitor but the market cap is higher and company looks like a big fat ol joke.

I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.  While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not.  I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?  If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?  Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it,  as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.  Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**  I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.  But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?  So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory in the next 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years,  but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is no under estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% per year, again not higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10 million cars, this is roughly $600 billion from cars. So this leaves you with another $250 billion or so for other things. Now this $200 billion is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion. This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from a revenue perspective, again, from *today's perspective.*  So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10 million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share), keep car prices same (which I think will go down substantially even with inflation), and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.  Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?  We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.  In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.  With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up).  I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using aggressive assumptions for 10+ years.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p86f1jbm86661.jpg?width=1690&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14679af1deedc9e3e04fdd564ccc006a862acc8a  &amp;#x200B;  You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.  Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*  So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

We are all autistic in some way, right? Well I'm üåà for cars and as such I am basically the same level of autism as horse girls. Anyone else into cars knows what I'm talking about. Lazer focus.   Anyway it's well known that Canoo is about reveal a new bangbus xl  on Thursday. Some people don't seem to care about it that much. Do you know who will care about it? FUCKING EVERYONE.   [if you take a trip down to canoo's Instagram](https://instagram.com/canoo?igshid=hwa85djv8uay) you'll see some recent posts teasing the van. No big deal, right? Look closer at the people interacting with the brand *frequently* and not letting too much go. Im talking people like:  [Bobby from queer eye ](https://instagram.com/bobby?igshid=mvc506ixupce) (different from a üåà üêª dont worry) with 2.8 million subs [this dude with 1.2m followers who is into #van life](https://instagram.com/everchanginghorizon?igshid=uetd3spahkxp) he's probably that guy that keeps picking your wife up for her private surfing lessons.   And most importantly for the car nerds:  [Johnny lieberman from motortrend](https://instagram.com/jonnylieberman?igshi d=i7toqecs807z) [the founder of rotiform - the same company that sponsors ken block](https://instagram.com/imsoovertheinternet?igshid=xzyk2u47scwj) [bisimoto](https://instagram.com/bisimoto?igshid=vnys0egfp08g) the mad man thats been super into building [insane EV creations like this porsche 935](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.motortrend.com/news/bisimoto-1984-porsche-935-ev/amp/), and this [batshit Honda odyssey with 1000hp](https://youtu.be/u0l6QMEiOdE) . He cut his teeth in Hondas but most recently he signed a deal with Hyundai.   Hyundai, you know, what you wish you could afford. Bisimoto has been building performamce cars for them. Anyway Hyundai is growing massively right now [and is an investor in canoo](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). Hyundai is even revealing their new ioniq 5 EV crossover this week, maybe even with some tech from canoo. Outsourcing and buying trademarks is common in the auto industry (flexfuel is a Koenigsegg patent for example and mag ride is GM)  But back to bisi. Whats the connection? I think all of these influencers are going to show off the new bangbus 2.0 in their own ways. Theres going to be a vanLIFE version that TRANSCENDS THE EV AND CAR INDUSTRY.... im talking the Becky industry. And maybe to the levels only apple has seen because the only thing that gets a girl fired up more than an iphone is being able to use that iPhone to post about the van life (something we on wsb have lots of experience in already, I am sure). Nothing as romantic as showering at the YMCA and pissing in an empty milk jug so you can watch the stars on a road you aren't 100% certain. You can sleep on. Take it from me; I've owned porsches, tuner cars, offroad rigs, and luxury cars. The one that has easily gotten the most love from everyone is my 1994 Mitsubishi delica  Now what about bisimoto? Well I garauntee he is going to show off a 1000hp canoo van race car. If you take a look at their gram you'll see some promos involving a race car driver. Its going to roll on rotiforms like the 2013 stance scene (if you dont get that reference be thankful). Recently on the Smoking Tire Podcast bisimoto kept getting giddy about future plans he had that he couldn't talk about that were supposedly mental. I bet these are the plans.    TL;DR Canoo is about to go on a marketing frenzy and become famous among the youth by the end of the week.

No? You are not some old ass boomer and therefore, you don‚Äôt even know what The Jetsons are?  Ok, fair enough. But chances are, you are probably retarded because you are wasting your time in this sub looking for tendies. And retarded people think the flying cars are coming (just like in The Jetsons).  But I hate to break it to you. The flying cars are not coming. Why? Because the popularity of this sub has turned most of the population quite retarded. No one is working in a garage somewhere working on a flying car. They are all watching Jim Cramer talking about autists and in turn, we are wasting time away in this sub for the next shitty stock that might make you tendies.  However, self driving cars are quite real. And today, we are going to look at the market leader in the technology that will allow us to get there.  **Self Driving Cars? How Real is This Shit?**  Oh, this shit is quite real. So real, in fact, you will hear about them often between now and the next 24 months.   1. All the Boomer car companies want to be valued like tech stocks. So GM, Hyundai, Ford, VW, and you name them. They are all entering into some sort of partnership with tech companies that are making the tech that is required to make this a reality. (And it doesn‚Äôt have to be full self driving. Any semi auto driving and driver assistance tech are high in demand) Call it a FOMO effect. The boomer car companies have been left behind by Tesla and other EV companies (in terms of investor excitement and stock valuation). So they don‚Äôt want to be left behind in this trend. So they are all signing up and spooning each other with companies like NVDA, Intel‚Äôs Mobileye, Google, Baidu, etc.  2. The taxi industry as we know it, will be transformed once again. Why? Remember when Uber and Lyft disrupted the traditional taxi/cab industry by offering the same service using an App? I mean, who wants to walk outside and hail a cab (hoping to catch one) these days. No one, unless you are a boomer. Well, the same companies that disrupted the traditional taxi industry are motivated to disrupt it once again because of the on-going debate on whether Uber drivers should be classified as employees or contractors. Solution? Get rid of the drivers and make them all autonomous to make CEOs rich and drivers unemployed.  3. The tech is here and available. And the key technology is something called LiDAR and the software platform that operates it.  **What is LiDAR and why should I care?**  Think of LiDAR as an eye of the self-driving vehicle providing it a 360 degree view. Just like a car that is driven and operated by a human being, a self driving car will need to figure out how to operate the vehicle thru traffic, potholes, trees and other obstacles on the road. Well, that‚Äôs what the LiDAR technology provides. It serves as the eye for the self driving cars so it can move in and out of the traffic and get its passengers from Point A to Point B.  **Ok, LiDAR is like an eye. But why should I care about Velodyne?**  Well, Velodyne is the undisputed leader in this field and right now, they have the backers (Ford, Baidu, Nikon, Hyundai, etc).  They are the established market leader, with first mover advantage. Per Needham, Velodyne is expected to own 60% of the market share of autonomous vehicle market by 2024. They have 300+ customers with $800 Million in contracted revenue thru 2024. Additionally, there‚Äôs an opportunity to incrementally add 60%+ increase in revenue over the same time period.  With their entrenched existing customers, there is a high switching cost. So unlike LAZR (which just lost Intel‚Äôs Mobileye), their existing customer would not be able to easily switch their supplier or look for another supplier without incurring significant switching cost.  But the most important aspect of their competitive advantage in the LiDAR sensor market has to do with their pricing. When David Hall first participated in DARPA sponsored autonomous vehicle competition in 2005~, each LiDAR Sensor unit cost about $80,000. Today, Velodyne is able to sell similar LiDAR sensors between $100 - $600 per unit. No other competitor can offer a similarly competitive product at the same price range.   Velodyne dominated this market for over 13 years. They have a broad product portfolio (not just LIDAR sensors) with global sales and mass scale manufacturing capabilities. They are not tied down to automotive market either as they currently expand to about 25+ new market segments.  Additionally, they can upsell to its existing costumers with their Vella Collision Warning System. This is Velodyne‚Äôs software solution to power their LiDAR products. They can offer automotive manufacturers with advanced capabilities including auto pilot, collision avoidance, pedestrian automotive emergency braking and more. Multiple automotive OEMs are in development on Velodyne‚Äôs ADAS projects with initial deliveries happening right now. There are no BS research turned production deals like LAZR. They have real revenue, real products and real customers.   Today, only 25% of their revenue is generated from LiDAR related technology. 75% of the revenue comes from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Robotics and Industrial Mapping, Shuttles, Smart City Delivery, etc.  **Ok. So they got cool stuff and real customers. But what about their growth prospects?**  Well, you greedy bastard. This company‚Äôs growth aspects are primed to make you tendies over the next couple of years. In fact, this might be the kind of dream growth stock that you can bank on.  1. Revenue Growth: Velodyne‚Äôs projected revenue for 2020 is around $100 Million. They are expected to grow their revenue to $150 Million next year, $250 Million in 2022, $412 Million in 2023 and $684 Million in 2024.   2. Earnings Growth: Velodyne is expected to incur losses of ($50 Million) this year. But they are expected to reduce this loss to ($8 Million) next year and be profitable from 2022 and forward. By 2024, they expect to be record EBITDA of $150 Million~.  3. Gross Margin: Velodyne‚Äôs gross margin on their LIDAR products is around 20% today. They expect to double this gross margin to 40% next year and continue to increase the margin from there.  4. Product Mix Trend for Revenue: Today, significant portion of Velodyne‚Äôs revenue comes from LIDAR and other automotive technology. But they plan to balance this out by increasing revenue from their software and license/subscription products going forward.  5. Amazon‚Äôs Zoox just launched a plan to start a robotaxi service in CA and NV by end of 2021 or early 2022 using Velodyne‚Äôs LIDAR sensors. BAIDU is expected to enter its own EV vehicles and they are investors of Velodyne and can certainly use many of the technologies (not just LIDAR) offered by VLDR. Nikon is using VLDR‚Äôs LIDAR tech for its lineup of products (similar to iPhone 12 Pro using LiDAR) going forward. As a market leader in the LIDAR tech and also leader in pricing advantage with backers such as Hyundai, BAIDU, Ford, etc, this is just the beginning.  **TL;DR**  Conclusion:  1. They have far superior LIDAR product and they can sell it at much affordable price point. They have over 300+ customers and the customers cannot simply switch to another supplier due to high cost of switching.  2. Current market cap is around $ 4 Billion (give or take). In comparison, LAZR‚Äôs market valuation is around $14 Billion. Never mind that LAZR has no real revenue (i.e. their recent filing indicates that all of their revenue is from interest income), lost Mobileye as customer only about a month after inking a deal, and they don‚Äôt have bullshit ‚Äúresearch turned into production‚Äù deals either. So the bottom line is that this stock is super cheap.  3. They will be profitable by 2022 and increase their revenue by almost seven folds by 2024. They are the undisputed leader with the right technology and the right backers/partners. Good news is only starting and for a change, it‚Äôs still not too late for you to get in.

My price prediction for Tesla. It is a very long post but read until the end of the post as I give my price target for TESLA long-term and also what I think will happen in the next couple of weeks**  Hey everyone and Welcome! This is a very long post just so you know but let‚Äôs go over some of the latest news on Tesla before moving on to some analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock.  So, Tesla has seen a huge move to the upside after the SP500 inclusion [news](https://ibb.co/j3F9CJM), as the stock started to surge with a 10% spike in just the first day and continue to [gain](https://ibb.co/fDz4J19) around 50% since that news came out, as the company has surpassed a [market cap](https://ibb.co/JRMGspK) of $500B, that means the company is valued more than Toyota, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda combined.  The EV world has seen a huge spike in the last couple of years and will continue to benefit a lot from the move to green energy. The EV short-term share of [sales](https://ibb.co/QpXc1Kj) is expected to rise in China to 15% by 2023 with the rest of the world lagging behind, but in the long-term, by 2040, most of the world‚Äôs regions are expected to have over 30% market share for EVs with China, Europe and the US leading the way as the Global market share should reach around 60% by 2040.  Also, Tesla seems to be on track to make new investments in [Indonesia](https://ibb.co/SndLK1N) as they hunt for Nickel, the most important component in batteries. The [price](https://ibb.co/wKfBckY) of this commodity has gone up almost 20% this year, hurting the possibility of Tesla to either make bigger profits or make cheaper cars that will attract even more buyers.  Meanwhile, it was just [announced](https://ibb.co/ZYfNpP6) that Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management with the ticker AIV in the SP500 which saw the its [stock](https://ibb.co/wK9YqrK) value plummet after the news. They will also replace Occidental Petroleum with the ticker [OXY](https://ibb.co/yFF01HH) in the SP100.  Other good [news](https://ibb.co/pxZypr4) came for Tesla from China, as they reported an increase of more than 100% year over year in EVs and hybrid car sales. With sales of electric cars from Tesla surpassing 21.000 in the last month. While overall car [sales](https://ibb.co/FXyXnhG) also increased in China more than 11% since last year to over 2.3M.  Also, the company has declared that they will [continue](https://ibb.co/s9Wp63Q) to sell around $5B in shares at market price from time to time. This usually is bad news for companies as the value of individual stocks gets diluted. Tesla is seeking to strengthen the balance sheet as they will have more than $20B in cash reserves after the latest stock offering in the next year, as the total cash reserves have been [increasing](https://ibb.co/C9GVYR6) steadily, as well as using part of the funds for general corporate purposes by getting out of the debt of the company while also continuing to innovate, as the company is [forecasted](https://ibb.co/ZdYPdX3) to spend around $50B in capex and R&amp;D in the next 5 years, more than double what GM is targeting to spend in the same period.  My opinion is that Musk is brilliant, he is selling stock at very good prices as young retail investors just keep buying this stock at any price. And with $5B in [SHARES](https://ibb.co/CVK554V) being under 1% of the market cap right now, this will help the company in the long run as more available money brings more stability and probably more research and developments.  So, before even starting, you should now that I am neither a convinced bear or bull that will not change his mind on Tesla. If you do believe this next valuation for the company, then you can agree that Tesla will not only be a car maker in the future, as they keep expanding into more &amp; more businesses like network services, energy storage, the internet-of-cars and even insurance.  The company is also undergoing major growth projects with 3 new [factories](https://ibb.co/mbMZKKX) fin different stages of construction in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, this will help them to have the ability to respond to the huge demand in the EV market alongside the already established Freemont and Buffalo factories.  I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.  This are my 2023 [projections](https://ibb.co/cyr3Sr8) for Tesla, I expect them to have around $112B in automotive sales revenue by that year, as I expect they will be able to sell around 2.8M cars worldwide at around a $40K price, which is way below the average $54K they sell cars at the moment. So, as the cheaper models become available, I expect this to decrease to around $40K, that seems pretty reasonable to me. I will give them around a 3% of the automotive sales in lease revenue, as they have stood around this rate in the past, as not many people lease Tesla‚Äôs.  I will also give them the benefit of the doubt of almost doubling the Energy revenues, as they stand at around $580M in the last quarter, so that would be around $2.4B on an annual basis. And will also give them around 10% of the automotive sales in services and other revenues as this has been a pretty steady number in the past for the company.  You can see in the latest [earnings](https://ibb.co/FKyY0mm) report that the company has been improving almost in every department in the last quarters with the exception of Q1 this year as they were forced to shut down part of the operations at the end of Q1 and the start of Q2.  This is what my projections are based on in both revenues and expenses.   So, about the [expenses](https://ibb.co/WPYsV2g) expenses in 2023, I will lower the expense margin from around 72% where it stands at the moment to around 70% where Musk‚Äôs target is in the future as this has been improving in the last years for automotive sales. I will also keep the same expense margin on leases and services. While on Energy expenses I will be more conservative and give them a 90% expense margin, even if this might improve to 80-85% if they do want to raise the price for the products and sacrifice some growth.  This means that they will have a gross [income](https://ibb.co/qsbTKCw) of around $37.5B in 2023.  And meanwhile the company is also expected to have some big investments going in 2023 as well, as I made a [projection](https://ibb.co/mXqjr5n) based on past expenses that rounded up to around $9B. They will also have some interest [expenses](https://ibb.co/DzqP6jp) due as the company does still have significant debt but they are working on lowering that as I previously mentioned with new money being raised from time to time by selling stocks.  I will also keep them in the same tax bracket as in the past at a 28% level which gives the company an [income](https://ibb.co/yd6gC03) after tax of almost $20B.  So, guys, at the moment there are over 1.1B shares outstanding of Tesla.  And with my current [projections](https://ibb.co/q1qTDMs) the company would make almost $18 per share in earnings in 2023.  That would mean the stock is trading at 34 times future earnings right now, which compared to the insane current price to earnings [ratio](https://ibb.co/DCPSp0W) which stands at over 1200, that would be amazing. If the stock would trade at 40x forward earnings, which is very low compared to lowest P/E in the last 10 years, that would mean the stock would trade at over 700$ and if you slightly increase that to a 50x future PE the stock would jump to almost 900$  Tesla has been mostly improving its free cash flow to around $1.4B in the last [quarter](https://ibb.co/Q6rq81y), which was only hit at the begging of this year, while also increasing the total amount of operating cash flow.  Here are some of the [highlights](https://ibb.co/bJ6nCMK) that were reported in the latest earnings report.  As the company increased the balance sheet by almost $6B. While the company would have posted an even bigger earnings per share if the stock-based compensations would have been removed, as they accounted for over $540M.  The company reported record vehicle deliveries, profitability and free cash flow while continuing to develop the 3 big factories.  Since the earnings reports they have also started to rollout the Full-Self-Driving feature in more and more cars and kept that promise.  The company has [posted](https://ibb.co/48f0RkN) a beat of earnings expectations in the last quarter, and is expected to see an increase in both revenue and earnings, with the growth expected to continue in the future based on what [analysts](https://ibb.co/SsvpySz) expect to see, as they expect over 50% increases year over year for each of the next 4 quarters.  So, I will give you 3 targets for my bear, normal and bull cases for this company. I [expect](https://ibb.co/0JZt94D) the lowest the stock can reach by 2023 is around 700$ which would give you a rate of return of almost 15% by 2023. While my base case price target for Tesla is around 850$ which would bring you almost 40% returns on the capital invested by 2023. And my bull case for the stock would see the stock valued at over $1K, that would mean an impressive 72% return on investment by 2023.  So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://ibb.co/qYGyxCF) that I have projected for Tesla in 2023, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, with only a couple of big assumptions that they will increase the Energy revenues and the Automotive profit margins slightly.  Keep in mind, this might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Tesla has had in the last 10years. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/t4NsKbD) in value by more 760% in just the past year and is almost 10.000% up in the last 10 years. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company, but are you willing to bet against Elon Musk? Short sellers have been [crushed](https://ibb.co/XYTkdXf) as they continued to bet against him.  Investors, and mostly the young investors in Tesla don‚Äôt think at the old &amp; traditional metrics and valuations, they believe that Musk is the new Steve Jobs so they can‚Äôt get enough of this stock at the moment.   So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Tesla?  Let‚Äôs look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/mBhVLcW). Starting with the stock split, the stock had a pretty big run which ended with a buy the news &amp; sell the event correction in the stock. After that Tesla continued to trade sideways for over 2 months before spiking once again after the news that the company will be included in the SP500.   The company had an impressive run from 408$ to almost 650$ in just 3 weeks, and since that moment the stock has seen some resistance at those high levels especially in the 600-630$ range.   I think we might see a small correction in the stock, to the 550$ levels as this coincides with the 21 EMA, the 21 SMA and the next level of support.  Also, after the SP500 news, the stock was bought on massive volume and was in overbought territory with an RSI over 70, as things have just cooled off a little in the last days with the RSI dropping below overbought territory.  Meanwhile, while expectations have been increasing from retail investors, as they are expecting the stock to always go higher, the latest [news](https://ibb.co/gwj8XKB) that they will have an extended production shutdown after Christmas and maybe also some panic selling if the stock doesn‚Äôt go up on the 18th or 21st, as most retail investors probably expect the stock to go even higher after the SP500 inclusion, may bring Tesla into correction territory.  The spike in stocks after inclusion in index funds has been proven wrong time and time again. Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/Hd9n0yy), which shows that companies between 2008 and 2017 saw a negative 2% average return in the next 20 days after the inclusion despite seeing a huge run before the actual day.   So, what would I do? Well, I owned Tesla stock until about a week ago and sold out at $590 with more than 40% in gains, as I think there will be a slight correction in the stock, and I will get back in the stock after that correction does occur. Remember, I think this stock is going higher in the long-run as my 2023 predictions show, but I did want to take some risk off the table at the moment, as it will be a highly volatile moment for the company. I think there might be a lot of people willing to sell shares on the 18th and 21st, and this might flood the market and drive the price lower, as I think most investors and money managers have already adjusted their portfolios before this [date](https://ibb.co/6W9Y9wD), while a lot of retail investors will be left with stocks that they want to get rid off and fewer and fewer people to buy it.

Lower store base and lower store operating days contributed to same-store sales down 12.7% in the second quarter.  ‚ÄúThe second quarter saw strong progress toward our strategic initiatives, fueling an 800% increase in global e-commerce sales, a $133.7 million reduction in SG&amp;A and a significant improvement in our balance sheet with $735.1 million in cash at quarter-end,‚Äù CEO George Sherman said.  Quarterly losses of $1.40 per share missed the analyst consensus estimate by 37 cents.  # Why It‚Äôs Important: E-commerce growth of 800% year over year was the bright spot in the quarter and represented 20% of total net sales. GameStop was able to see 90% fulfillment rates within 24 hours of customer orders.  # [What does this mean for me?

Looking at their current commitment, future outlook, and general news trends I'm kinda wondering if there's another rally for them before their next earnings or next big investor update.   So here are my thoughts    Current Commitment seems to be heavy on EV, seems like if they were to split of their EV section that alone would be worth a shit ton.   [https://tiresandparts.net/news/general-motors-drives-future-mobility-agenda-at-gitex/](https://tiresandparts.net/news/general-motors-drives-future-mobility-agenda-at-gitex/)  Also, their self-driving is apparently the shit, somehow it beat Tesla? I'm kinda confused so any legit engineers want to give some insights into how that works? Given the rise in  LAZR this is just another segment of GM that should be valued highly yet I think its also being overlooked.  [https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/general-motors-add-super-cruise-gmc-sierra/](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/general-motors-add-super-cruise-gmc-sierra/)  Overall Electric car companies have been on the uptick, but I think a lot of them have hit their high points but GM still has room to grow. They also have enough brands that are distributed well across various price points with their Hummer and Corvette cars being equal in pricing to Teslas high-end vehicles but with multiple brands on lower price points.   On a personal note, I've always been a fan of the Hummer ever since Arnold got an H1 and I think its less of a vehicle to be a mass seller than something to show their capabilities in the EV realm. With testing on the way I think it shows they're not just talking but pulling out the stops.

I'm sitting here with a relatively stagnant portfolio because most of my investments are tied up in FAANG stocks which decided to go full boomer for the last few months. I'm tired of watching Carnival Cruise Line or some airline stock moon 6% every other fucking day while I sit here with my 2% gain on FB since I bought shares about a month ago. I'm going to keep some shares of FAANG stocks, but need to free up a bunch of cash to initiate my YOLO.  I've chosen about 10 stocks that seem like relatively solid plays that are still quite beaten-down from their 52-week highs but are rapidly rising. In order of preference/quantity I am willing to YOLO:  &amp;#x200B;  CCL  AAL  SABR (I actually own 100 shares already, bought at $7.00)  TUI  CNK  BA  DKNG  GE  GM  BOA  &amp;#x200B;  Thoughts on this list?

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let‚Äôs talk about this and everything new in the stock market**  Hey everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.  The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)  The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.  Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter.   The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.  While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.  Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million  Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.  Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.  This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA  [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don‚Äôt just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.  While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don‚Äôt think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.  A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market.   While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand.   Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner‚Äôs decision to send all they‚Äôre 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn‚Äôt doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.  And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave &amp; Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

The grid you‚Äôre currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn‚Äôt it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&amp;E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)  Tesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You‚Äôll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere.   &amp;#x200B;  2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **‚Äì** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you‚Äôll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you‚Äôre really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet.   Since Sun doesn‚Äôt shine at night, and sometimes it‚Äôs cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla‚Äôs supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla‚Äôs battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&amp;E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla‚Äôs Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man.   &amp;#x200B;  3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage ‚Äì** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you‚Äôll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn‚Äôt buy a house that doesn‚Äôt have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future.   4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs ‚Äì** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It‚Äôs really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it‚Äôs up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist.   &amp;#x200B;  The solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who‚Äôd be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that‚Äôs that. Tesla will dominate this market which they‚Äôre building from scratch.   &amp;#x200B;  **5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that‚Äôs the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it‚Äôs laughable generally to even think something like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna make our own business software‚Äù. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don‚Äôt tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )           **6)** **Selling Insurance Products ‚Äì** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance ‚Äúan auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business‚Äù. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you‚Äôre a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They‚Äôre currently offering it in California only.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines ‚Äì** As per Elon, he doesn‚Äôt expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they‚Äôre developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it‚Äôs a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They‚Äôve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn‚Äôt know anything about vaccines? Well, he‚Äôs an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac ‚Äì a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.           **8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles ‚Äì** Oh no‚Ä¶Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren‚Äôt people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they‚Äôre building. Don‚Äôt tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;)   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories ‚Äì** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn‚Äôt exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you‚Äôve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla‚Äôs long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn‚Äôt Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won‚Äôt have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?           **10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) ‚Äì** So we‚Äôre talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you‚Äôre fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla‚Äôs in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn‚Äôt been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with ‚Äúbetter chip‚Äù next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla‚Äôs range doesn‚Äôt just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let‚Äôs not even talk about compute  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- ""Tesla Dojo""** **-** So this is something the industry hadn‚Äôt even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.           **12)**  **Mine lithium ‚Äì** Hold your horses, it‚Äôs getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they‚Äôve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they‚Äôll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they‚Äôll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage.   &amp;#x200B;  **13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries ‚Äì** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They‚Äôre going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won‚Äôt be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla‚Äôs cells are going to be the industry leading. They won‚Äôt be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.  **The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1645563|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/X6xgpy6c6_p83EPFTotP-e4L6429JgJWjDg6PNyK0MY.jpg|118.0|140.0|Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5axun/tesla_for_dummies_and_5_year_olds/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'L_befk8IPVwDg3Gsy3OE9igWe-lNO11NwbQxQhsacm4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcb6987fdcf6ab4b094385c7d327be9442abe76', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac2201002117eff4cf5114a0a3b8befcee77f3fc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc496b936c57795a6e8e2f1559095725564576d1', 'width': 320}, {'height': 335, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c8acb4f7cf034fb289dc7fa12129c4e4bc0d1c', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d7d1d30df70508aedfb4a13f9a93c4761233ae2', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 550, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QjyGDHZV6jfirLe4H4VLUSuKMoyTLlp5BSRfpwwsib8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=dc640b4e8015df97f0d279528dbe9f1bf606ab97', 'width': 1050}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-12-02|GM

So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.  Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)  The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)  Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.  While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.  This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.  Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.  On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.  The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.  Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.  We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.  While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.  But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.  The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don‚Äôt disappoint.  I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

VALE, however, has been solidly rising every single day.  I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.  Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Positions: VALE 18c 03/2021"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1641057|public|confidence|self|||VALE is the next EV Hype Train|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ns7b/vale_is_the_next_ev_hype_train/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-12-01|GM

So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.  Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)  Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.  Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company‚Äôs future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)  Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it‚Äôs GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.  Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it‚Äôs shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.  Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.  While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it‚Äôs share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock‚Ä¶ So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.  Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.  Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe‚Äôs, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.  While on the vaccine front, Moderna‚Äôs candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it‚Äôs head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they‚Äôre first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.  The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.  Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn‚Äôt gone to far to the left.  So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviously‚Ä¶ For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.‚ÄùCoster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](http://www.shippipedia.com/nikola-stock-will-surge-70-from-current-levels-says-analyst/) Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41.   Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.  2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/kTSmcxW) that I find it surprising that he has almost came to [3 stars.](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster)  Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesn‚Äôt give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.  I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.  There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I don‚Äôt know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock.   Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market(see PLTR price targets, it‚Äôs hilarious). But we all know that this company's stock is ultimately going to $0(probably within next year).  Disclaimer: I am short NKLA, have Dec 11 $20 puts, long PLTR shares(so I have my bias too)."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1639844|public|confidence|self|||How some analysts try to f**k you and why you should always verify their track records- analysing Paul Coster, J.P.

The real move right now is investing in hydrogen fuel cell companies. These companies manufacture hydrogen fuel cells which can be used for automobiles, and other engineering services.   &amp;#x200B;  With FCEL up 300% since last month and BLDP up 30% since last month, both stocks are a great way to gain exposure to this alternative renewable energy available for future automobiles. GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, and many other car manufactures are looking into this potential energy source...   Link to Toyota Mirai a hydrogen fuel cell powered automobile: [https://www.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html](https://www.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html)  Link to Honda Clarity a hydrogen fuel cell powered automobile: [https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell](https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell)   Even Germany is upgrading its public transportation to use these fuel cells: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/17/germany-launches-worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-train](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/17/germany-launches-worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-train)  &amp;#x200B;  I'm surprised that this isn't getting more discussion and even more news presence.  Hydrogen fuel cells have barely taken off, have much more room to moon, and are already accelerating upward at a fast pace. THESE STOCKS ARE UP ALMOST 350% COLLECTIVELY THE PAST MONTH AND CAN EASILY TRIPLE OR MORE AGAIN BY FEBRUARY !!!  &amp;#x200B;  I'm currently trading BLDP options with a jan 2022 exp and $20 strike which have doubled since I bought last month and also FCEL options with a jan 2022 exp and a $5.5 strike which have tripled since I purchased a few months ago.  JUST PURCHASED SHORTER TERM OPTIONS TODAY BASED ON THE GROWTH OUTLOOK AND INVESTMENT OF BIG BANKS JP AND CITI!  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR; HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS WILL PROVIDE MASSIVE TENDIES TO ALL! THIS MARKET IS NOT BEING REPORTED OR INVESTED IN AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE! IT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND LITTLE HYPE RIGHT NOW BUT IS STARTING TO GAIN STEAM.

Why is this?   Well, after the financial crisis of 08-09, the government took control of a few companies including GM, Chrysler, AIG, Merrill, Countrywide and some others.  Each of these were either sold off to more solvent company (Merrill, Countrywide, Cheysler) or eventually were resold to the public through a new IPO (GM).  Except Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).  Instead of reselling them to the public, the government kept them captive and stole their lunch money for twelve years.  How much money?  $380,000,000,000  Yes. Almost enough to buy TSLA outright.  As you might imagine, the owners of FNMA and FMCC were a bit pissed about being robbed by the government to that extent, so they sued.  These things take years to wind their way through the court system, but it just happens that this case hits December 9.  While we can‚Äôt know the outcome of the case, there are things we do know.  1. The listed defendant is Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. This means he can settle this out of court anyway he wants. 2. With the new 6-3 conservative majority on the court, they may not be too sympathetic to an argument the government can steal $300 billion from you. 3. FNMA has $60 billion in the bank now 4. FNMA makes 10-15 billion in profits per year 5. The entire market cap of FNMA is $3 billion   For those wondering, there are no options on FNMA, but at a share price of $2.65, a share of FNMA or FMCC IS AN OPTION.  Note: if this doesn‚Äôt settle by the time Trump leaves office Biden will scuttle it if he can because democrats love that pot of free money.

Exro is a clean tech company that has developed a new class of controller that dynamically enables multiple power settings in a single motor making it faster, stronger, and smarter. Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology.  Exro combines its patented software and hardware with in-house design, development testing, and final assembly at its Calgary Innovation Center for the most cost-effective solutions.  Exro is putting the intelligence into energy management and seeks to accelerate the global transition to clean energy.  I will summarize what I know and what I have learned from my investigation  1. As per CEO, their Projections are: Revenue should start from end of 2021. EBITDA +ve from 2023 2. Business model -&gt; If its a low volume high value, they said they could manufacture themselves. If its volume business , they will either engage Contract manufacture it or do a licensing deal with OEMs who take care of manufacturing. Most business will be done in the license model 3. MOAT : They hold patents in different regions. They claim, each customer's work will be customized design for the customer and since their main work is software, they believe it will take years for someone to reverse engineer it. 4. Competitors - CEO claims no competition. The problem statement is widely known. My personal investigation till date suggest that there is/are other competitor(s) around, but they have their own solution. Question is, who has best efficiency &amp; range and can they start commercializing it soon.  There are many ways seen to solve the problem :  i) Motor companies who use expensive Permanent magnet motors (made of rare earth metals). These are expensive but performance is great  ii) Semiconductor technology: Silicon-Mobility a French private startup, are working on same problem. Their's solution is based on similar, software tech but this thro semiconductors...Exro is micro controller but directly on the motor. Silicon-Mobility claim is they can better performance &amp; torque by 10-30%. Exro is also same or more. Silicon-Mobility do have couple of good partners (Valeo a auto ancillary and AVL autotech company).But IMO, they are a bit behind in commercialisation, atleast from what I know. It will be one to watch out for in future...if they ever go public.  End of the day, the electrification and solving the Differential Torque problem in Electric Car wont be solved alone by 1 company for entire world.  Exro has sooooooo many use cases and opportunity size is huge.  Their current plan is to use these prototype partnerships and get the test benchmark data. Say suppose Potencia testing gives benchmark data for electric car (converted from ICE by Potencia) and a electric Van. The data they get out of this testing will then be used and benchmarked against commercially available electric car data. If Exro finds enough proof that their tech is better, then they can go to the bigger OEMs like GM or Ford or whoever and get seat at the table.  If Potencia works, then Exro's target IMO should be likes of GM &amp; Ford who want to do the volume business. They also have several partners listed on their site here: [https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/](https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/)  Finally, Haywood Securities covered them recently, and you can find the 20+ page report here, with a price target of $6.00 CAD.

So, after being down a 7k and down to my last grand, I think the play that will shoot me back up to the moon is NKLA Dec 20 10 put @ .15. I can buy 50 puts and have enough cash left over to hopefully build up my account responsibly if this goes tits up. So, the recent run up of Nikola price can be attributed to hope around the GM deal being possible still, but I think people have to come to terms that its not happening. On November 9th on the Nikola website was still linked to the gm deal, but on Nov 11 it was changed and removed any sign of it and the badger. This can lead to a one likely outcome, the deal is done for, with Nikola not wanting to pursue the badger and instead focus on its core business or that GM wants too much from Nikola. With a deal not done by Dec 3rd either company can walk away. I think the probability of this is quite high. On top of this the lockup period for early investors will unlock and there are no assurances from Trevor Milton wont sell his shares, sure a couple of insider have extended there lockup period , but with the possibility come dec 1st that a large amount of insiders will have the ability to possibly dump over 100million shares thats scary and the price will reflect that in a huge drop. If I was an insider and knew there were credible allegations against the company and under investigation by the SEC and DOJ, id'd be nervous as a buyer. #NIKOLAto$5ifiprayhardenough.

But I just know there is some bleary eyed idiot from Stocks and Investing here that is like I just CANT bring myself to take these kind of risks, look how expensive the market is!!!  Even though the market is at all time highs, and basically the market has been trading flat other than yesterday, there is crazy volatility underneath the surface. For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**  But boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**  So what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.  Curve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.  I don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July? Shut up.

  First, I‚Äôd like to premise with my understanding that General Motors has a terrible track record when it comes to EVs. In fact, their EV1 (the first mass produced electric vehicle) took a colossal shit in the 90s- leading to the recall and destruction of nearly all leased cars. Even looking at present day, current offerings are also shit; the volt is disturbingly ugly and costs too much, and the bolt looks like a premature avocado. That said, I see a bright future for $GM in the coming months.  **$GM vs $TSLA for the consumer EV**  Tesla (TSLA) obviously has the predominant market share of US EV market, but GM is well equipped to take over a significant portion of the Chinese market. Elon constantly talks of a $25k Tesla for the ‚Äúpoors‚Äù, but the three-year timeline for this is uncertain. Hongguang Mini, made by a GM joint venture, costs just $4,300 and is currently the bestselling EV in China (surpassing the M3). While something this small most likely wouldn‚Äôt succeed in US or Canadian markets, there is a large opportunity within Asian and European markets. GM (thus far) has predominant market share in the entry level EVs.   &amp;#x200B;  [$4,300!](https://preview.redd.it/6kdoyll86n061.jpg?width=2500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5533bc905b40d7f4bc67ddec715bb8cd2d2fe634)  **$GM ups spending on EVs and autonomous cars by 35% to $27 billion**  &amp;#x200B;  * GM will spend $27 billion on all-electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, an increase of $7 billion, from initial plans announced in March. * The increase in investment will support GM‚Äôs plans to release 30 new EVs globally by 2025, including more than 20 for North America. * GM said it has moved up the release of 12 EVs, including pickups for its Chevrolet and GMC brands.  Comparing Tesla and General Motor‚Äôs R&amp;D costs, GM spent about $7.8 billion on research and development in 2018, an amount that was again 5X more than Tesla‚Äôs R&amp;D spending of $1.5 billion during the same year. That said, Tesla is obviously the leader in this EV market. So how will this 35% increase put GM ahead?  https://preview.redd.it/kwfxcdw36n061.jpg?width=639&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fb1dbcdd91bb0740f04a0afc8db242250672c16  As seen from the chart, from 2013 to 2015, Tesla‚Äôs R&amp;D spending ratio rose quickly from 11% to 18% revenue whereas GM‚Äôs R&amp;D spending ratio has more or less stayed in the same range at 5% during the same period. However, the gap of R&amp;D ratio between Tesla and GM were closing in in 2019 at 5% when Tesla‚Äôs figure was seen de-accelerating since 2016 and reached the lowest at 5% revenue in 2019.  While Tesla‚Äôs R&amp;D budget growth rate turned negative in 2019, the average figure was still around 40% for the past 7 years which is much better than GM‚Äôs average R&amp;D expenses growth rate of -1% over the same period.  In other words, GM‚Äôs R&amp;D expenses have roughly stayed in the same level in average from 2013 to 2019. This increase in spending will be help GM reach its new goal of launching 30 new EVs 2025. This is a significant increase from the previously stated 22 vehicles.   This increased spending will also go towards the second generation of its uItium battery when it is released in 2025. This battery will be 60% cheaper than the Chevrolet Bolt battery, while doubling the expected energy density. Furthermore, GM has partnered with LG to manufacture the ultium battery at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which opens in the first quarter of 2021 and will have a capacity for 30 GWh/yr. On the contrary, battery production at Gigafactory 1 reached an annualized rate of roughly 20 GWh in 2018.  **Technicals**  *I‚Äôll be honest, I know nothing about fundamentals, P/E ratios, or even what the greeks mean. I haven‚Äôt taken a single economics finance course in college- I study rhetoric. However, I do my research and take buying opportunities when I see them. I‚Äôll refer to Deutsche Bank and their 12% increased price target on Friday.*   ""We are very encouraged by GM's updated product and investment strategy and targeted cost/margin trajectory, which could ultimately give it a strong market position and solid profitability in EVs‚Äù.  https://preview.redd.it/tmv0umad6n061.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=057ebfb940124c31343ab6dc557af6870f3024af  From a price perspective, GM hasn‚Äôt moved above its October 2017 all-time high and has only just moved beyond its earlier peak in December 2013. In respect to EV stocks, GM‚Äôs trading volume is still relatively low @ 16M Friday. Comparing $NIO @ 209M, $TSLA @ 32M, and shit $NKLA @ 18M - retails investors have yet to consider $GM in this EV race. Once volume and media news increases, I can see volume and price increasing easily.   **Design**  From the examples seen thus far, General Motors is not fucking around when it comes to design. Take the recent C8 for example: The C8 is using the same type of materials as the C7 (aluminum frame, plastic and carbon body), manufacturing techniques, and the same types of engine components that they already have. Yes, a mid-engine car is theoretically better, but design innovations have been at the center of discussion within the industry.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/xy0g2lsb6n061.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09e7612e01b548e221dbfd240b3551efdde33984  The Hummer Ev and Cadillac Lyric look fantastic, and will provide luxury consumers the ability to choose something other than a Tesla, Audi e-tron, or EQC in the coming years.

The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all).   So what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025.   So Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.  Invest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!

Look at the dot com bubble it was sound logic to assume that the internet was going to evolve the world. It is sound logic to assume that evs will take over the car industry so does its current valuation justify its place in the future.    Toyota: 231B                                     Tesla: 465 B   Fiat Chrysler: 20 B   Ford: 24 B   Ferrari: 32 B   GM: 36 B   Honda: 46 B   Volkswagen: 74B   Total: 463 B                                     Total :465 B   I fully believe that tesla will be the top dog in the EV industry. But to justify this valuation you would have to believe tesla is gonna sell almost every new car in the next ten years. Telsa sells only a 318,000 to 10.7 m that Toyota sells.  Where are these sky high evaluations coming from if not for a bubble? This isnt even looking at other ev companies if we consider NKLA, NIO, Fisker, or solo. NKLA is the most damning that you dont even have to sell a single EV to get billions in valuation for a ev company. How does this not scream Dot com bubble to anyone?

FSR is using the Apple business model for bringing their first suv to market. Magma (ie their Foxconn) will be responsible for the manufacturing of the vehicle using existing facilities already in place (ie if there is a problem manufacturing, it‚Äôs not their problem or financial responsibility to fix it, it‚Äôs theirs.) Tesla has had several issues throughout the years trying to manage their own manufacturing. FSR won‚Äôt have this problem.  Once the Ocean is out on the market, other models that Henrik is designing now will be able to put on the market in months, not years like manufacturers take to bring something to market. So that means a lifestyle pickup, sedan, or whatever the hell Henrik thinks will sell and get people excited.   The leasing plans favor Fisker financially. Customers can return the Ocean at any time. The down payment and cheap oem parts will help put the suv back out on the market where the next customer will put another down payment towards the slightly used vehicle. Every time Fisker sells a lease to a customer they get that down payment that secures their financial upside instead of a dealer that would take commission. The Ocean is ripe to be a profit machine so Fisker can then go on to develop more exciting vehicles.   The Ocean will be in US and Europe in Q4 2022. China(!) will start getting it shortly after in 2023 using existing manufacturing plants in China already owned by Magna. This is a stupid simple play to be everywhere by 2024.   FSR already has the money to put the first vehicle on the market without taking an offering from stock (no surprise offerings needed so you don‚Äôt have to worry about the stock suddenly tanking due to investor fear of a sell off.) It would take a massive run on this stock before some stupid analyst would say it‚Äôs overvalued for the stock to actually fall to a realistic valuation. Right now it‚Äôs completed undervalued.   FSR is at sub 17 dollars right now with a sub 5billion market cap while NKLA has a fake partnership with GM, no solid plans to bring a vehicle to market and you retards value it at like 10 billion. First price target was 22 and second high price target is 40.   tldr FSR 22.5C 12/18 and buy this stock before MM finally figure out how much this is actually worth.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1596655|public|confidence|self|||You are missing out on FSR|0.0|[]|0.88|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwl85o/you_are_missing_out_on_fsr/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-11-18|GM

That underscores that local Chinese demand is far below production capacity.

But Tesla trailed the GM-SAIC Wuling joint venture, Warren Buffett-backed BYD and another SAIC unit. Tesla also exported about 10,000 made-in-China Model 3 cars to other countries, after saying it would start exports to European markets on Oct. 20.    TSLA is also lowering its goals and promises in the US, cutting out the $35K Model 3, which has a history of over-promising and under delivering. It was promised in 2017, finally arrived in 2019 and is already being cut from the lineup. This is from a company with such deep pockets due to over-capitalization from its loving retail investor base that it's worth more than the Saudi family's collection of London flats.   * [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/)  &gt; The really cheapest Model 3 only lived for a few months, and Tesla sold a workaround option after that -- but not anymore... Electrek reported Monday, citing unnamed sources, that it's no longer possible to order the entry-level Model 3. Though, if we're being totally factual, the actual $35,000 Model 3 went away a long time ago.  **Pressured by NIO**  Chinese EVs are now gaining on TSLA, as well. According to its earnings report last night, NIO delivered 5K cars in October to TSLA's 12K cars, and unlike TSLA, there's demand that supports its production. There is strong demand for its cars.  * [NIO Inc. Reports Unaudited Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/17/2128703/0/en/NIO-Inc-Reports-Unaudited-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html)  * [NIO Inc. (NIO) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/11/nio-inc-nio-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)  &gt; Starting from October 2019, ES6 has ranked as the top-selling SUV across all EV sectors in China. For the first half of this year, ES8 has also achieved No. 1 in sales among mid- to large-sized luxury electric SUVs priced above RMB 400,000 in China.  **Nowhere to go but down**  Being added to the S&amp;P 500 isn't a great thing for TSLA (or the S&amp;P 500). They both have the same problem: inflated values with nowhere to go but down if the gov stops propping up stocks with new injections of money, fed buying and/or fiscal stimulus. If anything TSLA was a relatively safe haven from volatility as its unrealistically loyal retail customer base was supporting it at a more stable level than the indexed companies have been at, as indexed companies do go up and down as passive investors put money into index funds and pull money out. Make no mistake, this is why S&amp;P Global finally added TSLA to the index.   **ChEVs solid growth story, analyst ratings**  Analysts agree with the ChEV ""bubble"" more than they agree with the TSLA ""bubble"".. because the ChEV's aren't in a bubble. They are growing at a fantastic rate. They are all currently trading under their most recent price targets and so are values.  * [Li's price target was raised to $45.60 by Citigroup on 11/16/2020](https://www.barrons.com/articles/li-auto-stock-is-upgraded-xpeng-target-is-raised-its-the-wild-west-on-ev-ratings-51605541204).

It's currently rated a buy (or better).  * [Did Credit Suisse just raise NIO's price target to $60 overnight?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/jwctqg/price_target_60_credit_susse/)   Did Credit Suisse raise NIO's price target overnight? Who knows, we need confirmation of this SS. But what is clear is that analysts project its price target to be $150 if it exported to Europe &amp; the US, as NIO is moving to do  * [Strong International Expansion to Drive NIO Stock to $150](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/strong-international-expansion-to-drive-nio-stock-to-150/)  &gt; The key to NIO stock unlocking big returns from here lies in the company's ability to replicate its success all across the globe... To-date, no one has really talked about NIO‚Äôs ability to expand internationally, and potentially replicate its China success at a global scale.    &gt; My previous modeling ‚Äî which assumed NIO dominated the premium electric vehicle market in China alone ‚Äî produced a long-term price target for NIO stock of $60. But, after accounting for international expansion opportunities and assuming NIO does fairly well in non-China premium EV markets, my modeling now produces a long-term price target for NIO stock all the way up at $150.  **When it comes to interpreting trading action of a ChEV stock, you have to follow the basket**  US investors get too distracted by the daily trading moves of one out of a basket of ChEV stocks, making them prime suckers for smart options traders. ChEV investors who are really investing in this sector have a basket of stocks that they focus on, and the daily price moves of any one stock like NIO don't mean jack to us. While you all were being distracted by NIO's potential for spiking up and down on an earnings report and are drawing wild conclusions about it being relatively flat afterward, this is was I was focused on yesterday and the day before:  * [KNDI up &gt; 50% in the past few days](https://finviz.com/publish/111820/KNDIc0dl0806.png)    NIO already got its price bump from earnings week at the same time XPEV, LI &amp; NIO all rocketed up last week. All you're seeing this week is tail action... while ChEV investors are following KNDI.  You can't focus on just one ChEV stock if you want to understand how any particular ChEV is trading.   Here's my current basket:  * XPEV   * NIO   * LI   * NIU   * KNDI   * CBAT  And also check out CBAT's crazy üöÄ in the past few days as well.   Because most US investors get misled by not following the ChEV stocks the way they should be followed, WSB can make money off their mistakes and misreadings.   Also, you may want to stop obsessing over TSLA, because IMO the obvious crazy money left to be made of TSLA is by ppl who get their puts in early instead of riding that stock down. Is it even better than a HOLD right now?  Literally the only pro wiling to go out on a limb and neg the ChEVs are the hack who shorts stuff using hack analysis, Andrew Flake, who is an actual real world cuck whose wife's boyfriend is a ChEV investor.

Tesla has the best battery technology, best cars, tons of other revenue sources, best scientists working for them, Elon Musk, the 2nd best self driving technology out there, and a huge headstart in the EV market around the world.  They are consistently smashing through records with their sales and revenue, and coming out with tons of new inventions to help revolutionize multiple industries.  They're not JUST cars, they have batteries, solar panels, Starlink, and so much more.  As of right now, they also have basically a monopoly on the NA EV market, and a massive lead in the Chinese EV market as well, and a top seller in the EU EV market as well.  Nio is none of this.  Nio was nearly bankrupt a year ago, and only survived because they managed to get a 1.4 billion dollar bailout.  As of right now, Nio has 1.5 billion dollars in short and long-term debt and lease operating liabilities.  Nio's trailing 12 months revenue has been 1.4 billion.  This is completely in line with most car companies.  Ford has 175 billion in debt and 156 billion in yearly revenue.  GM's ratio is slightly better than both with 120 Billion-ish in revenue and 96 billion in debt.  GM and Tesla will be the main comparison here, because GM is massive, and Tesla is the direct competitor.    Tesla has 14billion in debt and 25 billion in revenue.  Which is much better than most, and their typically fund this by selling their disgustingly overvalued stock, which, ultimately helps them out a ton in the long run, as its essentially free money and people buy the dip literally everytime.  It should also be noted, even though Nio has more debt than it does revenue over 12 months, its also has never broken a profit.  It still consistently losses tons of money.  They have tons of debt, and still are losing TONS of money.  They also don't have any of the amazing things going for them like Tesla. They sell cars, they are a car company.  Nio has DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH TESLA.  Tesla is IN CHINA.  There's also plenty of options to buy electric cars in China right now as well.   Nio is NOT in America.  You cannot go to a Nio dealership and buy one in America.  Nio has barely any revenue, in a brutal and oversaturated market, tons of debt, nearly went bankrupt, and MORE THAN LIKELY WILL EVENTUALLY GO BANKRUPT AGAIN, they're losing tons of money, and not only competing with all of the major car companies in China, BUT THEYRE ALSO COMPETING WITH TESLA, DIRECTLY.  Nio also currently has 2 vehicles for sale..both of which are SUV's costing 70k+.  Sure, they MIGHT pull a Tesla, but odds are, they wont.  And even if they happen to start showing massive growth, THERE IS NO MORE ROOM FOR IT TO GROW IN STOCK PRICE.  They are worth more than GM, and worth 1/5th of tesla despite having 1/25th their revenue, a MUCH worse debt to revenue ratio, TESLA MAKES PROFIT QUITE OFTEN, and Tesla has alot of other potentially MASSIVE catalysts.  Tesla is struggling for world dominance.  Nio is struggling to not go bankrupt.  Nio is worth more than GM despite GM making 3 billion PROFIT a year.  Nio losses tens of millions of dollars a year, and has 1/120th their revenue and they are bigger than GM.  I am 100% certain Nio will not get anywhere close to GM.  Tesla, will eventually become on par with all of them, HENCE THEIR MASSIVE VALUATION.  Nio isn't the Tesla of China because TESLA IS THE TESLA OF CHINA.  The best-case scenario for Nio, is another year of large growth, a peak, then constant decline due to tons of competition and they get bought out by a large car company trying to get their way into China.  Most likely, given their insane valuation, is they're gonna have lots of hit and miss quarters, as more competitors flood the market, Nio will eventually no longer be able to stay in business because every major car maker in the world plans to have an electric car or 3 next year, and Nio will not have made it in time to have a massive market cap.  They will probably be a niche luxory car maker if they're lucky, but ultimately due to their debt and awful growth, it'll be bankruptcy within a few years.  TLDR: Buy Tesla, Not Nio.  Nio isnt the Tesla of China, Tesla is the Tesla of China.  Also, while I did manage to miss the meteoric Nio rise for the most part, I have not owned Puts until Today.  I will be buying puts for various dates, and I think next week's ER is priced in so Puts for next Friday, and mid next year.  20/11/2020 - 47$ Puts  19/05/2020 - 47$ Puts|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1589720|public|confidence|self|||Nio is way more overvalued then Tesla|0.0|[]|0.31|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtigca/nio_is_way_more_overvalued_then_tesla/|no_ads|0|||||1605284078.0|||||||||2020-11-13|GM

Slowly  Had some SPY puts this week so we‚Äôre taking our tour of the wreckage around Boomerland in a [Lamborghini Miura P400](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Lamborghini_miura_coup%C3%A9_1967_-aa.jpg/1200px-Lamborghini_miura_coup%C3%A9_1967_-aa.jpg). Tuck them sacks and buckle them balls because I don‚Äôt know how to drive a stick.   GE beat earnings expectations and actually *made* money ($0.06 EPS vs expected -$0.04). Not many saw that coming so the inhabitants of Boomerland popped a few Viagras and started humping the buy button until it shot up on a swing of more than +9% early Wednesday morning from -4.76% to +4.42% before giving up all the week‚Äôs gains in the last two hours of trading. Popped back up in time for open on Thursday but promptly got tired and fell asleep. Finished the week down -0.7%.   XOMMY XOMMY XOM XOM. In a remarkably rational footnote to this confounding covid market, the ground-pounding for a company that relies on things and people being moved. Down -3.5% on the week and a staggering -21% on the 3-month chart.   What‚Äôs the mpg on my Lambo, you ask? 14.9 mpg thank you very much; not bad for the era.  IBM, which did a *very* IBM-like thing on the 19th and hit ER expectations on the nose at $2.58 EPS, had an interesting week. International Business Machines‚Äô stock price melted to a low of -7.26% on Wednesday before making a steady climb back up to just -2.4% on the week. Solid showing on Friday; +2.6% on the day.   UL, the world‚Äôs favorite Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, positively shat the bed this week with a loose, bloody stool. For a company that‚Äôs been pretty damn rangebound, this week‚Äôs -6.24% slide is a stark reminder to hide both your bonds and your dividends because they‚Äôre raping everybody.   Likewise, KO - champions in antiquity of liquid-induced diabetes, also had an unfortunate and smelly accident in the marketplace this week. Down -4.20% on the week to $48.07 per share. Ouch. It took *forever* to get to $50 and fought its balls off to stay above that. Not a good look.  This is getting depressing so let‚Äôs do an uplifting one. How about BA? They‚Äôre always good for a laugh. Ah, yes; they appear to have died. Down to -12.2% on the week. Whoops.  Could the banking industry perhaps pull us out of this dreadful malaise? Fuck no; sector down 3-4%ish.  HON (Honeywell)? They beat expectations! Down 4.76% on the week.   Ford? Red.  GM? Red.  PFE. Surely the company on whose shoulders rest the entire world‚Äôs hope for a return to normalcy can provide us with a dose of the green stuff. Down -6.8% on the week. Bwoooooooah fuck that‚Äôs PFE we‚Äôre talking about here.  Very fucking depressing.   Welp, I guess that‚Äôs all for this this week‚Äôs tour of Boomerland for the week ending October 30th, 2020.

Slowly.  This week we‚Äôre taking our tour of Boomerland in a [Subaru Sumo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Libero.jpg), the 4 wheel drive microvan you never knew that you needed. Buckle up your ball sacks and let‚Äôs get this show on the road.  GE, who has been generally electric the past few weeks, got off to a rocky start on Monday but recovered a bit to stay flat Tuesday and Wednesday. News leaked to Bloomberg about a possible sale of its controlling stake in a Wuhan something something company and the price climbed to +7% on the week at open on Friday before giving some of it back to close out at +3.9%. It‚Äôs been a pretty damn good month for GE stock; up 19%.  XOM XOMMY XOM XOM had a wild week. Down -3% by EOD Wednesday. Shot up to +2% on a +5% swing by EOD Thursday. Had a bad Friday and gave up 2.5% to end the week down 0.03% to $34.19 ish per share. Oh, you want to know the resultant price change for the week? That‚Äôd be -$0.0100 per share.   KO, practitioner of the syrupy arts, remains mostly rangebound at the $50/share level. It dipped slightly below that by EOD Monday but had a solid week and closed it out +1.13% to $50.60 per share.  UL (Unilever), fell from the ATH it set last week. Pretty ugly performance except Tuesday. Clocked a -2.3% for the week to $61.32 per share.  X (US Steel) - the worst performing stock of a company that‚Äôs still in business - did X things through Wednesday as it closed the trading day down 1.4% for the week. Then, Thursday and Friday happened and it closed the week out +10.5% to a neat $10.00 per share. Why the jump? I have no idea but probably commodity price things? They‚Äôre expected to report earnings of equal to a *loss* of $1.45/s next week.   BA, who has had some wild price action recently, had a bit of a quieter week although Thursday brought a 3% ish swing to the positive. Notched a -1.04% loss for the week though.  INTC. Another post- earnings report bloodbath. -11.7% to $48.13 per share for the week. Gg. Not quite at its March 52-week low of $43.63 but a lot closer to that than its 52 week high of $69.29.   We wrap up our tour with GM, who generally motored its way to a phenomenal +9.64% for the week to $36.86. Are we going to say that the pop was due to announcing plans to release an EV Hummer in late 2021? Timeline matches up so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going with. Up 25% for the month.   Thanks for coming along on our tour through Boomerland for the week ending October 23rd, 2020. It certainly had variety.

Papa Elon is bringing a market revolution with his vehicles. He has finally proved he can continue to grow production and manage costs.   That being said, we still live in the ICE age. That shit isn't going to melt for another decade. Let's talk about Covid and market trends. People aren't using public transportation. The housing market is still stable. GM just got upgraded. People are buying more cars than they have in a while. A rising tide lifts all boats.  Jim Hackett has been CEO of F and sucked. Ford is burdened with debt like my wife's boyfriend had a breeding fetish and knocked her up. Ford's stock has been beaten down greatly. But that is why it is such a great buy right now where Ford has finally started to turn things around by focusing on the F150. The F150 is the only reason they are still around today.  By focusing on their only decent product and switching leadership they can get back to the level of mediocrity we all expect.   Look at the stock technicals. The stock finally had its golden cross this year. Other than that it has been pretty mediocre with no amazing news. This puts it in a position where there is plenty of upside. I think the slow upward trend will change with their next earnings call. People are overly hyped on electric. With the Mustang Mach-E on the way and an earnings beat, you're gonna see a sizeable bump.  I'm dumping my stock and calls pretty much after earnings. The company will end up in the dumpster after this final flame.  Do I think this is definitely right? No but I like to gamble and this is one of the best opportunities I've been able to find after SNAP. Just sold my 2 27.5c 11/27 this morning for a 5x gain.

I mostly buy stocks, specifically looking at IPOs, M&amp;A targets, and high growth companies. 90% of my portfolio is in stocks with the other 10% in option plays. (https://imgur.com/FcSPC94)  I'll place small bets on risky options plays, but never yolo big into any one bet. Right now have options plays in NKLA, GM, BLL, XOM, FIT, PSTH, and OZK. All calls except for OZK. The gains potential is much higher for calls vs puts, so if I'm going to make a high risk bet, I at least want the gains to be worthwhile.  When an options play turns out well, I rebalance into some more stocks to generally maintain the 9 to 1 ratio.  For stocks, I use stop market orders to prevent huge losses when the market tanks or bad news spreads. Depending on the stock volatility, I'll set the stop market trigger just below my cost basis or 90% of the stock price. That dip in March was me basically liquidating my whole portfolio, and sitting out for a couple weeks.

Teslas gonna have to start selling rockets to consumers to compete with GM.  https://www.gm.com/electric-vehicles.html#:~:text=General%20Motors%20recently%20unveiled%20the,Motors%2C%20Cruise%20and%20Honda%20partnership.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1539920|public|confidence|self|||OK you TSLA cucks big boy gov bailout GM is in town|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7pov1/ok_you_tsla_cucks_big_boy_gov_bailout_gm_is_in/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'kMed4yxQ6_8MJy0nuUTShhqt6XEvjJJAvy_7jSuLlLI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 61, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/aX-J40tytr2FnKJRpWaaPUVC5utLL-BXqymVvGFJX-w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a38fb4a528109822c77c5df2a5aa4495d87c09', 'width': 108}, {'height': 123, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/aX-J40tytr2FnKJRpWaaPUVC5utLL-BXqymVvGFJX-w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ba029fdd562489bb32e9f072de51892a80cab3', 'width': 216}, {'height': 183, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/aX-J40tytr2FnKJRpWaaPUVC5utLL-BXqymVvGFJX-w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1a6cfcf4d28ca6b1d1bc47cb0feb611a9da9d9', 'width': 320}, {'height': 366, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/aX-J40tytr2FnKJRpWaaPUVC5utLL-BXqymVvGFJX-w.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4c5f79e5e94c4493c40ecf1f696ba6d6e491d19', 'width': 640}, {'height': 549, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/aX-J40tytr2FnKJRpWaaPUVC5utLL-BXqymVvGFJX-w.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea53e182be740c715922e41a50614e6e88d9eb9d', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 556, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/aX-J40tytr2FnKJRpWaaPUVC5utLL-BXqymVvGFJX-w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e2bca8791c6b7525aa59b7f7d4bf46d65d9da194', 'width': 972}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-10-09|GM

Slowly.*  Fasten the seatbelt over your sweaty floopa and let‚Äôs get this party started.  We kick it off with the stock that we were all thinking about this week: CSCO. Thoughts and prayers went out but they weren‚Äôt enough; she dead. It barely caught the wave up and most definitely caught the wave down. Shaved -2% more off its share price to come in at a raggedy 38.85ish. This former star child of the Boomerfolio has melted -16.7% on the 3 month chart.   Next up is BA, who had its much heralded FAA test flight. No crashes, which is what you really want see in a test like that. The stock price, meanwhile, was more jittery than a possessed crackhead in church and ended up nearly +5% for the week.   GM, who famously tested electric vehicles in 1805 but decided it was just a meme, swung over 6% this week from a low of -3% on Tuesday to +3.5%ish at close on Friday.  PFE lost a whopping 0.01% on Friday to close out a solid week that saw the stock jump +2.3%.  KO, who last week gave up 50/s last week, failed to reclaim it but posted a solid +2.4%ish gain for the week to 49.38ish.   Gotdamn airlines appear to be successfully extorting the government for bailout money after years of spending exorbitant amounts on stock buybacks. They jumped on Friday on the capitulating words from a wrinkly but influential old hag whose husband represents no conflict of interest whatsoever to make gains for the week. I would say it‚Äôs unfuckingbelievable but, come on, it‚Äôs completely believable.  ADM, convicted price-fixer and an indispensable cog in the American food supply system, shat all over callholders with a 2% drop starting EOD Monday. It rallied hard, tanked again overnight Thursday, and had another monster day on Friday to finish up 0.13% on the week ($0.06). Wild shit.   GE, the flagbearer of Boomerland, gained over 2.5% after a pretty choppy week.   Hope you enjoyed this week‚Äôs tour of Boomerland. Sorry there weren‚Äôt as many jokes this time; yours truly got fucking wrecked this week with both puts and calls. I‚Äôm gonna gonna watch the dancing bear gif for a while to cheer me up.

The worldwide image is similar, although it‚Äôs difficult to find a concrete number, a significant chunk of the populace is involved in driving professions(there are about 240,000 registered rickshaws in Dhaka alone!). These jobs are mostly GONE.  Uber, Waymo, Volvo, Apple, Tesla, BMW, GM, Baidu, Tencent and every other tech or motor companies that do not want them to become irrelevant(no company does) are developing self-driving cars. Some of them have already developed cars that can drive without any major headaches and have driven thousands of kilometres, completely safely.  And considering that, self-driving cars don‚Äôt drink, don‚Äôt get tired, don‚Äôt text, don‚Äôt phone etc, it‚Äôs very easy to see why they are already a better replacement for most drivers.  And so, they are already better than human drivers and they are the simplest solution to the extreme problem of traffic as well.

If you are Mary Barra, do you have to walk away from the deal? Hmmm. Why would you? **Why would you walk away from 2 billion dollars for free PLUS a battery customer**? You have nothing to lose here, except for some reputation, since Barra said ""appropriate due-dillgence"" was done. But hey, what due-dilligence needs to be done? **NO DUE-DILLIGENCE needs to be done.** **If you have nothing to lose in a deal, and you can walk away freely, why would you need to do any due-dilligence?**  Now, since the deal has not been closed, and NKLA's share has plummetted more than 50%. If you are Mary Barra, who wants to continue to pursue this ""no-lose"" deal anyway, WOULD YOU STILL ACCEPT THE OLD TERMS? Hey, Nikola, you agreed to give me 2 billion worth (or 11%) of stake when the company was worth 20B, now your company is worth 7B, **OF COURSE I WANT MORE THAN 11% OF YOUR DAMN STAKES NOW right**? Original 2 billion worth of stocks will now be 27% of the company.  And now, CNBC's LeBeau speaks, ""GM may take more than 11% stake on NKLA"". Hey bro, **I need you to tell me this shit information**? Yeah, NKLA is 10% up now. But wait a minute, **how can this shitty deal, which now benefits GM even more, benefit NKLA in anyway at all**? Nope, I dont't see it.  Maybe the LeBeau guy is long NKLA stocks, now he plays with words to fool you retards. Headlines easily fool retards. Why spend ten minutes reading into the story and doing the thinking, while you can simply make your investment decision after spending 10 seconds reading a headline? (I mean, just look at SNOW's rise 2 days ago)  In the end, I simply can't emphasize enough, **this deal is sweet for GM and horrible for NKL**A. But NKLA has to take it because it is desperate. It's simply unable to build trucks by itself.   **Risk disclaimer: I am not telling you NKLA share will go down**. Although I am short NKLA, the greater fool theory tell us, as long as there are more people misunderstanding the headline, the stock may go up. **Invest with caution.**"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1525367|public|confidence|self|||The NKLA-GM deal.

Who in the fuck would purchase an EV from GM when Tesla exists? Total retards, people more retarded than even us here retards. GM probably knows this and really wants a separate entity to promote their fresh lineup.   What could happen: GM takes over NKLA, shakes up the brand or straight up renames it (maybe not) and releases their future EVs under this company. All in all this will pump NKLA shares massively in the short term at least when this is announced.

The discovery was apparently made when Trevor tried to bury one of the illegal immigrants who fell off his roof while installing solar panels in order to meet quarterly targets.   ""We see it as a natural progression from making EVs, to hydrogen vehicles, to partnering with GM, to buying our truck designs, to installing solar panels on the rooftop of my humble home. Oil was the only missing aspect in our portfolio which is already more diverse than my personal dildo collection.""   ""Speaking of dildos, we shall be introducing a full range of a new product line made from crude oil:  Lube. We strongly believe that the upcoming Nikola World event is likely to rip our investors a new asshole, and it it our highest privilege to assist them in every way"" said Trevor, with his usual calm demeanor and fake glasses.   When asked about his next moves, he looked into our reporters eyes and calmly said, ""Milfs.""   Reports from highly placed sources also tell us that he has filed for officially changing his surname to Milfton in order to demonstrate his commitment to this venture, just like his previous endeavours. ""I am of the opinion that this pandemic brings a new opportunity for NKLA to make tendies in a previously under (booty) tapped market, and milfs shall be even better than TSLA's self driving technology as the value proposition simply makes more sense. People love Milfs, and we shall create a fleet of milfs who shall drive our milk trucks, codenamed MilfTrucks.""   GM has extended positive support to this initiative and a new deal is expected to be reported soon. A milk supplier shall be identified, and first orders have already been received from... Trevor.  Jim Cramer compared this to Apple's pivot after Steve Jobs came back for the second time, and upgraded the stock to a strong buy. ""After having received a barrel, I am convinced that this company shall exceed expectations, and it could possibly receive many orders from Boeing, or even better, Stark Industries.""

Which is like 4% of GM sales    3) The Bolt has bad reviews and costs way too much. Model 3 is same price and better cause of supercharger network.    4) Nikola deal was 2 bil in Stock but now it's only worth 1 bil over 5 years with some covenants. 200 mil / years isn't worth the PR risk and engineering work. Associating yourself with Nikola now makes your EV team look like your way behind.    5) Covid hurts GM and will probably make them suck for the next 3 years. Rental cars aren't upgrading their fleets. Dividend was slashed March last earning a was -700mil    6) GM sucks at EVs their sustainability report was terrible. They do not have the ability to make an economic cheap EV and are years behind.    Hold timeframe    1) I short stock so I'm prepped to hold for 3 years barring a trigger event or a gain of +7% below $27    2) could be next week when GM pulls out of Nikola deal    Positions  Short GM|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1520088|public|confidence|self|||DD - GM has a lot of negative potential|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j07i1o/dd_gm_has_a_lot_of_negative_potential/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-09-26|GM

There have been several DD's on GME this month so I just wanted to provide another perspective that gives evidence to the fact that the risk/reward on the LONG side is very attractive.   Let's take a look at GME's balance sheet as of 2Q20.  https://preview.redd.it/5s7xoxo8mbp51.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf72617aceef6cc36e90c89c0284d69ba036c7f  As you can see above, GME has $735.1MM of cash on hand, $221.3MM of short-term debt, and $215.9MM of long-term debt. That means GME has a net cash position of $297.9M! If GME were to stop all operations, shut down all stores, and never sell a console again, equity value would be the value of cash less debt, or $297.9M. At the time of writing this post, GME's market cap is $638.7M. The market is implying that GME's future earnings are worth $340.8M (in other words, the current market cap minus net cash position).   Now, it is clear that GME's core business is in the shitter. Let's not deny that. Revenue continues to decline as disc sales disappear, and gross margins are trending down due to many factors including mix shift (consoles are lower GM% than discs), but there are some bright spots over the next 6 months. For one, a new console cycle is just beginning and when GME makes it to 4Q20, there will be a nice revenue bump that can send shorts screaming. Then you introduce the activist attention. I worked at HF for several years and if there's one thing I learned, it's that it's very hard to short an activist. They can make a lot of noise and even if results don't follow, the higher probability of success results in a higher multiple. In this case, we even may see results in 4Q, and even if they aren't a result of an activist, it will get people excited (or spooked in the case of short sellers).   GME $12C 10/30exp for the short-term juice, GME $22C 1/15/21exp for the 4Q bump.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1519214|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ynMacH25MuHzIoGH5eDASP-jJMMIkMdR9NLAbVk96AU.jpg|94.0|140.0|Long GME (a balance sheet DD)|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/izmt4l/long_gme_a_balance_sheet_dd/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-09-25|GM

Since my previous big NKLA post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itjdnk/nkla\_is\_finished/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itjdnk/nkla_is_finished/) the stock dropped from a high of $34 to around $18. Many people made a fuckload of tendies, but now would be a stupid time to take profits. The cliff is insight, and the truck is in motion, let's watch it roll.  Here's why NKLA will trade sub $15 EoW.   1. BP pull out of Hydrogen infrastructure deal with NKLA. [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/23/nikola-stock-closed-down-xx-after-bp-backs-away-fr/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/23/nikola-stock-closed-down-xx-after-bp-backs-away-fr/) The reason for pulling out is the Hindenburg report and all the controversy since then. This is absolutely critical to NKLA and I can not state this enough. NKLA was never meant to make much profit from it's vehicles, they have said time and time again, the money is from selling hydrogen. This is a huge setback that has completely annihilated the NKLA bussiness model. Source: Jeff Ubben, NKLA Director and early investor in NKLA [https://www.ft.com/content/e5aeb036-fc1a-49d2-970e-63b4879f1973](https://www.ft.com/content/e5aeb036-fc1a-49d2-970e-63b4879f1973) "" We are not trying to sell trucks, we are trying to sell hydrogen "" 2. This is my own speculation: GM will pull out of the NKLA deal. There are no downsides to the deal for GM yes you're right. But there are similarities to the BP deal. NKLA was going to pay BP to build a hydrogen infrastructure, no downsides to BP but they still pulled out because of everything since the report. NKLA will not have 700mill to pay upfront to GM for the manufacturing line, 11% of NKLA stock is going to be worth less than 100mill when they start selling it. On top of that, everyone is cancelling their Badger pre-orders, so 80% BEV credits on 0 trucks is 0 profit. I expect GM to announce they are out by EoW or next week. 3. NKLA futher downgraded: [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nkla-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2020-09/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nkla-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2020-09/) $15 price target. This is the start of more downgrades in my opinion. 4. On 3rd December, all the initial investors from the VectoIQ merger such as IVECO will be eligible to sell their shares. This is a huge dilution that is imminent 5. Ongoing SEC/DoJ investigation as well as lawsuits coming NKLAs way 6. Q3 earnings will be a disaster if they even make it that far. Cash on hand was 600mill, that's the only thing this company has going for them.   Overally NKLA is the same stock it was before it went public and after it went public at $10. The only difference now is there is too much downward momentum with no positive catalysts in sight. NKLA world will most likely be cancelled. This company will go bankrupt or delisted, it's a race to see which happens first."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1517632|public|confidence|self|||NKLA: More Room To Roll|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyx8wf/nkla_more_room_to_roll/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '4hat1zfdYtC0d1tX0h-j42-obSOATv_Q5hze_09RC84', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff5e6a769724b5cfa62925555e1bd8bc33a4deb', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f68625f85d3de4b9f47bbe99d0eea1b7c70915d', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e566bd4e54c0cd434811c61378d168b70314d38', 'width': 320}, {'height': 335, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c965a768d63c49f635a67d1ea2a381a43b5bddd2', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6329bcb53d222606a685a2d1914b324ce3d1f25c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 565, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c4ab43321ab651b4e500bec94299cc633a60a68', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1440, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/r5TJH17x_OgAQeXkHEPqNRGgQL0Qw82iBTXEPxtTxB8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=093d085076bf6454d142299f8a887f0e7d3c420f', 'width': 2750}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-09-24|GM

Nelson, who covers Tesla for CFRA and has been critical of the stock‚Äôs valuation in the past ‚Äî thinks a President Biden could unlock further earnings power for the EV maker.  Nelson adds, ‚ÄúFor example, talking about building out the number of EV charging stations in the U.S. which currently stands at about 27,000. Biden wants to increase that by a half a million. So that would be a 20-fold increase in the number of EV charging station in the U.S. which would help Tesla tremendously. Biden also wants to increase both tax credits and tax breaks to really stimulate both the production and sale of electric vehicles, which we think Tesla would benefit from as the only electric vehicle maker.‚Äù  To Nelson‚Äôs point, Biden‚Äôs EV proposals cut across three different lanes as a means to stimulate demand. All three would not only be good news for the bottom line of Tesla, but to General Motors, Ford, Toyota that are all racing to get EVs to market within the next five years. Even Amazon through its investment in electric truck maker Rivian could see a Biden boost.  First, Biden would offer rebates for consumers to swap out older, less fuel efficient cars for electric vehicles manufactured in the United States. The plan mirrors the Obama era administration‚Äôs ‚ÄòCash for Clunkers‚Äô scheme that came at the height of the Great Recession in 2009.  Meantime, Biden would like to upgrade the government‚Äôs fleet of autos to electric vehicles. At the moment, the government uses a wide range of suppliers for its various autos ‚Äî from GM for the president‚Äôs Cadillac to Ford pickup trucks for border patrol. One would have to think Tesla and its all-American production story stands to play in any government car upgrade.  And then lastly is Biden‚Äôs plan to add a half million new charging stations. That would go a long way to reducing the range of anxiety inherent to many drivers fearful of switching from gas-powered cars.  Maybe Tesla CEO Elon Musk wasn‚Äôt so crazy at ‚ÄòBattery Day‚Äô when saying he would like to produce 20 million cars a year (up from 500,000 or so today).

For anyone who looks at theta gang like the simps of the options world - have you ever thought you could make equally retarded, wsb level plays by using options mechanics that aren‚Äôt just buying weekly calls or puts? I know it sounds crazy, but you can SELL those too.   Check the 30 day implied volatility out...180...juicier than your mom‚Äôs WAP. If you know anything past kindergarten math, it means options are more expensive, especially puts since that is the direction of the huge move today. What did we learn in stonk school? Buy low sell high. What am I suggesting we could be doing here? Both. Sell puts on high implied volatility and time value, and set a level to buy low. Short Vega, positive theta, long stonks. Implied volatility is mean reverting (HV 30 at 155), Father Time always wins, and stonks only go up.   Take a look at the chain. You can sell 10/2 puts at 20 for $155 with only $2,000 of collateral. Look up and down the chain, and there are plenty of different plays here. That‚Äôs almost 8% in 11 days. For this to fuck you, NKLA has to drop 25% in 11 days. Is it 300% you think you could get playing the Tesla battery day hype? No, but let‚Äôs be real, you‚Äôre going to find a way to fuck up that trade anyways and play the what if game, while jerking off to the 5 members of this sub who actually happen to get it right. This trade carries the risk of assignment and losing all of the principal, but this is a cheap enough stock and I know more people have $1,845 ($2,000-$155) they are willing to risk in the quest for learning the ways of the tard. Why not do it on a play with a 90% probability of success?  This is still wsb level autism let‚Äôs be clear. Nikola probably is a bullshit company and might implode at some point. That being said, I don‚Äôt think GM would just throw money into something that had completely zero value. I‚Äôm sure they did due diligence, and the preorders they have for their trucks are real orders. The short seller calling them fraudulent has his own obvious interests and is looking to scare out the weak hands for a quick buck. We know this shit will probably have some crazy positive and negative days ahead regardless. All I‚Äôm saying is, you can make exciting plays, while actually having some options mechanics working in your favor like volatility reversion and theta decay. This should be a moment celebrated by the autismos but I‚Äôm seeing more comments being scared off by the volatility and Trevor Milton stepping down. Hopefully someone will have taken away something from this.

Spoiler alert: it wasn‚Äôt.   Anyway, come along with me on a brief tour of Boomerland for the week ending September 18th, 2020. Keep your penises inside the vehicle at all times, please; we don‚Äôt need another lawsuit.  We kick it off with GE, whose stock rose over 15% this week...yup. 15%. Why? Because the guy in charge of making investors feel good about their investment made statements to the effect of, ‚Äús‚Äôall good, man.‚Äù Fucking brilliant - they should have done that years ago.   In a shoutout to their own products, it was a wild ride for BA this week. After rising nearly 5%, congress released a scathing report titled, ‚ÄúTha Fuck Is Wrong With Boeing?‚Äù. Investor response was emphatically ‚ÄúLol; Congress‚Äù but tempered expectations for a particularly phat check from the geriatric overloads come budget scuffle season. Flatish for the week (-0.4% ish).   GM spun the fuck out of their *less than WSB-worthy* NKLA DD and somersaulted that shitshow into an announcement for a new line of EVs. Investors heard ‚ÄúEV‚Äù and ‚Äúsynergy‚Äù and proceeded to splooge all over the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button. Up 2.5% for the week.   KO, bellweather of the global economy and Atlanta‚Äôs favorite former cocaine dealer, made waves this week by barely making waves this week. It defended $50/share like Leonidas and the Spartans at the Hot Gates of Thermopylae. Ended the week -0.88%.   Current drug dealer, PFE, came off one fine doozy of a weekend pump to hit +2.85% about midday Monday. The comedown was gentle, aided by a constant supply of ‚Äúmight save the global economy‚Äù to end the week +0.44%.   PM (Philip Morris), saw all the cool tech kids bleeding from their buttholes and decided it looked like fun. It was a gradual, steady, and completely non-addictive descent into -4.3%.  Nestle was mostly flat for the week because growth is slightly harder when you already own everything fucking consumer brand. *Was* flat, anyway, until freaky Friday came around and investors said, ‚Äúno; I think you‚Äôre worth less today.‚Äù -1.3% ish for the week.  Hope you enjoyed this week‚Äôs tour of Boomerland. It was pretty damn interesting, actually.

Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don‚Äôt wait for nickel to go back to some long ‚Äî some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.‚Äù  **&gt;&gt;&gt;THE STARS ALIGNED&lt;&lt;&lt;**  The following points are largely circumstantial evidence, however when stacked together create an extremely powerful narrative and points toward the extreme likelihood of $VALE actually having lined up a *revolutionary* deal with Tesla.  **Quotes from Tesla Q2 2020 Earnings Call**  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much to be excited about. It‚Äôs really hard to kind of fit into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing/engineering front is mind-blowing. And then of course there‚Äôs Battery Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that‚Äôs really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.‚Äù-Elon Musk  ‚ÄúYeah. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That‚Äôs the real limit. So that‚Äôs where ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to talk about ‚Äî a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be a limiting factor. So whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining ‚Äî there‚Äôs many steps from refining to cathode and anode, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others, and there‚Äôs a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.‚Äù-Elon Musk  ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don‚Äôt wait for nickel to go back to some long ‚Äî some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. [Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s), if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.‚Äù-Elon Musk  ‚ÄúLike the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we‚Äôre all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yeah, we need to not go bankrupt, obviously. That‚Äôs important, because then we‚Äôll fail in our mission. But we‚Äôre not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, just 1% or 2%. It‚Äôs not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth, and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to achieve.‚Äù-Elon Musk  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img c7y5dnf6qpn51...*  **Philippe Houchois ‚Äî Jefferies ‚Äî Analyst**  ‚ÄúYes, good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times about the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you‚Äôre building right now. Will there be ‚Äî the battery capacity consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Will you have to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?  Elon Musk ‚Äî Chief Executive Officer  Okay. We can‚Äôt say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production, and that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory.

Historically, we all know mines have run into trouble with being friendly toward the environment. Today more than ever, a company's concern for the environment must be vocally expressed and physically acknowledged. If not, the reporters and media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses must at least appear as if they are environmentally ‚Äúsensitive"".

Alright listen, we got killed today with the stock rising 10% from its PM trading. Let's look at why though.  JPM analyst Paul Coster reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and threw his full confidence behind it: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nikola-stock-price-jpmorgan-analyst-defends-company-following-cfo-meeting-2020-9-1029595994#](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nikola-stock-price-jpmorgan-analyst-defends-company-following-cfo-meeting-2020-9-1029595994#)  So this analyst met with the management who told him everything is going fine so that means everything is going fine right? That's how this works. Bare in mind Paul Coster is so bad at stock analysis he may as well not be one: [https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster) \-0.4% returns on his ratings in the last year. How are you losing 0.4% this year in the middle of the greatest bull run ever?   None of the companies have pulled out yet, but they don't have any reason to at the moment - not until SEC/DoJ gets NKLA anyways. NKLA has basically used their IPO money to pay the likes of Bosch, IVECO and soon GM to use those companies technology/3rd party technology to build trucks for them. NKLA has NO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. They have 0 R&amp;D, these deals are not partnerships, these manufacturers are providing a service to NKLA. It's the same as me making a company called Hill and paying GM to make my truck, called In Motion 1. To pay for my In Motion 1 orders, I've just conned my way in and got money from blinded investors. So when they all say they all did their due dillegence, all that means is these companies are getting paid by NKLA and they have no downside... that's it.  Anyways as one ex-fund manager puts it, TM is going to jail eventually: [https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/09/nikola-nkla-block-gsx-techedu/](https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/09/nikola-nkla-block-gsx-techedu/)  So don't paper hand and lose it all (unless ur puts expire soon), NKLA is a house of cards that the SEC and DoJ is gonna run over with a bulldozer, and that bulldozer does have propulsion.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1499981|public|confidence|self|||NKLA is finished part 2: Electric Boogaloo|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iu6ewd/nkla_is_finished_part_2_electric_boogaloo/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-09-16|GM

However, the official narrative told by the shorts and confirmed by Nikola and Trevor Milton, does not make much sense. When you have a detailed look into Nikola and the official story, you can only come to one conclusion: Trevor Milton is a genius, a master troll and is playing 4D and sometimes 5D chess with the industry, the short sellers and the trolls.   **Nikola One - Gravity Powered**  Nikola made a prototype with super advanced CNG propulsion technology, then abandoned this technology completely, pivoted to Hydrogen fuel, botched the prototype and rolled it down the hill. 4 years later, the prototype is still not functional. When confronted, Nikola confirmed these allegations.  The only rational explanation is that CNG and Hydrogen are a red herring for Nikola's true technology: anti-gravity reactors. Trevor has likely channeled this alien technology through his Mormon faith. It explains the range of the trucks, the company's response and the fact that Bob Lazar has ordered 500 Nikola One trucks via his gmail account.   **Nikola Factory Construction**  Nikola started construction on their factory 55 days ago. However, drone flyovers only show some diggers drawing dicks in the sand. Nikola also does not have any permits to start building anything, yet they claim construction is full speed ahead and will be finished in 12 months.   The only rational explanation is that the entire factory is being built underground. No need for permits and invisible to drones. Rumors have it that Trevor came up with the idea after watching an episode of Better Call Saul on his private jet.  **The Deal With GM**  Nikola gave GM $2B of shares just to be a customer of GM. They then let the Hinderburg report hit, even though Trevor was tipped about it beforehand. GM's stock took a hit and they are contemplating pulling out of the deal.   It is obvious Trevor wants to hurt GM's reputation and stock price as much as possible. It does not matter that his own company will take a hit, cause it will spike up once his anti-gravity technology comes out. This is the ultimate ""Trevor with Trolls"" session. He wants to drive down GM's value as much as possible so he can buy out GM. Remember when Elon musk wanted to buy and delete Facebook? Trevor will out-elon Elon. He will buy GM and then delete it for the Lulz.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  fun with Trolls"|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1498395|public|confidence|self|||Nikola Motors - The Real Story|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itt50p/nikola_motors_the_real_story/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-09-16|GM

We can collectively make more than all of NKLA's quarterly profits from Trevor's solar array by at least an order of magnitude.  Don't buy NKLA puts:  * NKLA puts are expensive * Everyone knows it is going to burn &amp; IV is High * If it gets delisted you can't get rid of your puts. No tendies * If trading halts you may not be able to sell them back before expiry (and the stock won't drop further). I presume you could call your broker and exercise in the evening but then you may have shares you can't offload until this hits /r/pennystocks  Sell bear call spreads. I did this Monday (35/25) but my tissue paper hands dropped them at a slight loss when that rat fuck CEO at GM came in to defend them in the late morning. RIP my tendies.  Later dated the better - avoid some short squeeze bullshit that may come up since you can't even borrow this garbage right now.  Here's why you sell spreads:  * If you're selling spreads you've got your money already and if it is delisted poof calls go away unless CBOE opens an options OTC exchange somewhere (If I am wrong correct me) * IV high -&gt; good for selling * Payoff is not instant unless that turd delists, but it can't go tits up unless Trevor himself convinces Trump the all American NKLA needs saving (this is probably Trevor's best hope)  Sell against your margin if your degenerate ass isn't leveraged on AAPL FDs. If your broker is worth a shit there won't be margin interest when you sell against your equities. I am going in with the lowest December expiry wide-ass call spread I can get tomorrow if I can get some fills. Exchange showing about $5 mid price for the 30/20 spread right now.

Only reason stock hasn't collapsed yet is because retard cult following buying the dip. Tomorrow, the stock is no longer on limit down rule, meaning free fall down a hill, off a cliff, into the mariana trench.  This is for the special retards of WSB out there, exit your calls and sell your shares of this company, it's fucked. This stock is rolling down to delisted like it's shitty fake truck and you are dumb and in denial if you don't realise that.  Let's look at the evidence.  Today Hindenburg released a reply to NKLA rebuttal: [https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/) Please, just read this before you even reply. Anyone with any critical thinking skills can clearly see that this scam got caught with it's pants down at a child daycare. Remember TM pulled an allnighter after the report came out, another day and a whole weekend, just for that reply.  SEC is investigating them: [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nikola-shares-slump-amid-sec-probe-into-short-seller-claims](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nikola-shares-slump-amid-sec-probe-into-short-seller-claims)   DoJ is investigating them: [https://www.ft.com/content/a45a6638-167b-4e27-a9fd-576e7229f959](https://www.ft.com/content/a45a6638-167b-4e27-a9fd-576e7229f959)  &amp;#x200B;  The argument that GM gives the company credibility is fundamentally untrue. GM is robbing this company of it's EV subsidy (First 200k cars sold), GM gets 11% of NKLA, GM gets 700 million from NKLA (lol how the fuck is NKLA gonna pay GM 700million) with no drawbacks. The only thing NKLA contributes to GM here is their brand name (marketting), that's literally it. If either the SEC or DoJ finds anything that they can use to bury NKLA, which they definitely will, GM is going to pull out of the deal. Remember, they have until 30th Dec to pull out, and I bet the board are talking about it and weighing up their options. If any of the other collaborations pull out, that would be a catalyst for others. This argument that GM is defending NKLA makes no sense. If they didn't defend NKLA, GM stock would collapse and CEO fired. GM has no downsides to defending NKLA at all, and gains so much from this deal.  Now, lets value this stock. It's worth $13billion which is almost 1/3 GM. So what are we getting for 13 billion?  A factory? No, it's dirt field that hasn't even gotten permits for construction.  Exclusive tech? No, as shown in Hindenburg they have no tech of their own. 11 patents to it's names and if you read the patents, they're literally junk  Talented workforce? I don't even need to say anything here  Marketting? Outsourced  Working prototype? Hill  Fuck this company, let's watch it burn tomorrow.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1495229|public|confidence|self|||NKLA is finished|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itjdnk/nkla_is_finished/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'OeifvktiGBQq9Q5j6Ygnf4TzgfVQMXKPe5hJ9HHSAGE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bd7u1v2krDIO3HxMurHqu-E5lTUbWAI2631jRpDhwoo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65fd7fe11a17d3d46fe2d163714e35e887fe7890', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bd7u1v2krDIO3HxMurHqu-E5lTUbWAI2631jRpDhwoo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b547b8d5e1c5d668571f69cdc92e6e5cd1d2ed15', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bd7u1v2krDIO3HxMurHqu-E5lTUbWAI2631jRpDhwoo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a19bcc8b85a86363cdbb0ad515e455a8b3df56c3', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 305, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bd7u1v2krDIO3HxMurHqu-E5lTUbWAI2631jRpDhwoo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5146528c3a18097c8156b85f10202527aede1dc8', 'width': 406}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-09-15|GM

Calendar Bear Put Debit Spreads  Step  1. Buy 90+ DTE put options (Close positions at 45 DTE, and open again if you still have the same thesis) 2. Sell under 45 DTE put options at a lower strike (Thetagang). Closer to expiration if greedy (ThetaChad).  Pro tip: Don't let gamma delta combo cuck you if this turd nose dives like the dumpster fire that it is. If your net negative delta and net positive delta are getting close, the short-dated puts you sold starts to mirror that of a stock at 1 delta near expiration/ITM. Close your short side before it gets to that or close the entire position if you're starting to become chicken shit. You would've made a huge profit before the positive and negative deltas start to match up. I prefer to roll the short side at 50% profitability and not squeeze blood from a rock.  &amp;#x200B;  How can you profit?  1. NKLA goes down and gets flushed out of NASDAQ and trades OTC pink sheets for pennies. Finally, you reach options nirvana and stop gambling away your child's 529 college savings plan. 2. NKLA slowly drowns and you become Mr. OneDirectionThetaChad. 3. NKLA stays flatter than your wife's surfboard with 2 raisins excuse of a chest and you unknowingly joined thetagang.  &amp;#x200B;  How can you get cucked?  1. Volatile takes a nosedive (before election? lmao). Long puts negatively affected by vega drop will be worth as much as your toilet paper hands. 2. NKLA skyrockets on a partnership with Toyota to make Japanese Gundams powered by fission reactors powered over 9000 engineered by Goku himself mentored by German-Austrian engineers.  &amp;#x200B;  Why not just hold puts?  1. I know your mom dropped you on the head as a kid but really?  2. Take my screenshot for example. The total theta without the short side is -95. I'll be paying $95 per day on a $12,000 investment.  3. 95/12000 \* 100 =  0.79% AKA: I'm paying tu madre 0.79% interest per day to hold 23 puts on this floating turd in hopes that it matches my thesis in an extremely timely manner.  4. 100/0.79 = 126.5 days to lose 12k even if the direction will ultimately be right, but not the timing. 5. With this spread, you can hold this as long as you want unless it skyrockets (which contradicts the thesis we have here), and therefore losing money is all part of the game.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR  NKLA -23 Sep 25 16.5P  NKLA 18 Dec 18 20P  NKLA 5 Dec 18 25P"|False|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1494710|public|confidence|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jbArNtD2IyOo0Ci5UWvYXQDbIkoY2CJLlmCFJy-sKZY.jpg|22.0|140.0|Option play for the NKLA fire dumpster without getting theta banged|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ithw0v/option_play_for_the_nkla_fire_dumpster_without/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'CU48HBoYVzesuZjH8Rc73t9jdhzNwetWTljmj_RK0hg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a69aec2a2d14ae3d779ae65e0154e231f3b396de', 'width': 108}, {'height': 109, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a24f6b6b0295d36bb9b2340d67101b08eba7ae', 'width': 216}, {'height': 161, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d617826d5cb8b5f4a14185d484eef5adbcf6550', 'width': 320}, {'height': 323, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb46006f1d8dd391358e2348f82c747cb4791479', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3813b8a81415a0cd59b262be1ec0e9164e1558d0', 'width': 713}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-09-15|GM

TESLA is years ahead of their competition in terms of the technical aspects of electric car manufacturing in their AI systems and is expected to announce a close to 110 dollars per kWh battery production cost on battery day.  The AI development chips that TESLA also creates are years ahead of the competition according to analysts, TESLA not being included in the S&amp;P 500 can be seems as a positive as it would not be involved in an index fund bubble as theorized by Dr michael burry.  This crash in price will be corrected over time as their main competitor nikola implodes on itself, not to mention that analysts don't even know how to value TESLA stock, they attempt to value it as a motor company and many projected a loss of 800 million in the last quarter where TESLA posted a profit of 1.3 billion instead. These retard investors are the same ones who drove up nikola stock because it was affiliated with gm.  They don't understand why people buy teslas, it's not for the electric component of the car, much of the time that's a novelty. Teslas are sold on the basis of their artificial intelligence driving capability which has improved exponentially. They are sold due to the brand recognition and prestige that comes with owning one.  Teslas are the millennial Lamborghini, Honestly it seems like it did when Apple came out with the iPhone, competitors didn't realise right away that people buy it for the feature it has that no one else has, the killer app TESLA autopilot.

What principally informed my opinion was the well-written analyst report by Hindenburg. Unfortunately, the report did not contain a strike price and expiration date for options play so I had to come up with it myself, and so;  # TLDR: Invested ~$5.2k in NKLA $100 call (exp. 01/15/21)  https://preview.redd.it/1vo4a41ymjm51.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0b2a870f7da90b2cc7a8c2ead28cc4c6c09ec8  At the time of this writing, NKLA shares are trading at roughly $31.50, significantly undervalued.  My four-pronged investment thesis is below:  1. **Genius CEO:** The [Hindenburg report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/) sheds compelling light into the persona and capabilities of Trevor Milton. If the report in its entirety is true, it presents a strong case as to why one should become a long-term investor in Nikola: it proves that Trevor is a genius and able to build a $20B company by rolling a truck down a hill and swindling the world. In fact, I would be more concerned if the report is proven false, because then Trevor becomes just like any other CEO concerned with generating real shareholder value (rather than creatively orchestrating smoke and mirrors). This would make him basic and unappealing. 2. **Strong Revenue Growth:** Nikola has demonstrated [stellar revenue growth](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/nikolas-entire-quarterly-revenue-of-36000-was-from-solar-installation-for-the-executive-chairman.html) in 2Q 2020. Specifically, revenue grew from $0 to $36,000 which is an increase of infinity percent, which is remarkable for an emerging growth company. Some people will criticize the fact that this revenue was generated from the installation of solar panels for Trevor Milton, but this is actually a good catalyst for future quarters: Nikola can easily install twice as many solar panels for Trevor and continuously double its revenue. This rate of revenue growth is even more impressive than what some of the best names this year (e.g. FSLY, SE) were able to churn out. 3. **Consistent Shareholder Communication:** Trevor Milton‚Äôs transparent communication over Twitter gives him so much accessibility to shareholders. It also ensures that there will be a stream of constant updates from his part, including [important corporate developments](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1304081904677904390). Also importantly, Trevor frequently tweets about important company issues like [shareholding structure](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1285986014691913728?lang=en) and [short interest](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1304049295105032199). As someone who doesn‚Äôt like to look at financial websites and SEC filings, I very much appreciate hearing about the company‚Äôs stock price directly from the CEO.  (Speaking of CEOs, I don't understand why people keep comparing Trevor Milton to Elon Musk - they are not on the same level. I think Trevor's management skills are better compared to those of the CEO/Chairman of GSX, who did a phenomenal job of navigating his company through uncertainty) 4. **Innovative Pipeline:** People give Nikola a lot of trash because it only has renderings and drawings, but in the 2020 investing climate, this is particularly irrelevant. Nikola was able to capture the hearts and minds of General Motors with just renderings and drawings, proving that pictures and concepts are worth thousands of words (and dollars). I‚Äôm looking forward to further illustrations of NKLA‚Äôs [upcoming innovative pipeline](https://nikolamotor.com/reckless).

We have never seen this level of deception at a public company, especially of this size.  -Trevor has managed to parlay these false statements made over the course of a decade into a ~$20 billion public company. He has inked partnerships with some of the top auto companies in the world, all desperate to catch up to Tesla and to harness the EV wave. We examine how Nikola got its early start and show how Trevor misled partners into signing agreements by falsely claiming to have extensive proprietary technology.  -We reveal how, in the face of growing skepticism over the functionality of its truck, Nikola staged a video called ‚ÄúNikola One in Motion‚Äù which showed the semi-truck cruising on a road at a high rate of speed. Our investigation of the site and text messages from a former employee reveal that the video was an elaborate ruse‚ÄîNikola had the truck towed to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it rolling down the hill.  -In October 2019, Nikola announced it would revolutionize the battery industry. This was to be done through a pending acquisition, but the deal fell through when Nikola realized (a) the technology was vaporware and (b) the President of the battery company had been indicted months earlier over allegations that he conned NASA by using his expense account to procure numerous prostitutes.  -Nikola has never walked back claims relating to its battery technology. Instead, Trevor continued to publicly hype the technology even after becoming aware of the above issues. The revolutionary battery technology never existed ‚Äì now, Nikola plans to use GM‚Äôs battery technology instead.  -A spokesman for Volvo spin-off Powercell AB, a hydrogen fuel cell technology company that formerly partnered with Nikola, called Nikola‚Äôs battery and hydrogen fuel cell claims ‚Äúhot air‚Äù.  -In addition to now using GM‚Äôs battery technology, Nikola seeks to use the automaker‚Äôs production and fuel cell capabilities. Nikola seems to be bringing nothing to the partnership but concept designs, their brand name and up to $700 million they will be paying GM for costs related to production.  -Inexpensive hydrogen is fundamental to the success of Nikola‚Äôs business model. Trevor has claimed in a presentation to hundreds of people and in multiple interviews to have succeeded at cutting the cost of hydrogen by ~81% compared to peers and to already be producing hydrogen. Nikola has not produced hydrogen at this price or at any price as he later admitted when pressed by media.  -Trevor has appointed his brother, Travis, as ‚ÄúDirector of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure‚Äù to oversee this critical part of the business. Travis‚Äôs prior experience looks to have largely consisted of pouring concrete driveways and doing subcontractor work on home renovations in Hawaii.  -Claims of owning energy producing assets is not new for Nikola. Trevor claimed that Nikola‚Äôs headquarters has 3.5 megawatts of solar panels on its roof producing energy. Aerial photos of the roof and later media reports show that the supposed panels don‚Äôt exist.  -At one point Nikola claimed to own its own natural gas wells. There is no evidence in company filings to support this. The claims were eventually quietly removed from Nikola‚Äôs website.  -Trevor claims Nikola designs all key components in house, but they appear to simply be buying or licensing them from third-parties. One example: we found that Nikola actually buys inverters from a company called Cascadia. In a video showing off its ‚Äúin-house‚Äù inverters, Nikola concealed the Cascadia label with a piece of masking tape.  -In a July 2020 podcast, Trevor said of Nikola‚Äôs ‚ÄúTre‚Äù truck: ‚ÄúWe have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm Germany.‚Äù A spokesperson for Bosch, the manufacturing partner building the trucks, confirmed this month that they haven‚Äôt made any trucks yet.  -The company‚Äôs Nikola One ‚Äúreveal‚Äù was a total farce. We corroborate Bloomberg‚Äôs earlier work debunking Trevor‚Äôs claims regarding its semi-truck that ‚Äúthis thing fully functions and works‚Ä¶this is a real truck‚Äù and provide new evidence.  -We present behind-the-scenes photos showing that Nikola had an electricity cable snaked up from underneath the stage into the truck in order to falsely claim the Nikola One‚Äôs electrical systems fully functioned.  -We learned through emails and interviews with former partners that Trevor had an artist stencil ‚ÄúH2‚Äù and ‚ÄúZero Emission Hydrogen Electric‚Äù on the side of the Nikola One despite it having no hydrogen capabilities whatsoever; it was built with natural gas components.  -We also present evidence that subsequent ‚Äúreveals‚Äù were fictitious. In 2019, Nikola revealed a ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù version of its off-road vehicle. We learned that it was scrapped within weeks of the unveiling due to manufacturing challenges. The redesign work was then quietly outsourced.  -Nikola‚Äôs much-touted multi-billion dollar order book is filled with fluff. U.S. Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations, representing ~$3.5 billion in orders. U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on hand last quarter.  -Nikola‚Äôs key partners and backers have been cashing out aggressively. Worthington, Bosch and ValueAct have all sold shares. Worthington sold $237 million shares over a 2-day span in July and another $250 million in August. We think they know exactly what type of company Nikola is, and we expect that as Nikola‚Äôs GM ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù boosts the stock price, key holders will continue to exit.  -We think Trevor Milton, through dozens of outright lies, was able to form partnerships with some of the largest legacy auto companies in the world in their desperation to catch up to Tesla‚Äôs EV leadership status.  -Trevor has ensured he is not going down with the ship.  He cashed out $70 million around the IPO and amended his share lock-up from 1-year to 180 days. If he is fired, his equity awards immediately vest and he is entitled to collect $20 million over two years. Milton has laid the groundwork to extract hundreds of millions from Nikola years before ever delivering on his promises.  Every now and then a story comes around that exposes how little the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù really know. Theranos inked partnerships with Walgreens, Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and staffed its board with luminaries. We think Nikola‚Äôs partners did not do their homework.‚Äù  [https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)  The actual link shows what Hindenburg was referencing above.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1482733|public|confidence|self|||Nikola: How to Parlay An Ocean of Lies Into a Partnership With the Largest Auto OEM in America - Hindenburg|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iq4yte/nikola_how_to_parlay_an_ocean_of_lies_into_a/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'CU48HBoYVzesuZjH8Rc73t9jdhzNwetWTljmj_RK0hg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a69aec2a2d14ae3d779ae65e0154e231f3b396de', 'width': 108}, {'height': 109, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a24f6b6b0295d36bb9b2340d67101b08eba7ae', 'width': 216}, {'height': 161, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d617826d5cb8b5f4a14185d484eef5adbcf6550', 'width': 320}, {'height': 323, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb46006f1d8dd391358e2348f82c747cb4791479', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2iXoqgTd-dyDZQJ_qOLy01xfFi_-paJ8cDifrQWYz5s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3813b8a81415a0cd59b262be1ec0e9164e1558d0', 'width': 713}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2020-09-10|GM

Why couldnt GM not have done this on their own. They have the tech, they have the factories, they have the capital, they have the marketing relationships. However if they had executed under the GM brand they would have to use Union labor.  Now as they are setiing up a ""new"" factory for NKLA they can fire the existing union workers and hire non-union workforce for NKLA. This is basically why TSLA has been eating their lunch - TSLA is non-union. Now by using NKLA as the stalking horse GM can be non-union for their EV products as well.  Eventually I see GM buying NKLA, merging it with their EV group and spinning off the new company or doing a reverse takeover where NKLA does a takeover of GM EV business but GM gets majority shares in NKLA and controls NKLA as their EV subsidiary.

In a way it's true, they basically became a sub-brand of GM at least as far as the Badger and class 7/8 trucks are concerned.  Lets take a closer look at what the new partnership entails; GM gets a 14% stake in NKLA in exchange for 2 Billion Jpow Bucks worth of *in-kind* contributions.   Note that this isn't ""$2b worth of new parts at market value"", ""$2b of development resources"", or ""an exclusive licence to $2b of GM's technologies"".  For parts and platforms already designed, this is nothing but free cash for GM. Sell NKLA excess parts off your line whenever there's an overrun for whatever you want.   $1500 cost fully dressed suspension system? That will be $2500 thanks!  In addition, GM can simply develop new parts for their own EV vehicles, bill NKLA for the development AND the parts, and sell the exact same vehicle with a bowtie for less money at their own dealership networks. NKLA owner want's service? That'll be market rate for a non-GM product with NKLA paying out the warranty.   So why would GM do this? Why even bother creating a possible competitor?  The only possible explanation that I can see is that GM simply wants to subsidize their electric vehicle development. Who cares about a 14% stake? You can effectively write off all EV development to the SoftBanks of the world who will endlessly pump more and more money into the new shiny EV brand with no assets, no manufacturing ability, and no IP.  The icing on the cake is that NKLA, as a new manufacturer, is still eligible for tax credits. So not only is GM getting subsidized by unwitting Japaneese boomers they get yet another chance to suck on that sweet sweet government teat.  When the money finally runs out GM loses nothing, all sales final and all rights reserved.  Maybe not now, maybe not in a year, but eventually GM will take all your tears to the bank.

The Nasdaq Composite underperformed with a 4.1% decline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) and Russell 2000 (-2.0%) declined closer to 2.0%.  * Today's selling was largely a continuation of last week, but unlike Friday, buyers appeared unwilling to buy the dip. Apple (AAPL 112.82, -8.14, -6.7%) and Tesla (TSLA 330.21, -88.11, -21.1%), which led the market on the way up, led the market lower today, with Tesla shareholders discontent that the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee snubbed the stock from the benchmark index.  * Tesla's 21% decline was a drag on the Nasdaq, while Apple's 7% decline pressured the large-cap indices and the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector (-4.6%). The energy (-3.7%) and financials (-2.6%) sectors followed suit amid weaker oil prices ($36.76/bbl, -2.94, -7.4%) and lower Treasury yields, while the utilities sector (-0.6%) declined the least.  * Besides concerns that the market's pullback had more room to go, investors had to contend with Democratic leadership rebuffing the Senate's $300 billion coronavirus relief bill, President Trump suggesting disincentives for U.S. companies to outsource jobs to China, and reports that China's largest semiconductor foundry could be added to a trade blacklist. * The prospect of potential retaliation on U.S. semiconductor companies was an additional drag on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.7%). Separately, Boeing (BA 161.08, -9.97, -5.8%) provided a disappointing update, saying 787 Dreamliner production problems have slowed the pace of deliveries.  * There were some notable winners, though. Nikola (NKLA 50.05, +14.50, +40.8%) and General Motors (GM 32.38, +2.38, +7.9%) formed a strategic partnership that was well-received by investors. Walt Disney (DIS 134.20, +2.21, +1.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank.  * U.S. Treasuries saw increased buying interest amid the decline in equities but closed off highs. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield declined four basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.8% to 93.46. Oil prices were pressured by Saudi Aramco lowering its prices for buyers in Asia and the U.S. due to sluggish demand.  * Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index and the JOLTS - Job Openings report for July on Wednesday.   ## Index Summary  **S&amp;P 500 :** (-2.73%);  **NasDaq :** (-4.76%);   **Russell 2000 :**(-1.92%);  **Dow :**(-2.25%);   **Vix :**31.46 0.71 (+2.31%)  ## Sector Summary -  *Three highest sectors for today were -*   **Utilities:** (-0.56%); **Real Estate:** (-1.27%); **Consumer Discretionary:** (-1.31%)   *Three lowest sectors for today were -*   **Information Technology:** (-4.52%); **Energy:** (-3.64%); **Communication Services:** (-2.64%)     ## Commodities/Futures  (1-day %), \[5-day %\], {10-day %}  ***Currency -***   **USD Index :**92.719 (+0.86%); \[+1.28%\]; {+0.57%}; **BC :**10015 (+0.2%); \[-16.89%\]; {-10.96%}  ***Precious Metals -***   **Gold :**1943.2 (-0.21%); \[-1.48%\]; {+0.91%}; **Silver :**26.991 (-0.63%); \[-5.86%\]; {-0.7%}  ***Farming -***   **Soybeans :**973 (+0.1%); \[+1.19%\]; {+3.92%}; **Corn :**361.75 (-0.07%); \[+3.36%\]; {+5.01%};   **Coffee :**134 (-1.79%); \[+0.08%\]; {+7.04%}  ***Industrials -***   **Crude :**36.76 (-0.19%); \[-14.2%\]; {-14.75%}; **Nat Gas :**2.4 (-1.54%); \[-6.49%\]; {-8.38%}   **Copper :**3.025 (-0.55%); \[-0.03%\]; {+1.47%}  ## Options Fast Facts  ***CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.67***   ***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** APA with 10x the ADV of 9306.

The announcement will be coming in 1-3 weeks, with current upside potential being a solid swing play, or long hold.**  **Who is Worksport?**  Worksport (WKSP) is a Toronto based company that manufactures high quality, cost-effective tonneau covers for truck beds. It is the revenue-generating subsidiary of Franchise Holdings International and holds the patent to the TerraVis System which is the solar-power tonneau cover for truck beds.  Source: [Worksport Website](https://worksport.com/us/)  **Well, what is a tonneau cover and why is it important?**  Tonneau covers are the #1 accessory purchased for pickup trucks. As of 2019, Pickup trucks are the #1 selling automotive in the United States making up 19% of all vehicle sales in 2019. There are currently 56 million pickup trucks on the road with roughly 15 million new trucks are sold annually. 80% of all pickup trucks have after-market tonneau covers.

Worksport also owns IP/patents on the plastic molds, aluminum dies, processes, and associated tools in building their tonneau systems.  They are also currently the only company that offers a B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to customer) focused on the light truck market and offering solar-power generating tonneau cover. Their main competition, Truck Hero, makes up a large part of the market sector but does not offer a competitor to the TerraVis system.  **What‚Äôs so important about the TerraVis system?**  The TerraVis System is currently the only after-market vehicle accessory that generates, stores, and transfers solar-power to the vehicle or external batteries. Worksport holds the patent for the solar-tonneau system and is currently filing sub-patents for various components of the system.  Here are two videos of the system:  [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9JP8t8jvw)  [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lInSYqxM2gY&amp;t=1s)  **What‚Äôs the hype?**  Worksport announced they have entered into a $70 million OEM agreement with a U.S. based EV truck manufacturer to deliver their TerraVis system, with the likelihood of additional revenue moving forward. An official statement from the U.S. based EV Truck manufacturer on their purchase of the TerraVis tonneaus will be coming in mid-September.

(Buy the Rumor, Sell the News)**  There are currently three rumors on who Worksport is contracted with.  Rumor 1: Rivian (Amazon backed-company)  The CEO of Worksport, Steven Rossi has previously corresponded with Rivian‚Äôs founder RJ Scaring and Worksport‚Äôs parent company FNHI has posted several articles praising the company in what would seem like a mutually beneficial partnership.  Source: [https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/](https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/)  Rumor 2: Tesla  Elon Musk was quoted in late August stating that a solar-panel system on the Cybertruck would generate roughly 15 miles of range per day. This is an almost identical amount to what the TerraVis would provide. Additionally (and probably more compelling), Tesla will be holding it‚Äôs acclaimed ‚ÄúBattery Day‚Äù on September 22nd, directly in the window of when the partnership should be announced.

As they hyped this trash up I bought $4 puts a month and a half out and waited.    Later that day my GM who loves Donald trump asked me if he should buy more to average down (it had dropped a bit).

Yesterday they had a market cap at 460 billion fucking dollars.  Ford floats around 25Bil Honda floats around 45Bil.

I.e. the fucking opposite of Tesla.  I know we're all too busy collectively jerking off to hot pictures of TSLA gains but if you all took your hands off your dicks for two seconds, you might see TSLA could literally tank 75% and *still* be one of the highest valued auto manufacturers in the world.

Back then, $400 pre split was too high. That's $80 now for those of you that can't fucking count.  So lets go with a great case, never-gonna-happen scenario. Lets go with a *super fucking lenient* valuation of 150Bil. That's 62% lower than today's close, and a share price of $158. Still ~50% higher than valuations 6 months ago.  Shittier scenario? The the MM shit their pants and it moves closer to mainstream auto competitors. 75Bil valuation brings is 82% drop from today's close, share price of $73.

It‚Äôs not unforeseeable that if enough autists have a common goal, these futuristic pump-plays can run for extended periods (see BYND, SPCE, TSLA, PTON).  **There are no options. Where‚Äôs the return?**  But there‚Äôs warrants, which are like options, but they expire in 2027. They might as well expire in 2100 because that time frame is some boomer shit. But the good news is these warrants still provide leverage;  The strike price is $11.50 stock and the warrants are trading around $6 right now. The stock is at $21 after hours so there‚Äôs even some arbitrage to be made just through buying warrants and exercising.  Swinging or hodling the warrants could also be good. **If the market cap went from $5B to even $20B, the stock would be $110, which means your warrants would go from $6 to $100** (and that‚Äôs not even factoring in any time premium from the long expiry).  **The EV craze is real.**  Tesla proved that gasoline powered cars are a thing of the past.

Your hard earned dollars in already inflated pig trading at 1300PE, but most importantly, what does this signify? That TSLA is running low/out of cash and need $5 Billion to fulfill corporate operations. With inflation around the corner, dollar will be worth less than toilet paper, and then cash struggling companies like TSLA will see some real fucking problems. (Also side note: During high Inflationary period, the smart money usually move from ""GrOwTH"" stocks to ""Value"" stocks with actual strong fundamentals and which tends to be Cash rich and well positioned)  Now the scam part? These shares being issued are issued on top of all the outstanding shares already. To put this in perspective, Elon Musk who is now worth $110Bil (mostly because of TSLA stock being up like 1000% this year), and if he actually believed in the cause for which he is raising the money for, could've simply just file for a $5Billion sale of personal stock and fund without seeing almost no dent in his personal wealth, but no, he is preserving his personal wealth and raising the $5 Billion from you to fund operations of his company, aka,  transferring the risk to average public and will only see a minor dilution in his ownership.   Something to think about.  PS- A general statement about TSLA being insanely hyper overvalued. Today, its an EV company, and the argument that its a technology/energy/growth company with big long-term outlook has zero grounds today as all three sectors TSLA operates in are not fully established today with new competitors entering the market everyday. For ex- Almost every other day, it seems like a new EV company is starting with already established giants like Toyota, GM, Audi, Mercedes, VW etc. already entered or entering the market by 2021; there are way better, efficient and cheaper Solar options available than TSLA; and the battery and licensing EV charging stations seems to be the only clear cut division of TSLA that seems to have a real advantage, but even in that better battery systems are being created all around the world with intense competition right around the corner.

Eventually.*  GE, still unsure of exactly what business they‚Äôre in, started the week off by whipping out its gnarled and decrepit ball sack for an astonishing +4.08% show of confidence in Monday. Realizing it had misread buyers‚Äô mood but seeking to save face, it proceeded to deposit one testicle back into its whitey tidies, decided ‚Äútoo late just roll with it‚Äù and closed out the week at ~3.61% up.   BA must‚Äôve re-upped on some kind of experimental prescription because that fucker pumped. Leading the week off with a +5.6% Monday, fell to +2.15% EOD Wednesday, and then killed all BA Bears within a 50 mile radius by launching to +7% at open on Thursday. Why? Traders must have ultimately settled on a lukewarm ‚Äúidk, Fed things probably‚Äù explanation and gave up some of those gains to close out the week +4%.   Are you noticing a common theme here?  F, fucking F, popped off for a high of +4.5% early Tuesday before giving up some those gains to close the week out ~3.1% Similar pattern for GM. I don‚Äôt have any jokes for this one; that‚Äôs just what happened. Bite me.   XOM, hallowed wheeler and dealer of the dirty black go juice whose name will forever be accompanied with the epithet ‚ÄúValdez‚Äù, took a different approach to the week. Amassing a respectable +2.3% gain EOD Monday, it got kicked out of the Dow, sprung a leak, and polluted the portfolios of many a bull with a gut wrenching swing to -4.7% by midday Thursday before cleaning up a fair amount on Friday to close out the week ~-1.4%. Why all the movement? I don‚Äôt know, man; it‚Äôs oil. Shits messy.  JNJ and Johnson and Johnson did things. Sort of. +0.58% on the week. Nice.   Also CSCO with the +0.19% on the week. Killing‚Äô it.   Banks (JPM, BAC, etc) decided to not give a fuck this week about the crippling economic and regulatory shitstorm in which their businesses operate and instead decided to go for a leisurely stroll to the moon (relatively speaking) to close the week up over 4% ish. Fucking banks. Who the fuck knows why? Maybe Dimon just thought really hard and willed it into being.  KO, Atlanta‚Äôs foremost purveyor of exotic juices and tonics, started to do what literally every person on the planet has been waiting for them to do and logged a steady-rising ~5% gain on the week. Only like 16% more to go to get back to pre-covid levels.   I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of Boomerland for the week ending August 28th, 2020; it was extravagant.

First of all, the market caps.  TSLA is currently valued at $382B.  That is more than these Honda, Toyota &amp; Volkswagen (let's call them T.H.V.) combined ($315B).  In fact, you could throw in GM ($40.87B) and Hyundai ($28.63) and you'd be just about even.    Those five companies produced over 100 Million vehicles in 2017.  TSLA delivered \~367,500 vehicles in 2019.  Roughly 0.3% in comparison to those combined 5 auto companies' production in 2017.  How about revenue?  T.H.V. had combined Q1 revenue of $154.83 Billion, versus Tesla's $5.98B.  TSLA had roughly 4% of T.H.V.'s combined revenue in Q1.  Now, Q2 rolls along, and suddenly the traditional carmakers get hit pretty hard.  I mean, you remember Q2, right?  If you lived in New York City, you weren't allowed to sit on a park bench for months.  There were statewide stay-at-home orders.  The entire United States was under some form of lockdown between April &amp; May.  Same with Europe.    So what happens?  Our traditional carmakers see record declines in revenue, gross margin, and just about any metric you want to bring up.  It was a terrible quarter.  Of course it was!  Who in their right mind was thinking that April was a good time to buy a car?  And yet, TSLA somehow was virtually unaffected.  In fact, their revenue and gross margin actually WENT UP in Q2, 2020.  Isn't that amazing?  This company had its best quarter ever!  How did that happen?  Did COVID create some sort of environment where people said, ""That's it!  I'm switching to a Tesla!""  Did it?  Interestingly, in Q2 we saw record low prices for Oil (and gasoline).  So you would think this would disincentivize people from buying an electric vehicle.  At the very least, it would make the cost savings more or less irrelevant.  And yet, TSLA is telling us, quite the contrary.  Despite gas prices cratering to a 5-year low in Q2, below $2/gallon across the USA, people were seemingly buying Teslas while stuck inside their houses!  I think you see what I'm getting at here.  Tesla's numbers seem *real* fishy.  Their relative outperformance compared to their peers in Q2 this year is a major anomaly.  And their valuation compared to the rest of the automotive industry is inexplicable."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1423012|public|confidence|self|||TSLA's Q1 and Q2 vs. Competitors|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iedvdj/tslas_q1_and_q2_vs_competitors/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-08-22|GM

The trial with the NAID gives this HGEN alot more credibility as they have recognized them as a promising therapeutic candidate to treat COVID-19.     Nasdaq uplisting. On July 6th HGEN filed their Nasdaq listing application with the SEC. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1293310/000121465920006149/r762018k.htm  -  Uplisting usualy takes between 5 to 6 weeks. https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/initialguide.pdf .It has currently been a bit over 4 weeks. This will be a major catalyst for the stock as it will give it alot more notoriety and investor confidence. Just look at the interest in this thing while still trading over the counter.   Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, Surveyor Capital, etc.. Many of the bigger players may start taking positions once the uplisting occurs. From a retail standpoint HGEN cannot even have its own page on the stocktwits yet and can't be traded through Robinhood yet, so may be relatively on known to this crowd.      Positions 5000 Shares - sorry can't post options you cant trade options here yet   TLDR: HGEN has a promising therapeutic in the fight against COVID-19. Support from some of the big investors in the biotech space and a recently announced trial with the NAID using  Lenzilumab in combination with Remsdesivir. Nasdaq uplisting may be imminent. Since this still trades OTC you have the opp to front run the big boys for once."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1400911|public|confidence|self|||HGEN - double catalyst play|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6wamo/hgen_double_catalyst_play/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-08-10|GM

INTC is only up 8% from yearly lows, and severely underpriced in my opinion, and see serious runway in the next few months back up to February highs of $65-$68 ‚Äì options are cheap as well with IV only at 40% in most cases.   **Earnings and Revenue Beat**   Q2 earnings were up 16% and revenue was up by over 20%, despite COVID. The stock dropped admittedly as people looked to delayed 7 nano-meter processors until 2022, which isn‚Äôt great (AMD‚Äôs is in market), but people have overlooked their core revenue drivers that supported earnings beat in the pandemic. See the chart below from last week ‚Äì the 13% drop in the stock only puts it closer to support at around the $55 level.    &amp;#x200B;  **Things to Consider:**   ‚Ä¢	Intel is the worlds largest chip maker, and boasts high return on assets by free cash flow   ‚Ä¢	Intel is still a high growth company ‚Äì namely in revenue and free cashflow.

I have received  questions such as: where do you think it stops, is it over valued, undervalued, should my mom invest, should i Yolo, should i sell and take profits?  blah, blah blah.  Here is some DD- stop asking me about where this ends up because I don't know for sure but I have some Feely Good estimates. I hope this post makes your nipples hard and if it doesn't you're probably a gay bear.  I am going to give you a quick run down of what my expectations are for Q2 earnings and it will include the good, the bad and the ugly. The ugly being the warrant accrual that will hurt GAAP.  First of all, There is little that needs to be determined for Q2 top-line as they have already released April and May Sales. April Sales Came in around \~62M based on my math and May Sales came in at 88M and some change. Based on these numbers, we can safely assume that we will at a minimum have somewhere around 225M in revenue for the quarter by using the average of April and May to determine June. I believe 225M to be on the low side and I have continued to up my estimates as I believe E-commerce is still thriving, especially purple. Purple continues to climb the web traffic ladder and has moved up another \~500 spots to be the 13,000 most popular site in the world.  &amp;#x200B;  For simplicity sake, I am going to use some historical numbers to estimate profits. If you'll look at previous posts that I've made then you'll see how I arrived at these numbers. There are some quick napkin calculations below. We can safely assume that the average wholesale selling price of a mattress is \~1350 dollars and we can assume that GM for wholesale is around 30%. This means the average cost of a mattress to manufacture is \~945 on average. From my previous posts, we knew that pre Covid the business was split by units, not by gross sales. On average, wholesale consumed 50% of capacity and DTC consumed 50% of capacity. In order to determine average DTC selling price then we can equation **.5\*1350 + .5\*(DTC Price) = 1900**. PRPL indicated their average selling price per mattress was \~1900.00, I found this in their s-3.  \-----------------------------------  .5\*1350 + .5\*(DTC Price) = 1900=========== **DTC average price is 2450.00, 1350 is average Wholesale price.**  DTC Margin is **\~62% Estimated**  Wholesale Margin **\~30% Estimated**  \----------------------------------  Historically, advertising costs have been about 30% of revenue.  I have been tracking advertisement for purple and from a TV cost standpoint, they have not increased their commercial count at all in the last three months. See link, PRPL is still only performing 125 commercials per day. This commercial rate has held steady for 6 months.  [https://www.ispot.tv/brands/tqU/purple-mattress](https://www.ispot.tv/brands/tqU/purple-mattress)  &amp;#x200B;  I believe purple has increased their ad spend online but I believe it will be proportional to their new capacity on a unit basis.  Previously purple had 6 Machines of capacity and spent 38M in advertising, I believe they will spend (7/6)\*38M which is 44M or roughly **15M per month. Just because revenue is up, doesn't mean they will spend more per unit- they are capacity constrained and that is terribly inefficient.**  \----------------------------------  **The following table shows my best guesses on their major category costs. This includes the gross Margin and the other costs subtracted from the Gross Margin.**  ||April|May|June (Est)|Total Revenue net revenue effect| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Gross Margin from Wholesale|6M\*30%|17.3\*30%|20M\*30%|$**13M**| |Gross Margin from DTC|56M\*62%|71M\*62%|55M\*62%|$**112M**| |SG&amp;A Costs|(3.5)M|(3.5)M|(3.5)M|**($10.5)M**| |Research and Development|(1)M|(1)M|(1)M|**($3)M**| |Advertising|(15)M|(15)M|(15)M|**($45)M**| |Profit Non GAAP|\-----------|\-----------|\---------|***66.5M or 1.23 EPS***| |Warrant Accrual||||**($35M)**| |**Profit GAAP Estimated**||||**$31.5M or .59 EPS**|  \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If we used 66.5M, PRPL would report 1.23 EPS on an adjusted Basis.  The warrant Accrual will unfavorably push the EPS down on a GAAP basis and we will likely see something around .59 EPS. If they can achieve this for the next 4 quarters then in a years time there is a huge potential for stock increases based on the following P/E's.  &amp;#x200B;  ||GAAP est.|Non GAAP Est.| |:-|:-|:-| |**EPS Annualized**|**$2.36**|**$4.92**| |Stock price assuming 8x P/E|$18.88|$39.36| |Stock Price assuming 12x P/E|$28.32|$59.04| |Stock Price assuming 15x P/E|$35.4|$73.8| |Stock Price assuming 20x P/E|$47.2|$98.4|  &amp;#x200B;  People may say that this is super inaccurate..... but if you look at the following cash statement then you will realize that PRPL has been generating more than 1M per day in cash for the last two months - that is absolutely insane.  &amp;#x200B;  [purple has generated 70M in cash in 60 days.](https://preview.redd.it/tgcjjyf2o3e51.jpg?width=1246&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9d8d8e7fecae86e7e19b6a35b190d6b3ce23ba)  Mark my words, PRPL is going to be more profitable than TPX this quarter. TPX reported earnings of .68 EPS today on revenue of 665M. TPX is trading at 80+ per share. if purple reports a similar .68 EPS then it would be valued about 60% lower than TPX on an EPS basis. if purple posts EPS of \~1 dollar then it would be undervalued as compared to TPX by about 80%.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope your NIPS are tender now. Hope this helps you understand why I believe PRPL to be so undervalued."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1379307|public|confidence|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LoOfQpBHwDV_YgcSQXul5JCwTEX5HFYzi4qSSkl4Er4.jpg|62.0|140.0|PRPL Nurples- Why purple valuation just might make your NIPS hard - DD inside|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '5U7XWJu2AW8dpN-gaZec_b5gL0M05qkUMl1eKoxpzWI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/OSBI866Ygi6LKrTPzVyOXBL5dMPC9YIN68zi0xk0ohM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=780a0cd30cb72f18cabbdf15754ebcc96fb3cee9', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/OSBI866Ygi6LKrTPzVyOXBL5dMPC9YIN68zi0xk0ohM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a376bec8a6681efd80f805ec2e87a2724cc348', 'width': 216}, {'height': 179, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/OSBI866Ygi6LKrTPzVyOXBL5dMPC9YIN68zi0xk0ohM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9392edcf250587f26effe465fd85f2040d86a0b7', 'width': 320}, {'height': 359, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/OSBI866Ygi6LKrTPzVyOXBL5dMPC9YIN68zi0xk0ohM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad2e7234b40cf960ff2907ebceff9a567406f394', 'width': 640}, {'height': 539, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/OSBI866Ygi6LKrTPzVyOXBL5dMPC9YIN68zi0xk0ohM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d02ccf9bdaff8a1402d56bee7da3de18ea712333', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 562, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/OSBI866Ygi6LKrTPzVyOXBL5dMPC9YIN68zi0xk0ohM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=47a62a572a63568239f1c7519e38d37c3e3c1af5', 'width': 1000}, 'variants': {}}]}|#cc5289|light||||6688b7e6-0d2e-11ea-8964-0e8a0565e62d||||||2020-07-31|GM

Is anyone playing Ford or has played Ford in the past? After their last 4 earnings the stock has always moved down regardless of beating earnings. 3/4 times the move was greater the 5%. The IV rank is the lowest it has been in weeks so options are relatively cheap. Only down side is the fact the stock has been beaten down a lot. I'm thinking of buying of some puts with some time in them. Please tell why this is dumb move.

This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 7/15 TSLA 1250p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.  I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only features in the room are what I assume to be a Model X and a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, TSLA 2000. P/E exceeding infinity.  I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell and Elon Musk step in front of me. I try to speak up but Powell cuts me off. ""What am I-""  ""Why did you short Tesla Motors?"" he asks.  ""Huh?"" I respond, confused.  ""Why did you short Tesla Motors?"" he demands, louder this time.  ""I, uh... the market cap is higher than Ford, Toyota and GM combined.. It's not sustainable! It's-"" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.  ""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short Tesla?""  Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. TSLA has climbed to 3000. Impossible, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 50 percent and they can't sell that many cars!"" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Trillions in investment grade bonds from Tesla. Loans to Liberty University. Loans to Goldman Sachs  ""Repeat after me: Tesla only go up,"" Powell and Musk demand in unison.  I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, TSLA has climbed well over 5000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.  Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short Tesla Motors?""  I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""Tesla market cap can't exceed all automotive industries in the world! GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.  ""Tesla only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows TSLA has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 10000 in the dust, making new all time highs.  The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.  ""Tesla only go up,"" I say.  Shamelessly stolen from SA's Doomsday Economics thread. I mean, I made this."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1338679|public|confidence|self|||A real life story about Tesla|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hqofq0/a_real_life_story_about_tesla/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-07-13|GM

I think it is more than a $1200/share company, and this is my optimistic justification.  1. Tesla has more or less consistently maintained a decent gross margin, usually higher than most other automotive companies. They‚Äôve mostly been in the position where they could be consistently profitable if they only focused on existing products. They‚Äôve seen a huge expansion in the last few years, outfitting and growing the Fremont factory, Nevada‚Äôs factory, Buffalo, and Shanghai, as well as dozens of other small operations around those areas. Germany is coming up, Austin soon, ramping up design, manufacturing, and business employees for new products in automotive, solar, stationary storage‚Ä¶ all that and a consistently increasing revenue, and still people say ‚ÄúThEy LoSt $0.20 PeR ShArE ThEy‚ÄôRe HeMoRrHaGiNg MoNeY‚Äù 2. Electric cars are better. More power, way fewer moving parts, lower total cost of ownership, and there are also mandates by many countries to go all EV. You say that GM and Toyota will start making electric cars and take their share? Car companies are bureaucratic design-by-committee dinosaurs afraid of anything but incremental change. They will forever be one step behind with a worse car that nobody is excited about. People who own Tesla cars love them, and people who don‚Äôt own them want one. Ain‚Äôt nobody excited about the next Corolla. Ain‚Äôt nobody give a fuck what loaf Fiat is pinching off next year. Fifteen years from now Tesla will absolutely be worth what Toyota is worth, and probably also a couple other auto companies that won‚Äôt make it. $285B 3. Self driving is coming. Probably not tomorrow, but within the timeframe of investment consideration. Self driving is a data problem, and Tesla has fuckloads more data than anyone else. More than they know what to do with. If a car can safely drive itself, the car manufacturer isn‚Äôt going to sell those cars to Uber. They‚Äôre going to start their own app and slide the entire market cap of ride sharing companies into their own. $100B 4. In a few months, it‚Äôs speculated that Tesla will announce its million-mile battery. This is important for a couple of reasons. It will help them take over the trucking industry with a far cheaper per-mile product ($40B). It also allows the cars to be used for stationary storage. You don‚Äôt need a 400 mile range every day. You almost never need it. Plug in your car at night and charge it up with cheap electricity. Drive to work and plug it in and set your car to sell back some energy at peak hours. This is what some people are speculating battery day will be about. You need what, 15 miles of range to get home? Sell the rest, make some money. Tesla will take something like 30% just like Apple does when you sell an app. Their $40,000 car now has a total cost of ownership less than a $20,000 gas car. You gonna buy a Tesla or a Kia Forte? If this happens, Tesla sells fuckloads more cars, and makes fuckloads more money as an energy selling middle man. 100B 5. Short shorts. 0.005B 6. Stationary storage and solar. Nobody making batteries like Tesla making batteries, and their solar is getting cheaper and growing rapidly. I‚Äôm tired of typing, you're tired of reading. $75B  $600 Billion dollar market cap. $3250 share price.  But what about Ghislaine Maxwell? And what happens when NIO steals all their secrets? What about Elon‚Äôs obviously deteriorating health and the fact that his brother is 2/3rds lizard person? If those things are worrying you, literally reevaluate your entire life.  ‚ÄúYou make a compelling argument BonerballsDickfart, but they haven‚Äôt actually done any of that yet.‚Äù Yeah, no fucking shit, investing isn‚Äôt about what‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs about what‚Äôs going to be done. For years, the question was whether or not Tesla could survive and deliver. They just made it through a global pandemic better than any other car company. Investors are realizing all this shit is coming, and that‚Äôs why the stock is shooting up. Am I wrong? Possibly. I did just write 800 words to a subreddit that can‚Äôt be bothered to read the bottom of a Snapple bottle cap. I also probably overdid the addy this morning and I haven‚Äôt taken a shit in two days. It‚Äôs also possible that Elon goes full Howard Hughes, starts pissing in milk jars, names his kid something nonsensical and endorses Kanye West for president.  But what are the odds of that?

Will moniter throughout the next few weeks to see if this is a long buy or if i will short, as china has a new swine flu with pandemic potential and has been opening and closing cities still due to corona which is beneficial for ecommerce. They are similar to Alibaba but sell memberships as well and use members to promote products effectively cutting ad cost.

I believe the stock will rise next week as crude oil prices should drop, especially if airlines will plummet as predicted.  *Second sight (EYES)* entered @ $1.01 x 200 shares  Will probably hold this for a while. I bought this as kind of a troll one night when i was drunk cause i read a bunch of stories about people getting their eyes shot out in the riots..... and yes they make bionic eyes... no further comment  **Long holds:** most of these are self explanatory, bought into most of these ~1 month ago.dd1ppp *General Electric (GE)* *Cinemark(CNK)* *General Motors (GM)* *Docusign* *Teledoc* *Square*  *Delta*: might sell this tomorrow and reenter at better price points once airline stocks drop next week.  *Albertson's (ACI)* presented with IPO last friday at $16, IPO was originally valued at $23-28.

WSB consensus is that this is overvalued, a bubble based on astronomical P/E. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but this look at P/E or P/S is very misguided and misses the relevant drivers of valuation entirely. In fact it's a criminally bad fundamentals analysis. The error comes in the form of investments being put in the 'wrong' place on the financial statements, on the income statement hurting earnings, when in your DCF they should really be capitalized on the cash flow statement.   Definition:  Growth-stage company: A company which is reinvesting all or a significant majority of its earnings in order to generate more growth through capital investments, R&amp;D, or SG&amp;A. Within growth stage, we have companies whose investment takes the form of infrastructure and capital investment (early Walmart), and companies whose reinvestment takes the form of hiring engineers, salespeople, and product managers (early Facebook).  A mature company: A company which is partially or totally focused on increasing earnings, and achieves this through some smart reinvestment of earnings alongside significant cost-cutting measures. Examples include pretty much any CPG company.   Companies which are capital intensive are required to generate earnings on the income statement so that they have actual money to reinvest in land, buildings, and equipment. If early Walmart had not generated cash flow, they could not have built more stores and they could not have grown. A very high P/E ratio would have signaled that the earnings potential was incompatible with the expectations baked into the stock price.  On the other hand, if investment takes the form of personnel, there is no need to actually generate earnings on the income statement in order to grow. Just enough cash + earnings to buy minimal equipment (can be very close to zero in the age of AWS), and the rest is spent on income statement expenses, and there does not need to be anything left over. Add in stock-based comp and this earnings can go negative while the cash position remains healthy. So if you take a P/E on this kind of company you get a nonsensical result. If I were a CEO at this kind of company I would try to sandbag earnings as long as possible so my stock-based comp can over time expand significantly resulting for large rewards for myself and my employees while suckers missed out on the opportunity. (Bill Gates has actually admitted to doing this).  Looking at Zoom specifically, best metric to use is a DCF on gross profit less steady-state operating costs. Looking at purely a gross profit multiple we have around 100x, which will fall to around 30x-40x in just 12 months based on a growth rate of 150% and then further. We can say right away it's not a grossly overvalued company. Looking at where it traded pre-covid, it's potentially overvalued by a factor of ~2, and it could in fact be undervalued.  The drivers of valuation here are solely around the competitive landscape (Microsoft Teams being the biggest, also Zoom's current advantages/disadvantages factor in here), and the long term TAM of video-conferencing, as well as the 'stickiness' of the product -- this last one is especially important. Essentially these factors and the interplay between them will tell you whether this stock is overvalued or not. Zoom's GM is very strong which indicates a very strong business, and can't go up significantly from here. But fundamentally it's a very profitable business assuming that the aforementioned factors above can remain in its favor.   I wouldn't be a buyer here given that the FAANG companies are gunning for it and I expect them to succeed eventually(stickiness determines tail value in the DCF/acquisition value and my belief is that it won't be great, but this is a model sensitivity), my advice is that it's not a short based on either fundamentals or momentum. There is no catalyst and there is no solid short thesis.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1277185|public|confidence|self|||A primer on valuing publicly traded growth-stage companies.|0.0|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9lzrg/a_primer_on_valuing_publicly_traded_growthstage/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-06-15|GM

An explaination of CACC's accounting methods courtesy of [Matthew Greenberg - @greenycapital over on Twitter](https://twitter.com/greenycapital/status/1271197048574967808):  ""Over the next few weeks I‚Äôll be rolling out some threads on CACC as we approach the end of what could be a company altering quarter. This is the first of those threads, and it is going to be about ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù and ‚Äúeffective yield‚Äù interest method accounting. Historically ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù and ‚Äúeffective yield‚Äù amortization have been used primarily as ways of, in the most accurate way possible, reflecting interest earned on a bond purchased or sold at a discount to fair value. The system works like this:  A purchaser (or seller) of a discount bond records a loans receivable (loan payable) amount on the balance sheet equal to the $ paid (received) for that bond. Over time, that bonds value is increased such that at maturity, the bond‚Äôs book value equals its par value. This can be done through straight line amortization, but doing so does not take into account the compounding interest rate an investor earns/company pays by buying/selling that bond. Level-yield and effective yield accounting do by calculating a YTM for the bond and amortizing. By applying that YTM to the book value of the bond to calculate interest income/expense. As the BV  grows towards par value, the interest income/expense grows proportionally, thus more accurately representing the true yield the investor/seller receives/pays over the bonds life.  CACC uses level/effective-yield in a different way. Pre-CECL, when CACC purchased a loan from a dealer they record a receivables balance equal to the advance paid for the loan and an ‚Äúaccretable yield‚Äù balance equal to the company‚Äôs expected collections net of the advance. The amortization of that ‚Äúaccretable yield‚Äù was done by applying the level-yield to the loan‚Äôs carrying value the same way it‚Äôs done in a typical bond amortization. The problem? This practice does not accurately reflect the reality of CACC‚Äôs business the way it does for others.  CACC purchases a loan for their purchase program with $200 of contractual payments owed over 5 years for $100. They expect to collect $150 of that amount. They record a loan receivable balance of $100, and an accretable yield balance of $50 to be amortized over those 5 years. They assume $30 of payments in each year and calculate a ‚Äúlevel-yield‚Äù of 15.2% to maturity. In the first period, CACC will record accretion of $15.22 no matter how much they actually collect from the borrower. They then net out the remainder of the collections as principal. If there‚Äôs a collection shortfall, CACC takes a provision equal to that amount (even if expected collections over the loan‚Äôs life don‚Äôt change), and adjusts the accretable yield to equal (AY at start of period 1 - accretion + provisions + net change in forecast). At that point, CACC recalculates their expected collections and adjusts the yield. If collections were in-line, and expectations are stable the rate will be the same. If forecasts were raised, they will raise the level-yield to account for this; if not THEY DONT CHANGE THE YIELD That‚Äôs right, CACC uses the higher of the initial YTM and the calculated level yield. So let‚Äôs just assume collections go exactly as expected. What happens? CACC recognizes accretion of $15.22 in Y1, $12.97 in Y2, $10.93 in Y3, $7.47 in Y4 and $3.41 in Y5. Meanwhile, they recognize principal of $14.78, $17.03, $19.07, $22.53, $26.59 respectively in each of those years. See the problem yet? CACC is collecting $30 in each period, but recognizing $.51/$1 of collections in year 1, and $.11/$1 in year 5. Meanwhile, their credit risk grows (cars depreciate in value, so the underlying value of the collateral is declining even as contractual payments stay stable). So, CACC recognizes 56% of a loan‚Äôs accretable yield in years 1 and 2, but only 31% of the principal. It‚Äôs a mismatch. That‚Äôs fine if it was the other way around, but as is, CACC is recognizing revenue it has not earned yet. If collections come in lower than expected after those two years, they have to take a larger write-down on receivables because they overstated loan income in the first 2 yrs  So that brings us to today, where COVID is ravaging CACC‚Äôs loan book. They are seeing collections come in below expectations, when they‚Äôve already taken more in loan income  than they will earn over the life of the loan. This leads to massive provisions for losses. Meanwhile, the loans that are performing as expected are effectively non-performing loans, with receivables on the BS earning substantially less in accretable yield/dollar collected. Add on top of that the impact of CECL, which makes new originations a NI negative in year one. And CACC is essentially in earnings hell. Usually, they grow their loan book to offset the fact that all loan vintages are now earning less/$ collected than they did the year before as a result of level-yield, but with CECL that growth will be NI negative. The company is going to do their best to keep non-CECL provisions as low as possible, but given the amount of accretion they‚Äôve pulled forward, it‚Äôs going to be very hard to do that. How are lenders going to feel with revenue collapsing and provisions growing? Not good. Especially the lenders and senior secured bond holders, who are junior to the ABS holders in a liquidation event. The company had $25 mil of non-restricted cash on the BS at the end of Q1. I would not want to be a creditor watching earnings collapse even as collections stabilize.  That‚Äôs it for this thread, will be back with more periodically as I see fit over the next few weeks. Feel free to reach out with questions, I know it‚Äôs complicated and Twitter isn‚Äôt the best platform for this, but it‚Äôs the best option I‚Äôve got.""

Not only that, he is building a supermassive e-commerce platform so he will literally be rolling in hundreds of billions of dollars across India, Mexico, and the whole fucking world.  - call KSU. USMCA goes into effect July 1st you lazy idiots. The heavy materials, energy, and industrials relationship between Texas and Monterrey will only continue to grow dramatically in the upcoming months. Yes Tesla, Ford, GM, and all your fucking little EV parts will be exchanged between Mexico and the US.  - call NET. China can't build shit for themselves so they need Americans to come in and build their shit for real. This is why they fucking love Cloudflare filtered out web infrastructure to deal with their American Big Tech problem. Cloudflare lets them build some crazy shit out at scale. If you don't believe me then look at their relationship you stupid bitch  If you're a FUCKING üåàüêª but Panasonic STOCKS because you're a fucking pussy but enjoy the battery and green tech tendies|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1267023|public|confidence|self|||Can I post DD without getting filtered yet Sigh ...|0.0|[]|0.92|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0u6sw/can_i_post_dd_without_getting_filtered_yet_sigh/|no_ads|0|||||1591860886.0|||||||||2020-06-11|GM

With diamond hands and several dip purchases I held the 6/19 200p's through TSLA earnings at which point the original cost on 3/19 of \~$23 were sold off entirely at .75 per on 4/30. Some time with tanker gang, theta gang, and using and losing the stimulus check to buy a 6/19 WING $125p would bring it down further to a new rock bottom.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8dlondmcls351.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aca7832c0edffe7488c22e0cf14d972d9651db23  Rather than loathe myself for the rest of my life and regret not purchasing multiple discounted properties across Europe or SHOP calls and retire but remaining convinced the 2nd leg down was coming and that TSLA was due to revisit the Oct 2019 lows on poor guidance and a 2nd wave of CV and peak deaths and fully committed to bear gang, I'm going to attempt to climb my way back out, and get back to the high high's by TSLA 6/19 200p expiry. And as long as REITs and bankrupt companies are going up 20%-50% per day and printer goes brrr (my roth was similarly devastated by TSLA 6/19 200p's, but I do hold a single NKLA share, so), there seems no better time to go full YOLO and fight for what's right - J Powell to be nominated Time Man of the Year (somehow there are no odds listed for either J Powell or George Floyd but odds for BoJo) and win YOLO hearts and minds with reckless short expiry OTM calls.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/5udfka77ms351.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d8d0275eddeeb6ae7b850d5fedcbc32ecc157d2  To get there, I need to average approximately 40% daily returns each day from here to 6/19 - today was an 88% day, so I'm well ahead of progress - tough going against the PDT limits, but should clear that hurdle this week.

Including questionable longs like AMC and Hertz.  &amp;#x200B;  May 16, 2020 10:15 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News       The latest round of [13F        filings](https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/16/07/8248359/terms-of-the-trade-13f-filings) from institutional investors is out, revealing to the world        the stocks that some of the richest and most successful investors have        been buying and selling.       ### Takeaways From 13F Season   Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what        each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be        more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of        2020 was the worst first quarter in the history of the S&amp;P 500, so        investors were particularly interested in how top investors played the        dip.       &amp;#x200B;  * Fund managers were dumping FANG stocks in the first quarter with a          handful of exceptions. Tepper bought Netflix and Cooperman bought          Facebook        * Alphabet was one stock several fund managers were selling in the          quarter. Tepper, Cooperman and Soros all reduced their holdings.        * Einhorn and Ackman both bought Berkshire, while Buffett himself was          buying PNC Financial and little else.        * Bank stocks were popular among fund managers in the first quarter          after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0%. Einhorn bought          Goldman Sachs, Cooperman bought JPMorgan and sold Citigroup and Wells          Fargo, Buffett sold Goldman Sachs, and Soros sold Bank of America,          Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.        * Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes.          Rosenstein and Smith sold the SPY ETF, while Soros bought municipal          bond and investment-grade corporate bond ETFs.         Here‚Äôs a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most        popular stocks last quarter.       *See Also:* [*'I        Was Wrong': Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Sold $6B Of Airline        Stock In April*](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/05/15940613/i-was-wrong-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-sold-6b-of-airline-stock-in-april)   ### David Einhorn‚Äôs Greenlight Capital   Notable Q1 Buys/Increases:       &amp;#x200B;

WARNING: I am not about to say in this article that these companies will go up 30% tomorrow, like many here want. Please do not shitpost me because this isn't a sexy stock like TSLA or STNG. I called GM last week and was met with nothing but aggravated people (PM me if you want a link to my post on that, I made 130% return on that today.)   I am bringing to you tidings of a speculative investment opportunity. I have analyzed a few retail stocks that are doing well below their previous highs, most notably Nordstrom and American Eagle.    [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/coronavirus-nordstrom-is-preparing-to-reopen-its-stores.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/coronavirus-nordstrom-is-preparing-to-reopen-its-stores.html)    [https://commercialobserver.com/2020/05/nordstrom-to-shutter-16-stores-lord-taylor-to-liquidate-all-locations/](https://commercialobserver.com/2020/05/nordstrom-to-shutter-16-stores-lord-taylor-to-liquidate-all-locations/)    [https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/nordstrom-consensus-indicates-potential-48-8-upside/412822065](https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/nordstrom-consensus-indicates-potential-48-8-upside/412822065)    [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JWN?p=JWN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JWN?p=JWN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)    [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AEO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AEO)   Here are a few links surrounding the current events of these retailers, mostly JWN (I think they have the most potential).   As you will all notice, both of these retailers pass a basic stock screen with flying colors, healthy amounts of cash and little debt. I have been a long term value investor and have been keeping an eye on these two for an opportunity to get in. These companies are well run and were very financially healthy pre-crisis. Well low and behold I crossed that threshold and bought calls today. Both have earnings calls in the coming weeks and I see them as poised to rebound with the rest of the economy as we saw today I estimate that Nordstrom should see a 25-50% return in the coming and AEO about 20-40%.  This however is where the DD ends, I am not going to go over every aspect of each company, as I think that is what aggravated people last time. I will leave this up to you as the reader to look into and see if you found the same value as I did in this sector.

So as the title says I am bullish on GM coming out of the crisis, as we are reopening many sectors of the market have recovered and are starting to do pre-epidemic share prices again. I believe GM is best poised from a financial standpoint as it seems undervalued right now. Here is a link to GM current financial overview on Finviz.  https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d[GM financial overview](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)  And here is a link to their competition Ford who many on this sub know already went on a brief rally after earnings.  [Ford financial overview ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F)  Fiat- Chrysler are in the midst of a merger and are seemingly struggling to come to terms, as well as taking out more debt. They also have more European exposure which is not as good since several of those countries are still struggling to reopen.  Also most of GM sales come from China, USA which are both mostly reopened or in phase 1. [GM sales by country](https://www.statista.com/statistics/304367/vehicle-sales-of-general-motors-by-country/)  Finally, car sales are nowhere near as bad as what analysts thought they would be as Barron‚Äôs explains here: [Car Sales Data](https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/car-sales-stocks-auto-parts-dealerships-light-trucks-51589464899) The Detroit 3 are planning on reopening factories on Monday and sending all the unhappy workers back, in. [Detroit reopening](https://news.yahoo.com/amphtml/eyes-detroit-automakers-prepare-slow-113000251.html)  Conclusion: GM has healthier financials then the other Detroit 3 and are reopening their factories Monday. The general public will hear news of the factories reopening and GM will be on pace to succeed.    6/5 Calls $23  This is my first DD here on WSB let me know what you all think.

(SLS) is a late-stage clinical  biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer  immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications with TWO Phase 3  ready cancer vaccines : GPS and NPS. Both have proven to be safe and  well-tolerated and achieved very impressive results so far. Impressive  list of partners funding the ongoing trials.  GPS :  ‚Ä¢ 	In February 2020, SELLAS announced positive follow-up data from its  Phase 1/2 study of GPS in CR2 AML patients. The final data show a median  overall survival (OS) of 21.0 months, at a median follow-up of 30.8  months, in patients receiving GPS compared to 5.4 months in patients  treated with best standard care (p-value &lt; 0.02). GPS therapy  continued to be well-tolerated throughout the study.  ‚Ä¢ 	In February 2020, SELLAS announced the enrollment of the first patient  in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of GPS in combination with  Bristol-Myers Squibb‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (Opdivo¬Æ), in  patients with MPM.  ‚Ä¢	In January  2020, SELLAS announced that it commenced patient screening for its  pivotal Phase 3 REGAL study of GPS in patients with AML in CR2.  NPS :  ‚Ä¢ 	In March 2020, SELLAS announced preliminary antigen-specific immune  response data from a Phase 2 randomized investigator-sponsored trial of  NPS in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  (GM-CSF) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast  who are HLA-A2+ or A3+ positive, express HER2 at IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+  levels, and are pre- or post-menopausal. Preliminary data show an  11-fold increase in a CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes immune response in  patients who received a single dose of NPS compared to baseline. The  final data is being further analyzed by the National Institute of  Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the study principal investigator,  Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, MD, PhD of the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women‚Äôs  Cancer Center, and will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.  ‚Ä¢ 	In March 2020, SELLAS announced that final results from the efficacy  and safety data analysis of the Phase 2b independent  investigator-sponsored clinical trial of the combination of trastuzumab  (Herceptin¬Æ) +/- NPS targeting HER2 low-expressing breast cancer patient  cohorts, including patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),  were recently published in the peer reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer  Research. With regard to the TNBC patient cohort, the data analysis  shows:  \-  Disease-free survival  (DFS) landmark rate at 24 months for patients treated with NPS plus  trastuzumab (n=53) was 92.6% compared to 70.2% for those treated with  trastuzumab alone (n=44), a clinically and statistically significant  improvement.  \-  There was a  statistically significant reduction of 71.9% (p=0.01) in the frequency  of clinically detected recurrences in patients treated with the  combination (NPS plus trastuzumab) versus trastuzumab alone.  \-  The combination was generally well-tolerated and there were no clinicopathologic differences between the study groups.  ‚Ä¢ 	In February 2020, SELLAS announced that it had finalized the design and  plan for a Phase 3 registration-enabling study of NPS in combination  with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with TNBC in the adjuvant  setting after standard treatment, following feedback from a Type C  review with the FDA. SELLAS is actively pursuing out-licensing  opportunities to fund and conduct the future clinical development of  NPS.

They are led by a genius who has already beat Tesla once in a lawsuit over multiple patents and the numbers seem to point to an upwards trend.**  Okay boys and girls I am back and here to talk about Tesla‚Äôs ballbuster, VTIQ, or VectoIQ Acquisition. So you may be asking what this company is and let me give you a quick gist, VectoIQ is a holding company led by former **General Motors** vice chairman Steve Girsky. It has no real business of its own, but it has drawn a *lot* of interest from auto investors lately because of its plan to merge with Nikola Motors. VectoIQ's stock has had an especially strong run in the last few sessions, after the company confirmed in a series of regulatory filings that the merger is on track to close in early June.   Now lets go over some fundamentals of this company and its soon ally Nikola Motors. First of all this company is led by Steve Girsky. Girsky joined the board of GM in July 2009 as the company emerged from a U.S. and Canadian taxpayer bailout and bankruptcy. He was a key advisor to GM‚Äôs chief executives since before the 2009 bankruptcy. Girsky led restructuring efforts at Opel, GM‚Äôs primary brand in Europe, and pushed GM executives to embrace investments in digital technology and mobile internet connectivity that the company has now made central to its product strategy. In addition to being a board member, Girsky was GM vice chairman from March 2010 to January 2014, heading up GM‚Äôs global strategy during that time. He was the chairman of the Adam Opel AG supervisory board as GM struggled to bring Opel back to profitability at a time when some of his former counterparts on Wall Street thought GM should try to sell the brand. So basically this guy knows how to lead a company and more so assist a company in developing a brand and establishing a foundation even in the most troubled of times.  Now let's get into which companies hold VTIQ and can help in pushing this company higher. We have BlackRock with 2.2 million shares and Karpus with 2.3 million shares along with 37 other investment firms trying to enjoy the ride with VTIQ too, including a retirement fund too. Now the retirement fund is interesting since 95% of the time these funds try to go with safe investments because it is for the long run, so them investing in something like this means they know how little the downside is.  Now Nikola Motors is poised to be going into a brawl with the great all knowing Elon Musk, but thing is they have already won round one. Almost two years ago, Nikola Motors surprised the trucking market by filing a $2 billion lawsuit alleging that the Tesla Semi copied several design elements from the Nikola One, the truck-maker‚Äôs flagship hydrogen long hauler. News about the patent lawsuit has been scarce for over a year, but recent updates indicate that Nikola has snatched a small victory from the Silicon Valley-based electric car maker. Nikola‚Äôs case listed several characteristics of the One that were allegedly copied by Tesla. These included the Semi‚Äôs wraparound windshield, mid-entry door, front fenders, and the all-electric truck‚Äôs aerodynamic shape. To highlight its point, Nikola stated that the similar drag coefficient between the One (0.37) and the Semi (0.36) was further proof that the battery electric long hauler was copied from the hydrogen fuel-cell sleeper cab.   Excerpts from Nikola‚Äôs lawsuit pointed out that the Semi‚Äôs design had caused confusion among the One‚Äôs customers, diverting sales from the hydrogen truck maker to Tesla. Nikola also argued that these confusions might result in the Semi‚Äôs problems being attributed to the One, such as those resulting from Tesla‚Äôs batteries and Autopilot software.  Well here was the ruling on that: **Tesla loses bid to invalidate Nikola Motor patents in USPTO dispute. USPTO not only upheld Nikola semi truck's important patents but refused Tesla's request to modify our patents. Two billion dollar lawsuit moving forward. We will defend our company's IP no matter who it is.**  And last but not least let's get into the numbers. VTIQ has moved up significantly in the past month and is seeming to not be slowing down in any sense. With the MACD set to a 2.1 and 1.0 difference with the RSI being still lower than their previous March jump, they seem to have a huge jump left to be had. As of recently they had a 13 million volume which is still 5 million less than their highest volume level of 18 million so it seems like there is a lot of money left to be made.  Positions: $VTIQ June 19 $25 Calls, $DDOG May 15 $60 Calls  **TL:DR VTIQ is the next big jumper especially after their merger this summer with Nikola Motors.

One of their biggest backers are the **Agnelli family** ""the Kennedys of Italy."" who own the Fiat empire and Juventes football club (Former owners of Ferrari).  Not to mention the US department of energy was the first to give them a grant.  They have 10,000 pre-orders. Most of which were made by Anheuser-Busch to create a zero emission fleet in the next 5 years. These pre-orders include upgrade costs, software and hydrogen fueling infrastructure, worth 10B+ in product and service revenues.  The only thing you should be worried about is if this really is shell that they will do the reverse take over with.  My best guess is yes, considering the the current VTIQ CEO is an ex GM boss man with years of wisdom in automotive industry (Stephen J. Girsky).  Buy calls before June 5th.  Postions:  VTIQ 06/19 25c  VTIQ 07/17 30c  &amp;#x200B;  P.S. Before you go ape shit on the fact that VTIQ is trading on crazy multiples and that they only have 4 employees and its a fake company.

Position at the bottom.  Many moons ago I gave up trying to find a real job. After 20+ years in the restaurant industry I have come to realize that (at least in my local eyesight) that we are in for a big hurt. I have been a district GM in the past but my current role as GM of a 10 million dollar in annual revenue location in Toronto is leaving me with unease heading into 2021.  My restaurant and many others have been running skeleton crews for years now. Profits are tough to come by for most and most costs are already cut. My management staff is literally just me, two managers, a shift supervisor, and head office. Head office is mostly a numbers game though. They distribute payroll, set guidelines, set my ratios (labour %, food cost %, etc.), and they make me pay them to do this. After we payout head office, my location has a roughly 5-8% profit margin based on the past 5 years. This is awesome. We have a killer location and great staff.  *FYI - We pay head office a fixed percentage every year as they supply us with management staff and consolidate numbers for us. I am paid by head office, but the staff under me are not. ""Head office"" does this for dozens of restaurants as it is more efficient to scale up that aspect of the industry. This is why we pay them. It is a love/hate relationship.*  Anyways, here is the issue. Myself and a bunch of industry veterans in the area meet once a year at a bar to have a good time and share ideas on how to grow our businesses. Running a restaurant is a fairly political game with the local customers but we are all trying to make a living so we do work together. It is more common that you think.  **Actual DD -** We were supposed to meet in October/November when business started to dry up after summer, but before christmas season. We held an emergency meeting last week as most of us are just sitting at our restaurants alone in the dark finishing off the kegs with nothing else to do. Outlook is positive, but there is a very large hiccup coming that we are unsure what to do with. The bar industry (think clubs, divebars, cocktail bars) is a little more year round. But patio season for food-focused locations (think steakhouses, gastropubs, Applebees, etc) is the 3-5 months of the year where you actually crush your weekly breakeven targets and literally float the rest of the year. A breakeven target is what you need to make in a week, on average, to make money that week as long as you also hit your labour/food&amp;drink targets. Some places that number is 20k, some it is 300k. Mine is around 160k.  We budget to lose money in October, November, January, February, March, April, and sometimes May/September depending when summer starts or ends. December and June/July/August are what takes my location from -40% a year to +8%. That -40% is a rough guess by the way because I have never actually just not opened for summer because I like to feed my kids. Anyways, once we do open for summer - we are assuming is a cap on guests in the building and seating every other table we will only be partially back to normal. The issue is I need my restaurant to be full from right now to the end of August to be profitable for the year. There is absolutely no way this will happen.  Myself and my restaurant will be okay. Our lease is extremely high, but we can make it through to 2021. This is the problem though - we clear 5-8% profit after paying out head office. Most restaurants would kill for 2% - especially the smaller ones. I know dozens of small location owners as well as large location GMs who will not make it through 2021 to 2022. But it wont be realized until after summer. Most will scrape by on weak sales through summer. But trying to come back from literally 0 sales for a few months, then half those sales during the time of year that is supposed to make up for your lack of sales just wont happen, unfortunately. And this is the issue that will arise. The industry will be in a gridlock in 2021 financially, even if we are back to pre-pandemic levels of business and with no restrictions. There is a hole that is being dug and to come out of it, we will need to strip costs even further. I have a little room for this fortunately, but the vast majority do not. We already do food/bev costs down to the second decimal and this is common practice for most locations. That means when Karen thinks her well-done steak is too tough - the comp on that may actually be the whole days profit lost on a slow day in the winter. 100$ a day can truly be make or break in the slower months.  Side note - takeout means nothing for a sit-down restaurant. I have listened to so many podcasts and experts share their thoughts about what will happen with restaurants. They are all so far off the mark - especially considering some people actually think we can still turn a profit on just takeout alone. We can even sell beer with takeout in Ontario. But, when I am doing 20x my usual takeout orders on a Friday night. I am still not even coming close to the 40k in sales I need for that day. Pre-pandemic, takeout might do 150$ in sales on a Friday night. Now, it is 2-3k. But my lease is over 30k a month. I was already running a skeleton crew beforehand and we shaved down to literally just me, the chef, and one server who just wants the hours so he is deep cleaning the entire restaurant (money well spent imo).  These thoughts and numbers are mine, but they are shared among 30 other restaurant owners and operators and we are the majority of the restaurant/bar scene in Toronto. This long post barely scratches the surface of the issues that nobody really knows outside of the restaurant industry. The industry will not die. But many locations will turnover in 2021. Here is the kicker though - for the supply chains associated, this may actually be a positive thing. The food suppliers would love to have a new basket of people to sell goods too. People who dont have their menus optimized yet, and over-order to prevent shortages in the short term. Also to gain favor with the suppliers, they will be willing to spend money. This is provided there is enough liquid capital and people willing to jump into the industry to fill those gaps once the turnovers begin to happen.  **TLDR; Long SYY / Long dated puts on DIN,RUTH,QSR (Dec/Nov 2020 is not far enough, may need to wait).**   **CMG, SBUX, PZZA or whatever other fast/fast-casual places are NOT to be included in this DD.**  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: if you have questions about the industry, how it ***actually*** works, or what I think the future will be.

So, what does this mean? The US may ""flatten"" the curve, but not control the spread of the virus. In other words, the virus will continue to spread for the foreseeable future in an uncontrolled fashion (with an R0 value very close to 1 meaning daily new cases/death counts remain mostly the same). That  doesn't necessarily mean there will be another spike in infections (although that is possible).  Why is this? Well, here are the key differences between the USA and (most) other first world countries  1. Lack national contact tracing program  2. Insufficient testing - especially for rural communities 3. Insufficient PPE for hospitals and essential workers 4. Lack of national quarantine plan 5. A desire by a minority (\~5-10% of the population - anti-vaxxers and the like) to ignore most safety recommendations (masks, no visiting family, etc) - and no repercussions if safety recommendations are ignored 6. Reopening Super-spreader locations (Churches, factories, and Saloons) where spread can continue even with  7. A refusal by top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate an international response - Reduces the ability of countries to coordinate responses such as short term travel bans to hotspots, share PPE, share ventilators, share information, etc. 8. A refusal of top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate an national response - Reduces state-by-state differences and leverages the best scientists to create a baseline plan for the country. 9. Growing partisanship about the response creating a lack of a response (mostly noticeable in mask wearing). This increases the spread as many anti-vaxxer types see wearing a mask/social distancing as a ""liberal"" issue rather than a ""national"" issue, meaning the virus spreads more.  There are a lot of big economies (France, Germany, China, Japan, South Korea,  Italy, Australia, Switzerland, Spain, Netherlands, and Turkey) that have reduced the number of new infections to controllable levels.   [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (Click on the country in the left pane and click on the daily cases in the bottom right window).   Since the new infection rate is low, that means if they determine a person is infected, they can perform contact tracing on that person, determine who they were in close contact with, and then quarantine everybody who they were in close contact with. This can reduce the number of new infections by a significant amount (I'm guessing reducing the likelihood of another  infection by 75% - bringing the R0 value down significantly below 1) without social distancing efforts. There is no indication that the US will have any of this type of capability for at least 3 months. Probably closer to 6. The issue being a lack of national leadership. States may implement this, but many slow states such as Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Kansas may not have the resources or political will to get something like this going quickly.   Okay, so what does all this mean for businesses and stocks and investments.  If you live in one of these countries where new infection rate are low with contact tracing, you are free to go out and spend money without worrying about getting infected. Higher confidence = higher spending. Additionally, these countries are going to be looking to fully re-open their economies  (football games, bars, casinos, etc). With that, they'll be stuck between two options. One, keep their economy open to the US and risk a new outbreak (and thus the economic hit) or close their economy to the US and take the  economic hit until the US gets the virus under control. Essentially, a travel ban of people traveling from the US (and other countries that don't have the virus under control - Russia, Canada, UK, etc in that list) could be possible.   Another affect of this, which is more important for us, if the US has an uncontrolled spread of the virus, that means factories will be shut down at random (as an outbreak occurs in a factory) in the US for a period of 3-6 months where other country's factories are humming along. With a reduced demand rate, that creates a huge competitive advantage for other countries to provide reliable supply. That means that buyers of products will look for alternative supplies outside of US. This means that big businesses such as GM, BA, F, GE, etc lose long-term market share to competitors in other countries. This can hit other places such as  entertainment where no new US movies are produced, and no US sports are produced.   To me, this points to not just a slow L shaped recovery. It means that the GDP of the USA will be lower in 2021-22 than it was in 2019. Other countries (Japan, China, South Korea) could see a full recovery by the beginning of 2021.   Tell me I'm wrong. I really want to know if I'm completely off base here."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1181782|public|confidence|self|||Crazy prediction: COVID-19 will seriously hurt the US standing in the Global Economy|0.0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0k1r/crazy_prediction_covid19_will_seriously_hurt_the/|some_ads|7||||||||||||||2020-05-08|GM

Buying Put debit spreads until we start to trend back down.***   Executive Summary:  1.	The Federal Reserve balance sheet rate of additions has decreased as we have come out of the initial shock period 2.	Interest rates / Liquidity are the focus for the Fed, rather than the price of equities 3.	Consumer spending behavior has shifted, and we need to model these emerging changes in our 2020+ equities pricing 4.	Reopening of the US before adequate measures are in place introduces further market downside risk, with a new spike of cases building and presenting by Mid May 5.	Oil and other commodities are showing the supply and demand disruptions of the shutdown and present a volatility / market sell trigger in Mid May 6.	Remdesivir and other drug and vaccine developments are too optimistic and there is a high degree of downside risk if there are setbacks or failures  You don‚Äôt need a thousand words to know the economy is messed up right now. What Bears might need, after taking a pounding through April and getting jacked to the tits off the first smidge of red, is to tap the breaks a minute. A walkthrough of what to look for, what events are coming up, and how things might change throughout May.  1.	Federal Reserve Intervention ‚Äì how much has the Fed added to their balance sheet since the beginning of this crisis? Jan 20, 2020: 4.2 Trillion USD to ~6.7 Trillion today. Over the past month and a half, we saw the Fed add to their weekly purchases by up to 586 Billion USD (Mar 25th) dropping down to 82.8 Billion this past Wednesday. This change might be attributed to our moving past the initial liquidity crisis phase of the CV epidemic, and onto the solvency crisis phase.  Date	|Total Assets (Billions USD)	|Change from Previous Week (Billions USD) :--:|:--:|:--: 26-Feb-20	4158.6	-12.9 4-Mar-20	4241.5	82.9 11-Mar-20	4311.9	70.4 18-Mar-20	4668.2	356.3 25-Mar-20	5254.3	586.1 1-Apr-20	5811.6	557.3 8-Apr-20	6083.1	271.5 15-Apr-20	6367.9	284.7 22-Apr-20	6573.1	205.2 29-Apr-20	6655.9	82.8   2.	Interest Rates ‚Äì Negative yield on the US 10yr. means a world of further hurt for the economy, and retirees specifically. Negative rates have had a net negative effect on growth in other countries (Japan, European Union) and the US has so far avoided this phenomenon. A theory tying the rate of balance sheet additions by the Fed to the US 10yr. yield, would be the Fed is targeting a low but positive rate of ~0.60%, by setting the overnight lending rate (0.50%) and ensuring lending and liquidity in markets through balance sheet additions. With rates at 0.60% right now, and the goal to avoid negative for the time being, the Fed feels their objectives are satisfied and have held rates and slowed their additions.   In his speech on April 29th, Jerome Powell made an unusual and direct comment to Congress regarding the interventions made to date, and that they may need to intervene again, ‚Äúif the recovery is to be a robust one‚Äù. My takeaway from this: liquidity and interest rates are problems which the Fed can address. On the other side, a company can only operate so long without revenue, and it is in this arena that Congress must step up. The growing solvency crisis (CHK, HTZ, Any retail store) is something which is outside of the Fed‚Äôs ability to control ‚Äì they cannot print money, and even the junk bond ‚Äúspecial purpose vehicle‚Äù maneuver is borderline beyond their powers. I think the market should have taken Powell‚Äôs speech as a more desperate, starkly negative signal but either way I am convinced the Fed is not the unlimited money printing machine of lore, but rather the wrong institution with the wrong tools to tackle this crisis.         3.	Equities Market‚Äì No company was built to weather a crisis like this. Major changes in consumer behavior will develop. Already, we see savings skyrocketing as consumers are less inclined to spend, but there are many other potential economic changes which will change the makeup of our economy once things are ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù:   ‚Ä¢	More remote work might mean tech companies growth, but metro real estate‚Äôs demise ‚Ä¢	Restaurants have so many challenges ahead it actually makes me sad to think about  ‚Ä¢	Car usage has plummeted but there are further disruptions which this week rocked GM and F ‚Äì rental companies are at risk of bankruptcy. Hertz the focus now, but others are in a similar position. Tens of thousands of used cars flooding the market on a liquidation of Hertz would implode Detroit.  Just three examples‚Ä¶ Companies‚Äô revenues have been disrupted in a way which has never been seen. The future remains uncertain, but any further extension of lockdown, spike in cases/ deaths, means reduced earnings. Lower earnings, stock values which are still near ATH‚Äôs = P/E ratios that look even more overvalued (I won‚Äôt address the weakness of the global economy prior to the CV outbreak, but it is a critical part of our present situation).     4.	Reopening of US States ‚Äì herein lies the catch 22. Reopen states = end economic suffering, right? Well, you cannot demand that consumers spend. Consumers need to have faith and money to spend back at Jan 2020 levels. A reopen does not immediately solve this challenge, and a few weeks into May this will start to be obvious. To reopen, we needed see consistent reductions in new cases of Covid, a high degree of testing, and contact tracing. The magic formula. We lack this completely. US testing growth has stagnated. Just as the corona virus grew exponentially, so should our testing numbers have. Instead, we have flattened both curves, and set ourselves up for a massive failure. This is my key trigger for sharp selloff, as I believe it is the most concrete way to say, ‚Äúuntil the US government gets its shit together, or we have a vaccine/ treatment, the economy is broken.‚Äù   5.	Oil / WTI June Contract Expiration Approach ‚ÄìAgain, Macrovoices does a thorough job. In a nutshell: the market may misinterpret signals from the oil market in the next weeks, leading up to the middle of May. It currently appears we are not filling the oil capacity as quickly as thought, however, this is a due to floating storage (tankers) being utilized and storage at the WTI contract settlement location (Cushing, OK) being already at ‚Äúworking‚Äù rather than ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù max capacity. We cannot simply shut off production capacity from oil wells, since there is a huge risk to equipment and the health of the well itself, so it is not likely that we reduced crude production / increased consumption at the rate implied in this week‚Äôs storage utilization numbers. The dynamics involved here will play out as futures contracts near expiry, beginning potentially in the mid of May and leading up to the May 19th settlement date.    6.	Remdesivir ‚Äì Risk risk risk. More than any other news event, this drug and positive / negative announcements have massively swung prices. https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/1256242036015063042 Threads like these are a reminder that negative news on drug / vaccine development will be an instant trigger for the markets, up or down.  My positions: SPY 5/20 275/265 and SPY 6/5 270/260. Taking profits early. Keeping cash on the sidelines to be ready to roll my positions out and up if the rally goes higher. I am looking to get more aggressive with my puts as we approach the events I outlined above.  ***Key Indicators / Sources:*** Fed: 10 Yr.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.  # **April‚Äôs jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)** ***** &gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday‚Äôs dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history. ***** &gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession. ***** &gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,‚Äù said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. ‚ÄúI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.‚Äù ***** &gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb. ***** &gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. ‚ÄúIf they go well that‚Äôs a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that‚Äôll be a blow to confidence,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ***** &gt; # Best April in years Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987. ***** &gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. ‚ÄúNow there‚Äôs not that much to look forward to,‚Äù he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,‚Äù said Stovall. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. ‚Ä¶ Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April‚Äôs gains.‚Äù The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years. ***** &gt; # Virus economy Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter. ***** &gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. ‚ÄúThis is all a stab in the dark,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs not going to come down as quickly as it went up,‚Äù said Stanley. ‚ÄúBut I do think you‚Äôre going to see steady improvement. I think you‚Äôre going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.‚Äù ***** &gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said. ***** &gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work. ***** &gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think it could spook people,‚Äù said Schumacher. ‚ÄúIn the markets, we‚Äôve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.‚Äù ***** &gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday‚Äôs ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it‚Äôs unclear how quickly it can recover. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they‚Äôre allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI do think expecting we‚Äôre going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.‚Äù ***** &gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments. ***** &gt; # A new 20-year bond The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter. ***** &gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe supply announcement we think is significant because you‚Äôre going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,‚Äù said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter. ***** &gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**  *****  # US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession  &gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren‚Äôt stocking our refrigerators and pantries.  &gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit‚Äôs preliminary Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.  &gt; Today‚Äôs Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing‚Äîthe so-called official PMI‚Äîprovided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg‚Äôs consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; But that‚Äôs the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.  &gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,‚Äù said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. ‚ÄúGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we‚Äôve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.‚Äù  &gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter‚Äîpotentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).  &gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.  *****  # Global Central Banks All In  &gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAnd the market is seeing it. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.‚Äù  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity  &gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 ‚Äì 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.  &gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.  &gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.  &gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight the Fed‚Äù alive even in an age of zero rates.  *****  # Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition  &gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear ‚ÄúSell in May.‚Äù But when exactly in May is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May‚Äôs sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**  *****  # This is Still an Election Year  &gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.  &gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**  &gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.  &gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman‚Äôs historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**  *****  # 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot  &gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two‚ÄîUtilities and Financials‚Äîabove their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.  &gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.  &gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$SHOP**  &gt; * **$ROKU**  &gt; * **$DIS**  &gt; * **$TSN**  &gt; * **$CVS**  &gt; * **$BYND**  &gt; * **$PYPL**  &gt; * **$SQ**  &gt; * **$ATVI**  &gt; * **$W**  &gt; * **$UBER**  &gt; * **$SRC**  &gt; * **$PINS**  &gt; * **$MRNA**  &gt; * **$REGN**  &gt; * **$L**  &gt; * **$JBLU**  &gt; * **$GOLD**  &gt; * **$ENPH**  &gt; * **$SWKS**  &gt; * **$SPCE**  &gt; * **$RACE**  &gt; * **$TTD**  &gt; * **$WAB**  &gt; * **$GM**  &gt; * **$PTON**  &gt; * **$ALK**  &gt; * **$ZNGA**  &gt; * **$TEVA**  &gt; * **$SYY**  &gt; * **$OXY**  &gt; * **$WYNN**  &gt; * **$NEM**  &gt; * **$PLUG**  &gt; * **$TWLO**  &gt; * **$TREE**  &gt; * **$LYFT**  &gt; * **$TMUS**  &gt; * **$WING**  &gt; * **$INSG**  &gt; * **$CHGG**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/fFKeAlB.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/gSYI5N4.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 5.4.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/prLXepG.png))   &gt; # ***Monday 5.4.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jw2RTuJ.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7mAza6O.png))   *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 5.5.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mscKzT0.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Tky4XEa.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 5.5.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gdB37XQ.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xGfgbcX.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/bpE2fWG.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 5.6.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/W6XbJBI.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JZwMlr5.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 5.6.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Vhn1mi6.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hp7xyEA.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/UHwESXC.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/4oIA9f4.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 5.7.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ndodqdm.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/q3GjlwY.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/CH3tis0.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 5.7.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6NNcgwo.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/39e93bE.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Qxeu7FU.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PPwVvFj.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 5.8.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vmioO0H.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 5.8.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ohuyRuS.png)) NONE.  *****  # Shopify Inc. $613.64 &gt; **Shopify Inc.

Chief Executive Elon Musk is close to getting a windfall that would dwarf any payday for star Silicon Valley executives as the electric-car maker predicts it could reach a key milestone within months.  As MarketWatch reported in January, as part of a performance-award agreement in Musk‚Äôs 2018 compensation package, the Tesla TSLA, -2.62% CEO stands to receive options to purchase shares if Tesla reaches certain benchmarks, an important one being a market capitalization averaging $100 billion for six months.  Tesla‚Äôs market value is currently at $143 billion, nearly seven times the market value of Ford Motor Co. F, +3.38% and four times that of General Motors Co. GM, +0.46% The six-month average is around $97 billion.  Related: Tesla stock is riding high as investors wait to hear effects of coronavirus  Tesla predicted that it will hit that $100 billion market-cap milestone within the next two months, ‚Äúif the value of Tesla‚Äôs closing stock price continues near the levels seen in late April 2020,‚Äù the company said in a filing Tuesday.  After the Tesla board certifies the $100 billion market cap average, then Musk would have the option to buy about 1.7 million shares at $350.02 a share. Selling them at Tuesday‚Äôs prices would mean a paper profit around $725 million for Musk.  By comparison, Google‚Äôs parent Alphabet Inc. disclosed last week that Chief Executive Sundar Pichai‚Äôs total compensation for 2019 topped $280 million thanks to stock awards tied to his promotion to chief executive of the entire company.  Tesla shares have shown resilience amid the economic destruction caused by the coronavirus, even as San Francisco Bay Area authorities have extended through the end of May a regional shelter-in-place order that has kept businesses, including Tesla‚Äôs sole U.S. car-making plant, shuttered since late March.  The shares have gained 85% so far this year, contrasting with losses of 11% and 15% for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 0.08% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, 0.28%  That outperformance holds in a 12-month comparison as well, with Tesla shares up 230% while the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.4% and the Dow lost 9%. On Feb. 19, Tesla‚Äôs stock reached a record closing high of $917.42.  Tesla is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday, with investors keeping an eye out for any changes on Tesla‚Äôs goal to sell more than half a million vehicles in 2020.

They don't use gas, yeah that's already ""priced in"". Well what else happens when people don't use their cars... they don't repair them. Less people get in accidents, less people need an oil change.

I was doing some DD on this lovely evening after watching ‚ÄúThe Big Short‚Äù for about the 5th time. I was inspired by the Mortgage Based Securities bailout of the Financial Crisis and was trying to find something that had not been touched by the Fed‚Äôs outstretched arms.   I happened upon the auto market. Yes, one might say, ‚Äúbut sir papa Powell already issued asset backed securities in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).‚Äù I would say you are quite right, but what about the upcoming demand for future vehicles.  Sure airlines, hotels and cruise lines will have a hard time getting demand back, but what about the purchase or lease of a car? That is a major purchase that I don‚Äôt think many autists are willing to acquire in the foreseeable future.   With that, I did some research and found out that GM Financial revenue is about 3% of revenue for GM which I know doesn‚Äôt sound like much but it‚Äôs about 4 billion in total revenue. So, I thought if people lease less cars it‚Äôs going to hurt GM‚Äôs bottom line, right? And worst comes to worst demand will surely decrease for direct selling of cars so GM will be hurt.   But then I remembered about my King in DC, Jerome H. Powell. He told me one time that stonks only go up and that he will print ungodly amounts of money to make sure that happens.    I have come to the conclusion like many autists that it is an univestable US equity market and that the best move is to get out now. But I will continue to buy my $SPY 9/30 275p and kill myself, but what‚Äôs an autist to do?|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1119755|public|confidence|self|||GM and the dumbass Fed|0.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4km4t/gm_and_the_dumbass_fed/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-04-20|GM

If y'all listened to me yesterday for Alteryx you could have made a pretty penny but the real dollars are to be made closer to earnings in early May, no worries if you missed that play, we'll see some ups and down between now and then.  **What's your Gay DD?**  So here comes the diarrhea that I'm going to squirt into your collective mouths about the next play. And you've heard it a million times before. Good ole' TSLA. What do I have to say that hasn't been said before? Market Cap that would make Enron blush? Meme stock owned by retards on RH who buy the first stock they think about while blowing loads to Elon? Played out.  No, this is a lot more boring than that. We're going into some stupid numbers, with actual facts and assumptions. Shitty and gross I know.  Earnings are next week on Wednesday, and no I don't care about the people who claim earnings won't matter because of the economic climate or that TSLA exists on a plane on existence that surpasses the need for regular financial reporting. When your stock is on some sort of retard strength rampage, a good old earnings miss if sweet sedative flowing into your bloodstream. This isn't going to help the people that shorted a long time ago, Tesla has way too much Cash and some decent cash flow to really be a Going Concern here, they are fine.  But 750$ fine? No way. I see us at least going back to 550-500. The Puts are cheaper than they may seem.  **Can I see the details behind your shitty DD?**  Maybe. I have this all together in some sort of really shitty excel file, feel free to DM for it. But we're going to play this by text.  A) Check their delivery numbers for Q1 (already out and crazily enough, this news didn't do anything to share price. Why? Because investors do not have the IQ required to interpolate the delivery numbers into implied marginal profitability numbers when real EPS goes out next week. )  [https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)  88,000 vehicles delivered, nearly 22k less than Q4 2020 (110K), (the one that kicked everything off). That's the play everyone, thanks for reading, I'll catch you at the Sandals in Aruba.  **My shit's all gay and I talk kind of retarded**  No my guy, that's not the play. Check the split. YoY from Q1 2019, they have failed to budge the numbers of their truly profitable vehicles they sold (they sold 12k X/S Models a year ago as well).  All of their growth has come from selling an extra 6,000 Model 3 (Maybe a few Y? they claimed to start delivering in March but this can't be a material balance) in this Quarter Year over Year. As I type this, I cannot believe I'm talking about $120B Market Cap Company, my DD is about what literally them selling a few thousand cars. Either way, they are not growing the segment that is driving profits. At all.  Your kids are going to be watching documentaries at school on the Tesla Bubble as investors realize just how high the market cap is given that both their top line and bottom line growth are likely done. (Not even taking into account we're entering a fucking recession where people don't buy cars, and oil is free, thus diminishing the push for actually electric vehicles).  **Plenty of others have called the Top for Tesla, what makes this different?**  I can guarantee two things,: Tesla will remain in business a long time. They have tons of Cash, and Debt that is more than manageable given their cash flows. Their cars are desirable by some and are status symbols. Elon has thrust the electric car into the mainstream, delivered on his promise to sell a 30kish electric car, and forced the rest of the industry adapt. Tesla really is a great success story. They worked their asses off for this.  And here's the other half of the promise. By 2022 shares will sit around 200 or so, probably less. (much less). GM, considered a flaming pile of dogshit by almost any standard, just wrapped up selling about 600,000 vehicles, and it was a baaad quarter. For them at least. Last FY they made $6 Billion in clean profit and gave all of it away in the form of buybacks and dividends. GM may be a pile of shit but they know how to sell cars (trucks and SUV's actually but that's another story) and make money while doing so, at least while shit kickers can still borrow to buy silverados n shit.  Tesla has been able to spin their narrative absolutely perfectly. They already thought of my argument, people will claim that they also have revenue in the energy or whatever the fuck. It represented 6% of their fucking revenue. Please.  **Oh boy this turned into more of some pyscho rant than DD**  It sure did. Buy LEAP puts in 2022 or if you're feeling cool, 4/24. If you believe that missed earnings can move the needle, do it. If not, LEAP. I'm much more confident about the earnings miss than the reaction to it. Again I can provide the shitty ass Excel, your call. Their non automotive revenue is super flat and predictable, so is SG&amp;A and R&amp;D, and even their margins, the huge drop in X/S model sales leaves a huge hole to bring Revenue down to what I see to be $5.5 Billion for Q1, my EPS Target is -.40.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1105097|public|confidence|self|||TSLA DD# 453,291|1.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1jrmx/tsla_dd_453291/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-04-15|GM

Nikola just got acquired by the SPAC VectorIQ ([VTIQ](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02OY1f8exIwvk5EhKnvfPr9y-DL-w:1586805642701&amp;q=NASDAQ:+VTIQ&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDdPMzDLMso3MeBax8vg5Brs4BlophIV4BgIAMDL5lkwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzjqTVj-boAhWQVc0KHe5oBZ0Q3ecFMAB6BAgQEBM&amp;biw=1800&amp;bih=1078)), which is managed by none other than GM legend [Steve Girsky](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/1524718), who served on GM's board of directors from 2009 - 2016. Shares of VTIQ are currently trading at $11.74 and will convert to the ticker symbol NKLA sometime soon.  To put this opportunity in context, Tesla IPO'ed at $17 per share. Now it's trading $641 fucking dollars per share.   Do you guys think Nikola has Tesla moon potential? Might be a couple years from now, which I know is difficult for you short-term-thinking-fucks to consider, but if so it's an absolute fucking steal at this price.

Those lessons are:  * Don't do what everyone else is doing, when people are buying sell when people are selling buy * Look for fundamentally sound companies, companies that have a high barrier to entry, and ideally market dominance * Ignore financial news, its too reactionary, pay attention to trends, and the news in general  In early February I started to pay attention to COVID19. I also saw some videos on how infectious the disease was, in addition I saw the drastic measures China took. This deeply concerned me as I knew shut downs as the one China imposed would have massive economic affects. I began to liquidate my positions. I had made very strong gains.  I then heard about the news what happened in Korea and I figured EVENTUALLY this disease would be worldwide, and I figured the longer countries waited to react the worst it'd get. So I started thinking about companies that would do well during COVID19. And here is my list:  * Amazon: People will still need products, more and more will  turn to eCommerce people still need products. * Netflix: I figure people will need something to do, this could be a good investment * Clorox: consumer brand that deals effectively with the disease. * 3m they produce a lot of PPE (honestly this wasn't my smartest play) * Kroger: I figured restaurants would be shut down however groceries will be in higher demand  I stayed away from healthcare stocks as I wasn't confident which one would benefit or which one would drop  Stocks I'm considering as this virus progresses  * Boeing: Its an American staple and it will be bailed out. * Ford/Chrysler/GM: Those are staples of the American economy who have taken big hits, they aren't going go anywhere. * Best Buy: They turned themselves around and have great leadership, obviously as consumer spending took a hit they went down but I'm confident in their ability to survive. * Expedia: Its ultimately a tech company that deals in Travel obvious due to COVID 19 they lost a ton in terms of value but I think  as we recover people will be looking to get out and travel. Since they are a tech company I'm confident in their ability to rebound. Although I'm sure many travel/hotel related companies may not survive, I'm confident Expedia will bounce back * American Airlines/Delta: They are American staples and even if they need to bailed out they will be. And one things resume to normal they'll bounce back and I feel as if they could be a good value.  My plan is in the next few weeks to buying positions in those above stocks. And hold.     I've made quite a bit of money on this outbreak by positioning myself, and truth be told a lot of its due to reddit.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1098481|public|confidence|self|||A lesson my grandpa taught my dad, who then taught me and how it paid off in a global pandemic|1.0|[]||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0cj60/a_lesson_my_grandpa_taught_my_dad_who_then_taught/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-04-13|GM

I do not know the exact date. It would be my best guess that this cash is going to be used to buy stocks, especially large caps. This is stock market positive.  Here is where this gets fuzzy. 1. Crude oil‚Ä¶ in order for a meaningful market move higher crude needs to be bid up. 2. The 10yr yield must not drop. In fact we need to see it move higher.  In summary. The Wall St. mega-banks will be getting huge amounts of capital directly from The Fed/WCB which is positive for stocks. We need crude to get bid higher, and we need to see the 10yr yield gain. If we see crude catch a bid, and the 10yr moving higher KNOWING the banks are getting WCB capital‚Ä¶ stocks will gain and it could be substantial.

SPY281 high yesterday is same as SPY 281 on 8/5/2019. Is our future global economic outlook/future profits as good as the outlook 8 months ago pre-COVID?  And more factually, 2nd order economic effects. With exception of travel and oil industry, right now job losses mostly focused on low paying service/manufacturing jobs that can't wfh .  Now with much larger sample size for COVID mortality rates, Trump and other democratic country politicians can't claim ""the cure is worse than the disease!"" 21% mortality among closed cases or even 6% mortality is unacceptable to voting public (assuming the 1.1mil active cases, many newly infected, all miraculously survive.)  Closed Cases 452,411 Cases which had an outcome:  356,673 (79%) Recovered / Discharged  95,738 (21%) Deaths  [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)  With no working cure or vaccine or even conclusive proof antibodies recovered COVID patients won't get reinfected again, the whole world is forced to lock down long term because each time a region loosens up, a new wave of COVID breaks out. Example: Hong Kong closing bars last weekend and China closing movie theaters after 1 week open despite them taking preventative measures against COVID since Jan, three months ago.  If USA and the world lock down for longer, esp past 2-3 months, 2nd order effects mean even with Fed QE, most industries will see sustained long term operating losses, which means mass layoffs of high paid workers and closure of small/medium cash strapped businesses, which will hit consumption/consumer debt defaults even harder, leading to vicious cycle of more layoffs/closures, more corps losing money, more layoffs just like 1929 or 2008.  We all know it's the high income folks who provide the bulk of the high profit margin consumption in the global economy, especially China new rich show offs buying up luxury markets.  And there's no escape for globalized SP500 corps, because whole world is shut down, there's no profitable region that can help lift up sagging regions.  This will also pop the new tech bubble momentum Unicorns such as WeWork, Uber, Lyft, Softbank Vision fund, AirBnB, SPCE, and \*gasp, maybe even Tesla. This will kill momentum retail and private equity buying sentiment.  And democrat controlled congress forcing companies taking bailout money to ban stock buybacks and very likely stopping dividends will simultaneously eliminate huge equity buyside support and increase selling pressure because the jobless former high earners can't depend on dividends for cashflow anymore but is forced to sell low to get cash to live or service debt/margin calls.  Oh, in 2008, bailed out GM/Chrysler/Bear Sterns/Merril Lynch/WaMu equity holders took 90-100% haircuts. It was the bond holders and workers who go saved. Any bet's this will repeat again, esp with a democrat controlled congress?  Fed right now is willing to buy up to 20% of Investment grade and junk (old or newly downgraded) bonds. But if or when long term lockdown 2nd order effects kick in, can Fed prop up entire breadth of USA economy long term? Even after stimulus funds run dry?  And even if Fed manages to prop up USA indefinitely through infinite QE, what about rest of world? Majority of developing countries can't borrow infinite money like USA/Western Europe to replace jobless worker's paychecks for even short periods of time.  Example, look at China consumer lenders saying they have 20% delinquent consumer loans already. China hasn't announced a paycheck replacement program despite being 3 months post lockdown even though Chinese/developing countries have non-existent unemployment insurance benefits, especially for the masses of migrant workers. If China goes back into lock down, China's debt bubble may finally pop or at least deflate super quick. Best case, no more fast artificial China growth propping up world economy, worst case China economy implodes and takes down developed countries' economies even faster.  SP500 has so much international exposure, especially to former fast growing developing countries (looking at China again along with tourist driven SE Asia and oil shocked OPEC+), this will kill a big part of 2019's priced in profit growth/current profits.  USA Stimulus already at $3t and is aimed at patching 8 weeks of service/travel/oil sector work stoppage. So 15% of last year's annual $21.4t GDP. And each additional month/round of stimulus is another $1.5t/8% of GDP. And this is just propping up the average income workers. There's no way Democrat controlled congress will allow high earner incomes to be backstopped via stimulus. Look at the $75k-99k income phaseout of the $1.2k checks.  TLDR -I see three outcomes:  Fast leg down: If China has a 2nd wave anytime in next several weeks and is forced to freeze their economy again, investors will panic knowing same pattern will repeat for rest of world economy and we'll sell off fast.  Slow leg down: If China successfully maintains their quasi zombie soft lock down they have now, once investors see there's no V recovery back to old normal and developed countries' lock down keep getting extended because we can't clamp down as hard as welded doors China, markets will bleed out slowly.  Full recovery: If we miraculously discover a cure or vaccine in next 2-3 months, sooner the better before permanent econ damage is done, we'll get our V recovery and markets will shoot to new infinite QE inflated ATHs.

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-  *****  #[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, April 6th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday.html)  *****  &gt; * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday‚Äôs open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. ‚ÄúWe have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,‚Äù Dimon wrote.  *****  &gt; * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were ‚Äúvery close‚Äù to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose ‚Äúvery substantial‚Äù tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he‚Äôll need to do so.  *****  &gt; * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world ‚Äî in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries ‚Äî Italy, Spain and Germany ‚Äî combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.  *****  &gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe‚Äôs hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain‚Äôs 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.  *****  &gt; * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/0rzY1MT.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bqio851.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wE4myjO.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrxih7p.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/CiSjNJD.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: *($SMPL $CONN $GBX $LEVI $ANGO $RPM $SGH $LNN $MSM $SJR $WDFC $NTIC $EXFO $CAAP $SLP $TLGT)* ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R9DSwjk.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: *()* ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) N/A.  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/czYmPJb.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**) NONE.  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4kzBNe8.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gUMjuu3.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sHtCwud.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/RHiAMQ5.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GWPlDMv.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:  * DAL * IMMU * ZM * LK * JPM * SQ * W * AAL * WORK * USO  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-slack-zoom-jetblue-delta-boeing-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Slack Technologies (WORK)** ‚Äì The provider of the popular workplace messaging platform announced a $600 million debt offering due in 2025, convertible into cash, stock, or a combination of both depending on the holder‚Äôs preference.  &gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** WORK  &gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=WORK&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)  &gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WORK)**)  *****  &gt; **Zoom Video Communications (ZM)** ‚Äì Credit Suisse downgraded the video communications platform company to ‚Äúunderperform‚Äù from ‚Äúneutral,‚Äù saying the current share price reflects greater conversion to paid usage than will actually occur.  &gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** ZM  &gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=ZM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)  &gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/ZM)**)  *****  &gt; **JetBlue (JBLU)** ‚Äì JetBlue is burning through $10 million per day as it deals with the coronavirus outbreak, according to CEO Robin Hayes.

This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.  #LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN  The initial post had one image in it, and it was apparently only after that it showed no actual information.  [Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.  The reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&amp;P and elsewhere:  [Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.  [Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)  [Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)  [Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)  [Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)  [Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)  [Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)  What originally got me taking a look at this is the gobs macking nature of the market, and the ""how could this possibly be up right now"" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)  There's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.  [When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.  [The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (May 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)  Taking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.  I do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're bull ETFs.  To explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.

Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.  We're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up.

fucked the bears, then the bulls then anyone long gamma. Growth died, value (ex-energy) died and momentum died. If your portfolio's still alive... congrats on your #thetagang tendies &amp; there's still the weekend for Trump to tweet something out to completely screw your ""portfolio"".  With one little tweet on Thursday, Trump got the markets more excited than a teenager discovering porn for the first time:  [Note the words \\""expect\\"" and \\""hope\\""](https://preview.redd.it/82fventtgsq41.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f559ac2cceabaf1822d23f0042d239548af7f432)  Damn if that didn't go and destroy üåàüêª in a single tweet. Credit spreads led by shitty e&amp;p's tightened, equities ignored the largest initial jobless claims number ever and crude oil had the largest single day return of all time. Straight up boiler room shit. If market-manipulation weren't illegal, he'd be claiming to have engineered the ""greatest pump of all time""  Except he'd be wrong. That award goes to a little company called Porsche.  **The Squeeze**  Remember 2008? Bear Stearns was bailed out, Lehman was allowed to fail and shit was hitting the fan. GM, Ford and Chrysler were begging for handouts in the middle of the worst auto market in 25 years.  Now if I were to tell you that for a brief period that year, that Volkswagen became the largest company in the world, would you believe me?  [Now those are some serious gainz](https://preview.redd.it/dicd7ff9hsq41.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3249bcd32bfdf68bd4630d69de875d97bb7442db)  For a few brief minutes on October 28th, 2008, the price of Volkswagen stock was up more than 113% in a day, hitting ‚Ç¨1,005/share (for you autists, a ‚Ç¨ is like a $, except when you put it in the bank they take some away from you instead of giving you more) and beating out ExxonMobil to be the largest company in the world (for a couple minutes). This was after the stock had already shot up 93% the day before.  So how did this epic two day squeeze happen? To explain, we have to look back at history, starting with WWII.  **The Part With Hitler**  It was the mid-1930's and Hitler was chomping at the bit to get a chance at a rematch with the US for the title belt. He was doing what he could to boost up the German economy and wanted a car that could rival Ford's. He commissioned Volkswagen to create low-cost transportation for the German people and an up-and-coming engineer by the name of Ferdinand Porsche designed the iconic Beetle.  He became famous for his work and left to start making sports cars on his own. Thus Porsche was born.  **The Part With the Cuckoldry**  Porsche had two kids, a son and a daughter, and the daughter married a dude named Pi√´ch and so the Porsche and Pi√´ch families ended up controlling the Porsche company. Happy ending, right?  *Wrong.*  The Porsche and Pi√´ch families fucking hated each other. The Porsches looked down upon Pi√´chs because they weren't real Porsches. The Pi√´chs looked down upon the Porsches because they were weak and cucks. Literally.  [Porsche family tree](https://preview.redd.it/lzc6g7t2isq41.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=034f4283e9a1cfdfa8ddbe1532e00caaee273e92)  Ferdinand Pi√´ch (remember the name... he's important later) had a public affair with his cousin's wife for twelve years and even had two children with her. Can see why the two families hated each other, right?  The families fought about everything and finally, in 1970, decided that no member of the Porsche or Pi√´ch family should work at the family company and that outside managers would run the company. Great, right? Well not for Ferdinand Pi√´ch.  You see... our boy Ferdinand was an up and rising star in the automobile world and was the leading contender to take over as CEO of Porsche. But because of this squabble, he was forced out of the company he was a shareholder of and took at job at Audi, a Volkswagen owned brand. He rose up the ranks and became CEO of Audi in 1988 and CEO of Volkswagen in 1993.  **The First One's Free**  Porsche's long relationship with Volkswagen now spanned three generations. Post-WWII, Porsche relied on Volkswagen more and more as a partner, even to the point of many of their cars essentially being Volkswagen chassis with a Porsche engine.  But there was one issue. Volkswagen was a super low margin company ($125bn in revenue vs $2.2bn net income in 2005) and so as a shitty company, its market cap was only $17bn. Super cheap and open to a hostile takeover (which would've ended this decades old relationship).  The state of Lower Saxony in Germany had held a 20.2% voting block in Volkswagen ever since it was privatized so to prevent any future hostile takeovers of Volkswagen, Porsche really only had to hold a small position. They announced that they were spending $4.2bn for a 18.5% stake in Volkswagen.  **Porsche Goes Autist**  Like each of you autist knows... there's no feeling like clicking that ""buy"" button for the first time. Porsche effectively positioned itself to block any hostile takeover of Volkswagen, but it had now tasted the sweet sweet taste of trading and now wanted more.  It started trading Volkswagen. First by buying a few more shares at a time, then by buying calls. Eventually they were doing exotic structured products trades with investment banks with the underlying being... you guessed it, Volkswagen stocks.  By 2008, Porsche had a 35% equity stake in Volkswagen. It was still selling cars, but like a true autist, it was raking in tendies from trading derivatives on Volkswagen. Of its 2Q profits in 2008, only 20% came from making cars and the rest came from ""hedging transactions"". A true autist.  **Arbitrage**  Listed companies have different ways they can practice shitty corporate governance and screw over their shareholders. One method is to have two different shares of stocks (see $SNAP, $GOOGL) where one class, the ordinary (ords) have voting rights and the preferred (prefs) have a ""guaranteed"" dividend, but no voting rights. Depending on the dividend, important shareholder votes, etc the price action of ords and the prefs may be slightly different day to day, but they're still shares of the same company so they should move in sync over the long run.  [Chart 1 - Candle: Ords, Green: Prefs \[Normalized to 100\] \/\/ Chart 2 - Red: Spread](https://preview.redd.it/b8kqw0r6isq41.png?width=1508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f784d7400ffd0f86296f9d80aa6c64e6db034c16)  In 2008, the candle (Volkswagen ords) and green (Volkswagen pref) lines started moving apart in March and accelerated throughout the year. This got the attention of the guys on Arbitrage desks at hedgies, prop houses.  When you hear ""Arbitrage"" (See also: LTCM), think ""Literally can't go tits up"" desk. They do ""risk free"" trades and this type of trade was perfect.  You see... having a 35% ownership of Volkswagen, Porsche had also announced that it wasn't buying any more shares. So there wasn't any risk of this spread going higher. By buying the prefs (the green line) and shorting the voting right ords (candle), hedgies could eat this spread ""risk-free"". Eventually that spread would come together. By early October 2008, this trade was incredibly popular and short interest on the ords was 12%  **Porsche Goes Full Autist**  On October 26th, 2008, Porsche, in a [press release](https://www.porsche-se.com/en/news/press-releases/details/news/detail/News/porsche-heads-for-domination-agreement-1), stated that instead of 35%, it now owned 42.6% of Volkswagen ordinary shares. It also announced that it owned call options (in the form of structured products) on an additional 31.5% of the company. It was now officially announcing its intention to take out Volkswagen, after saying for over a year it had no intention to.  Ferdinand Pi√´ch who was still CEO (and also a 10% owner of Porsche; board member of both companies... great corporate governance, right?) showed that he had engineered a way to not only cement himself permanently as CEO of Volkswagen, but by combining the two companies, become an even bigger presence in the auto world than his grandpappy.  If you're following along and doing the math.... Porsche with 42.6% of voting equity + 31.5% via calls = 74.1% of the company. Also the state of Lower Saxony owned 20.2% and index funds owned an approx 5%. That's 99% of all the ords. The holders of the 12% short interest were... royally fucked.  Some of the world-famous hedgies that got bent over during those two days include: Steve Cohen, David Einhorn, Paul Singler.  **The Aftermath**  The funny thing is that Porsche had really, truly gone full autist on the trade. Porsche had borrowed more than ‚Ç¨15bn to finance the stock and derivative purchases over 3 years and ‚Ç¨10bn of that was due soon (in the middle of the financial crisis... guess if they were able to refinance). To make matters worse... in true autist form, they didn't have the money on hand to take delivery of the shares they had the right to buy via their options.  Ultimately, in what is a fucked up ending to a fucked up story.... Volkswagen bailed out Porsche by buying Porsche AG (the manufacturing arm) from Porsche SE (the holding company) so that Porsche SE (the holding company) could finish buying Volkswagen. Essentially... Porsche SE now owned Volkswagen who owned Porsche AG. Hmm.  Porsche's CEO gets fired for this royal fuck-up and goes to work as a pizza boy at a pizzeria. Ferdinand Pi√´ch, as a large stakeholder in Porsche, now controls the company he's the CEO of.  And thus ends the story of the greatest short squeeze of all time.  **tl;dr:** Germans engineered the greatest short squeeze of all time, causing an automaker to become the largest company in the world during the middle of the GFC.

This is for 3/26-3/27. I‚Äôm your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.  &amp;#x200B;  DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.  &amp;#x200B;  As is tradition, I shall start with the news. [Boris Johnson](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpv7i4/boris_johnson_tests_positive_for_covid19/) (The UK's Trump) has tested positive for WuFlu. That=we are fuk. There is news [that GM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqf7b/gm_building_mass_ventilators_fake_news_people/) and Ford will not be building ventilators for the hospitals as DJ Trump said. They did not realize the logistics and that transmissions and ventilators are not the same thing. For those of us that cant extrapolates, this means fewer ventilators for victims of China's Plague of Doom.  &amp;#x200B;  The Federal Government and JPow are spending a shit load on trying to keep the SS Economy from taking a nose dive to the Marianas Trench. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/) explains the numbers and there are even pictures for you to look at. The Fed is throwing lots and lots of money at this problem to make the ship sink a little slower. Well, they can't do that forever and today is clearly an example of that. Money only makes people happy for so long, especially when their family is dying.  &amp;#x200B;  Now I know we hate every other investing subreddit, however, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fp4vxy/my_experience_of_the_2008_bailout/) is a good (serious) view of what the coming months will look like and relates what is coming to 2008. We are ticking all the boxes of similarities and that is not a good thing. Not saying its gonna be as bad as The Great Recession but lookout.    &amp;#x200B;  Next is another bit of knowledge for you fucks. My boy u/fuzzyblankeet did one of the [best breakdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) I have ever seen using SeaWorld (SEAS) as an example. He explains how to break down any companies 10-K (which is an annual report about the financials, company makeup, etc.). He shows us retards how to do a targeted review, breakdown and understand their debt, and goes over financial covenants. These are all big words but if you read the post then it'll be a lot easier to understand. Reading this post will allow you to do YOUR OWN DD instead of relying on WSB and fucking idiots like me.  &amp;#x200B;  On to the actual plays. Mariott (MAR) looks like it's gonna have some problems because of the Beer Flu. No one is traveling right now so no one is booking hotel rooms. No bookings= no revenue. Expect a drop in earnings, and because of this, a drop in stock price. MAR 5/15 50p is what [the OP said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpiimx/big_dd_marriott_is_dead/) but I would go for a higher strike because people will want to sell at the price of the stock now ($80) if it drops to $50 a share.    &amp;#x200B;  Likewise, oil is going to be something to watch in the coming weeks. If America and our economy goes tits up, oil goes tits up according to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ff7/the_fall_of_oil_and_how_you_can_make_tendies/).  The US economy grinding to a standstill will compound with the Saudis dropping the price per barrel and ramping up production. His post gives us a few ways to profit from the fall of oil including ETFs, options, and stocks. Puts on any oil company that can not support itself through this and make sure they expire late April/May. Note, DO NOT play with DWT or UWT. They are being delisted on April 3rd.   &amp;#x200B;  (Warning; satire!) Now I'm gonna do a little fear-mongering. So the book of Revelations tells humans how the world will end. The 4 horsemen of the apocalypse will come (Famine, Death, War, Pestilence), trumpets will sound, and the end will be nigh. We already have death and pestilence (which means plague) because of COVID19. Famine is coming with the [GIANT SWARM OF LOCUSTS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-a-plague-of-locusts-is-threatening-crops-in-africa-and-beyond/ar-BB11JOHX?li=BBnb7Kz) 3 times the size of New York in Africa and the middle east. And with China and the US having a [dick measuring contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsulz/trade_war_part_2/) in the Taiwan Strait we are looking at the possibility of war. Also, are we sure that God said trumpets and not Trump/Pence? Just kidding, this is all bullshit, I don't believe in God. If he's real then he's a dick.  Strike me down where I stand.  &amp;#x200B;  Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is [this man](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpm6qt/ive_been_told_to_come_here_to_make_it_all_back/). Why would you come to WSB to make your money back? What a fucking idiot. I thought that everyone knew we only lost money here. You lose $260,000 and come to the hive mind of autism for help? Fuck off.  &amp;#x200B;  Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR; Boris Johnson is fuk, GM and Ford are not medical manufacturers, Feds can only fuck the market for so long, Mariott is fucked possibly, Oil is fucked possibly, and the Book of Revelations is happening.

It appears, the auto execs never got the full logistics of the buildout and who was paying.  GM initially said that they could turn their car factory and use auto transmissions to quickly build 20,000 ventilators. Turns out that was false, and they realized that auto transmissions do not have much in common with ventilators and they maybe will be able to get 5000 out.  The administration is back at square one and talking with other manufacturers to get realistic pricing and ventilator numbers. Even if they are able to find a manufacturer in the next week, do we expect them to turn out 20,000+(still a low number) ventilators within a month or sooner? If so, what will the infection and severe cases look like by then? If not, what will deaths look like?  I wonder if Donny's optimistic tweets and outlook helps the market pump? If it does, reality should hit and we realize that Uncle Donny was only speaking in hyperbole and market should correct for that?

It appears, the auto execs never got the full logistics of the buildout and who was paying.   GM initially said that they could turn their car factory and use auto transmissions to quickly build 20,000 ventilators. Turns out that was false, and they realized that auto transmissions do not have much in common with ventilators and they maybe will be able to get 5000 out.   The administration is back at square one and talking with other manufacturers to get realistic pricing and ventilator numbers. Even if they are able to find a manufacturer in the next week, do we expect them to turn out 20,000+(still a low number) ventilators within a month? If so, what will the infection and severe cases look like by then?   I wonder if Donny's optimistic tweets and outlook helps the market pump? If it does, reality should hit and we realize that Uncle Donny was only speaking in hyperbole and market should correct for that?

Period. Sure people picked up cash on puts during this crash, but that was universal. Will there be volatility? 100%.   Tesla has a TON of cash. Between their credit lines (which was extended in FEB with borderline clairvoyance) and cash reserves we are talking about 8.5B.   Tesla‚Äôs competition has been crushed. Ford / GM/ Fiat, they all have higher operations expenses (I.E. dealerships / union workers pensions, high employee counts, etc.).   Believe it or not, Tesla has the best ability to fair in this storm. When the storm settles their competition will be hurting far worse.   They are using this time to EXPAND. Other manufactures are overproducing vehicles, Tesla needs to increase output to meet demand. That‚Äôs a good spot.   Tesla also has a great footprint and relationship with the very hard market of China (which will buy MAD vehicles and they won‚Äôt be Ford). I mean PR or not Elon essentially mocked the CV by purchasing ventilators from the source of the virus as overstock and delivered them to the US. Those 1.25k ventilators are now 25% of the ventilators delivered to NYC.   Not to mention, future ventures in solar, insurance (leveraging driver data), vehicle autonomy software, ride share. Space??  Buy Tesla. It ignores the rules of the market and has the potential to still hit 1k a share before EOY and could be worth 4K a share before 2024.   Tesla is a true WSB even simply buying shares. If you think you can time it with calls, god bless.

Apologies, but I'm too lazy to site shit.  **I. The Death of Risk Parity Signals Inflation**   So the risk-party is trade has disappeared now that stocks and bonds are moving together. But wait, what the fuck does it even mean for the negative correlation to flip? I hypothesize this signals inflation.  Why? Well, let me teach you some history. The relationship between stocks and bonds has not always been this way. Here's the chart of bond yields vs stock going back to when the boomers were fucked into existence:  https://preview.redd.it/irpl351nv9o41.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=968aba76ed6cf362d58d76a13235f0a93efb5716  Notice, the current relationship between stocks and bonds harkens back to the 1980s right after a huge inflationary moment. Pre 1980s, policy was focused on reining in inflation. Since then, particularly since the market crashes of the 2000s, the mindset shifted from an inflationary one to a deflationary one.  https://preview.redd.it/erucs24rw9o41.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2427382fba830c32ce7076d22e392dcc8109b0c9  In a deflationary mindset, when stock prices go down, an asset manager worries about deflation, so he'll run to bonds. When stock prices go up, deflation is no longer feared, so the manager gets out of bonds. This is what we've been experiencing since the 80s.  Transitioning to an inflationary environment, however, both asset classes track one another more closely. This will not happen overnight, likely over a few years, but we may be seeing the beginnings of a transition at this moment.  **II. The Post Virus Era**  I do not think we will have a v-shaped recovery. The post-virus world will differ wildly from what we knew. I imagine the differences may be somewhat akin to what we experienced post 9/11. Trump and his staff calling COVID the ""Chinese virus"" is a glimpse of the future. Going forward, expect  * Trade restrictions * Travel restrictions * De-globalization * De-risking across industries * Increased costs throughout supply chains * Lower P/E multiples * Inflation  Business will not be conducted as usual.  While, yes, industries are on the brink of collapse, it's still somewhat bizarre that we still have such little buying. Given all the QE and promise of stimulus, surely some of the current prices make sense even if you account for three more months of lost revenue. Many companies are trading below their book values. Insiders are buying. What gives? I believe the market is aware that the future will look quite different.  **III.  Why QE is doing Jack Shit**  I believe one of the reason's price has not stabilized at all despite the assurances of free money is that the market does not believe the old prices will be realized: fair value will be far lower. This is not just in equity valuations though. This discrepancy has appeared in all of the corporate bond ETFs where the ETFs are trading at a 5% discount, and market makers don't seem interested in making markets at the current levels: they're still afraid they'll lose. Even though the fed has put up a trillion dollars (theoretically they could put up an infinite amount),  no one wants in--even with free money!--because the market hasn't believed we're at the bottom. The would never happen if we were anywhere near fair value. This is also why I believe we are currently so oversold and yet still have a bit more room to sell.  **IV.  Hunting for Fair Value**  Insider buying is worthwhile watching right now. There are some companies trading at absurdly low price to book valuations, and the executive know it. I'd recommend avoiding puts on any names with a lot of insider buying. You will get fucked out of the water, especially as these guys tell friends and family to buy. I got my ass handed to me on an SPG play because those fuckers started buying stock by the fist-full even through there P/E was still fairly high. Similarly, avoid puts on stocks that are trading below book value unless you're damn certain they're headed for bankruptcy.  I would not buy puts next week unless you're completely autistic.  \---  Positions:  4/17p F, GM, GE, USO, INDA, EWW, EWZ, EEM, LUV, M  Yes, some of these are illiquid.

Quick background: 1. I studied Emergency management 2. Extensive FEMA training in disaster response 3. I‚Äôve had a hand in managing over 15 natural and man maid disasters (think hurricanes, tornados, Ebola outbreak)  FEMA FOR DUMMIES:  	Anyone who has been watching the news has seen that Trump has been talking with FEMA on how to help stop the spread of Corona Virus. Most of FEMA‚Äôs fame comes from their natural disaster response (or lack thereof). One of FEMA‚Äôs greatest abilities is planning, and when I say they plan for everything I mean EVERYTHING. The key to disaster response is to have a plan BEFORE disaster happens. These emergency response plans are written down, reviewed, and tested over and over. Emergency managers do this because they know that when shit hits the fan people panic and if there is already a plan for when shit starts going sideways then its easier to calm down and overcome the problem. Besides FEMA and the FAA the Federal government is very inefficient and about as fast as old people fuckin. After 9/11 FEMA really kicked their ass into high gear and designed a management system that can be scaled to any size and type event, I personally know a local emergency manager who used this system to plan and coordinate his daughters wedding, the same system that helps local, state, and federal governments respond to disaster such as super storm Sandy and hurricane Katrina, its that‚Äôs flexible and efficient. These systems are called the [Incident Command System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System) and [National Incident Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Incident_Management_System) and are used to respond to any disaster anywhere at anytime. Fun fact: some of you might already know this but [the IRS even has a plan for collecting taxes after a nuclear war.](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/yes-the-irs-has-an-emergency-apocalypse-plan-to-collect-taxes/)  	Now everyone thinks that trump is in charge and he‚Äôs the one running this show, and on paper he is. However William Brockmann Long is really the HMFIC running this show. Billy is the one who is fundamentally in charge of making sure the United States has a plan to respond to any type of disaster. Trump might be the one saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing X about Y‚Äù but really its FEMA who is calling the shots and advising the president, Trump is just pulling the trigger. So no matter how much of a babbling ape headed buffoon you think trump is its doesn‚Äôt matter because there is a whole team of level headed people behind him who‚Äôs one and only job is to manage emergencies.  HOW THIS RELATES TO THE ECONOMY:  		Remember when I said FEMA is efficient as Fuck? Well most companies on the SPX are big enough to understand that large scale disasters have the ability to extremely fuck up their business. That‚Äôs why most large corporations have emergency disaster plans, much like FEMA‚Äôs, written down in advance incase anything happens. Walmart has an entire [Emergency Operations Center](https://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/upload/Walmart-Resliency_052316_v2.pdf) that runs 25/8 and its main job is to be on the look out and respond to emergencies that directly impact their company. Most major companies have departments like this model after NIMS and ICS. Here are some examples: [Disney emergency manager job posting](https://jobs.livecareer.com/l/crisis-management-planning-program-manager-disney-cac507473de325204963b6fc39139e51), [PPT presentation on Boeing‚Äôs emergency management system](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2009/DIBCIP/Komendat.pdf), and [Amazon job posting for Emergency Management Director ](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/pm-emergency-response-and-business-continuity-at-amazon-1509562192)  	So while investors might not have ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù the effects of this global disaster I can guarantee you almost every company on the SPX did, and they have a plan to overcome it. We already are seeing news articles about car companies repurposing their factories to make ventilators and cruise companies offering their ships to help house patients. While the general public might not have had a plan for a fast sweeping indiscriminate plague sized case of beer aids, I am willing to bet my entire life savings (&lt;$50,000) on the fact that every major company out there has a binder on a shelf somewhere with a section in it detailing how the company should respond to a pandemic in order to mitigate any negative effects.  	So while the investors might not have priced in the beer aids and stock fell like a fat bitch during an earthquake, most companies are well ahead of the curve. Majority of you will hate to hear this, but were close to the bottom. Give it one month and everything will be very close to being back to normal. Sure GDP might fall and a few smaller companies that weren‚Äôt prepared for a disaster will go under but in one months time there will be no reason for stock prices to continue to be falling.  TL;DR: FEMA, DIS, WMT, et al. have priced in beer aids. Stonks only go up until they don‚Äôt, and the IRS will still taxes those gains after a nuke.

This isn't like the housing crash - it effects EVERYONE.    How far does 1K get you? You still going to be shipping all sorts of crap to your house from Amazon or are you going to try and save every penny you have so you can keep the lights/gas/heat/AC/on and food on the table another month?   Here is a middle of the road projections based on this: [Article from WaPo on potential projections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-forecasts-are-grim-its-going-to-get-worse/2020/03/11/2a177e0a-63b4-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html)  Best case was 320 deaths - worst case was 1.635 MILLION... let's split it down the middle  331,000,000 people in the US - let's say 25% get sick - 82,000,000 - let's say only 1% mortality (its 1-3 now but not overly reliable) - that's 820,000 dead Americans   THAT IS DOUBLE THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DEATHS FOR THE US IN WWII  Now - let's say we solve this half way through - that's 400,000 deaths - about equal to WWII - and that's if we handle things right.   I'm pretty OK with my puts right now - don't see much room for a booming market anytime soon.

Now, I'm no economist, nor do I want to be one, but I think these claims are egregious. We're only two weeks into this mess, it took China almost two months to get back to work. The market is constantly testing new lows and portfolio managers on CNBC keep discussing the new risks that come with social-distancing procedures. Firms are more levered than ever, the Saudi's and Russian's are in an oil war which is inadvertently crushing U.S. oil companies that took huge loans after the Great Recession. Airlines, hospitality, cruises, restaurants, retailers, dentists, etc are being put on furlough. The hospitality industry itself is asking for $150bn to help get over this situation. Keep in mind the VERY controversial GM bailout was $11.2bn. Speaking of the auto industry, they will completely shut down starting tomorrow. Many states are also starting to make declarations allowing home owners and renters delayed payments.  As far as positions go, $200 SPY puts a month or more out. For those of you making tendies and feeling charitable, I ask to first consider donating to neighbors or friends with children. Times of uncertainty like this can be scary when they don't completely understand what's happening.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-may-have-priced-in-coronavirus-recession-morning-brief-101849179.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-may-have-priced-in-coronavirus-recession-morning-brief-101849179.html)|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|1025221|public|confidence|self|||Coronavirus Priced In?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkukk4/coronavirus_priced_in/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '3UJvu3KsMhWhY2iBf95wn8FgA4rv2ixIsrKd_s6LW9s', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a0903f505a69538af07eed680b31e01c5bae1d', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24152c70403b605f2573838813de087ae8c1f467', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4839192c106f7c94f6d48a2a4ce4bb4ec0eb27', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a198b6c9ef2e9c80d6806cde841dad7629c6de05', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb630af1bd02a3f645bf30d1c0031cdb3be73cc', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1da9e7ff7f8958ef0553f5f1816c98d0833d8d6', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 3600, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NIY_dqFz9T73uKt2Ys4Vjac02q56V5hhb3vzgvB6oow.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d7250efe3303d92f2c3171c8f52856ba45f5f90a', 'width': 5400}, 'variants': {}}]}|||1584556876.0|||||||||2020-03-18|GM

A family friend is C-Suite at one of the top 3 American Auto OEMs supplying Ford, GM, etc.      He's banging my Mom and let slip that there was a big meeting today where the industry heads arrived at the decision to freeze OEM production for at least 6 weeks, announcement TBD but very soon. So how do I turn these ghost transmissions into tendies? (He usually let's my Dad pay rent on the room above the garage a bit late, but demanded it on time this week so I know he is worried.)     Here is my attempt at DD, let me know if I should change to DD flair:  &amp;#x200B;  \- Domestic OEMs that sell to car companies: lay-offs, slashed expectations, bad press due to lay-offs and slashed expectations, panic when customers realize they might have to buy a steering wheel off of a Benihana menu, etc. So, short the OEMs? But we already know auto industry is fucked, so this type of news is probably priced in but might cause a dramatic dip in the near-term, yeah?      \- Car companies: pretty much same as above, except the 1 month chart for all these companies kinda look like when you throw a baseball and no one catches it so it just hits the ground. Is it possible for these stocks to go negative? Should I wait until the share price is negative so they have to pay me to assume the risk of the stock?  &amp;#x200B;  \- NWL: Newell Brands, the owner of Elmer's Glue. When Henry Ford said faster horses or w/e we weren't in a recession. Well guess what we are in a recession. We will probably have more horses on the streets because we have less cars (there is a historical precedent that these goods are direct replacements if you compare DoD data). More horses on the streets = more dead horses = more glue supply. Shitty foreign car parts = need glue to keep the cars stuck together = more revenue. Maybe throw 3M in there cause I think they make car glue, idk if you need a different type of horse for that though? I know it's a different horse from wood glue.      Thoughts?

Sales in China for Ford and GM are already being lost to domestic Chinese companies. Check this article from Jan:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html)      **Reason #2: Coronavirus in China and the US**   Coronavirus has TANKED auto sales in China (over 80%). People aren't going out, people aren't buying cars. Unless you're getting a car from a Carvana machine, you're probably at a dealership shaking hands, which no one wants to do right now. China sales drop, which we can expect to see mirrored in the US as the virus spreads.     [https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/)      Manufacturing facilities are also slowed in China, and likely to be slowed in the US. This is not a job that can be done working from home, and the manufacturing process will suffer if people cannot go out to work in factories.     **Reason #3: Looming Recession**   With the possibility off a recession on the horizon, this is especially important to consider. Auto Manufacturing gets absolutely pummeled in recessions. Cars are simply not a luxury people can afford in troubling financial times.

Obviously you'd tell to me fuck off, yet here I am long time lurker first time caller with a low risk/high reward talk for you.   **The Plan**  GM CEO The Virgin Mary Barra spoke on EV wednesday and announced their plans to beat Tesla at their own game.  The battery modules: Ultium, is going to lower the price of EVs while still pumping in profit for the company. The battery also has a longer range than Tesla models boasting a 400 mile range. The Cars: 11 Future EVs have been released, they already have the Chevy Bolt. Announced was a Fully Self-Driving Cruise Origin, The Luxury SUV Cadillac Lyriq, and the fucking Electric hummer. A fucking hummer being unveiled on May 20th with production in Sept 2021. As of right now Tesla sold 90% of the US's electric cars. GM is the only company with a tangible and easily obtainable that can take on take like no other company can  **The Tendies**  C'mon, guy, wheres the money?   This is not a short term plan. I'm not talking a next call strike up expiring 3/13. I talking Jan 2021/2022 calls. GM just hit a new 52 week low on Friday and could possible go lower this week too, the calls are fucking cheap. If your like me and lost 90% of your money between Mon-Tues in The Fuckening, this could be a long term pre-heat the oven and retrieve tendies when cooked.   **Disclosure** Am I saying that GM is going to have insane runs like Papa Musk gave us in the last couple months, no. Do I think that GM has the potential to triple or quadruple in value, absolutely. Before you say it's just a car company, there's no way. So is Tesla, I think 60% of the reason Tesla is so successful is because of Musk. GM doesn't have a musk, they a 20 Billion plan to pump out EVs in the next coming years.

FCAU 01/15/21 $10P**  &amp;#x200B;  With the economy seeming entering in to the next recession (or worse), we are all wondering where we can get our money in to become the guy from the Big Short.  &amp;#x200B;  As noted in the TL;DR at the top for all the autists who can only read TSE, I believe the auto industry will be the next one to crash.  &amp;#x200B;  Here is why:  US households are absolutely jacked with car loans. As stated in this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-auto-loan-debt/), "" Auto loans now make up nearly 10% of all household debt, the third largest debt category behind mortgages and student loans. "" While this may not be that surprising, the point is these things are an extremely heavy burden for individuals. Additionally, cars are a significantly more liquid asset to sell than a home... more on this later.  &amp;#x200B;  Similar to what was observed in the run-up to the housing market crash, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of sub-prime loans for automobiles. You can read about this [here](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/auto-loan-subprime-crisis/).  &amp;#x200B;  Essentially, what we are seeing in the auto industry is the same thing as the housing market: people are taking out way too large of loans they cannot afford.  &amp;#x200B;  **How does this relate to the current state of the economy?**  &amp;#x200B;  All of this being said, we know what happens when an economy is hurled into a recession. Companies layoff employees, debts stop being repaid, and people / businesses begin defaulting on their loans.  &amp;#x200B;  Since people are extremely leveraged on their car loans, any hiccup to their income may cause difficulty in repaying the loan. This will cause millions of car owners to either sell their car or it will get repossessed. Here is the intro to econ level analysis of how this scenario plays out:  &amp;#x200B;  People lose jobs  ...................**This causes demand of used cars to increase**  Can't afford car loan  Sell / get car repossessed  ...................**This causes supply of used cars to increase**  The increased supply and increased demand of used cars causes total quantity demanded to increase (rather dramatically, depending on your opinion of the future of the economy).  &amp;#x200B;  There are only so many cars being sold around the country / world. With the quantity demanded of used cars increasing, the demand for new cars will decrease. As a result, firms such as GM and FCAU may struggle to stay in business, let alone make a profit.  &amp;#x200B;  Short GM and FCAU...

I use to speak to the likes of you when I worked at a discount brokerage firm at the trade desk in my 20s. I worked through two epic time frames, the great recession and the flash crash. There was never a better time to trade, and I see this happening again. Bulls and Bears both got slaughtered as the volatility to both sides was a sight to see with 10% moves in the indexes on a daily basis. Long/Short was the profitable style, and everyone said, ""this is the way"".  This is where Wall Street removes money from inbred Main Street. These are flea infested plebs who would buy GMGMQ (bankrupt General Motors) after they were told they were going to lose everything. They would do it again now if they could before making a 10x on TSLA calls because they were truly retarded.  WSB is the greatest self help group for degenerate addicts like me, but instead of trying to limit our addictions, we encourage them to riches or to ruin (aka the $ROPE). Remember, AA is for quitters.  I had my first child (or at least the first woman to file a paternity suit against me for child support) that looks remarkably like the Amazon Driver (for you boomers, this is the equivalent to the milkman fathering the child that you raised as your own) but the DNA test came back and it is mine. This group helps me get through the long night when I have her every other weekend.  I am going to leave you all with a few thoughts to wrap this up with:  1. Don't be a üåàüêª 2. Never eat ü¶áü•£ 3. When you meet an Asian hooker, make sure to wear a üò∑ 4. Always Long $ROPE, never Short, as you want to snap the neck, not suffer from strangulation 5. If you opt for $JUMP, 10th floor minimum, as anything below will leave you paralyzed  Thank you ALL again for brining joy to my black heart. May your tendies be strong and bountiful for you all, unless you are a üåàüêª."|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|891233|public|confidence|self|||Autistic Degenerate Senior/Elder Millenial|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f77vtd/autistic_degenerate_seniorelder_millenial/|no_ads|0||||||||||||||2020-02-21|GM

Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg all have a good chance to leave today‚Äôs first-in-the-nation Iowa presidential caucuses with the most delegates.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.  # **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)** ***** &gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead. ***** &gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck. ***** &gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden. ***** &gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday. ***** &gt; China‚Äôs mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs. ***** &gt; # Correction or pull back? &gt; Stocks are limping into February after January‚Äôs disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it‚Äôs been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months. ***** &gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. ‚ÄúI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,‚Äù said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a good possibility, just based on valuation‚Äîover 19.6 times forward earnings. That‚Äôs the most since 2002,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.‚Äù A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,‚Äù said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. ‚ÄúWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.‚Äù Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks. ***** &gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday‚Äôs Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI still think it‚Äôs so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don‚Äôt thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn‚Äôt really change my view,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,‚Äù she said. ***** &gt; Stovall said it‚Äôs still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders‚Äô policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,‚Äù he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls. ***** &gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing‚Äôs production shut down. ***** &gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter. ***** &gt; Stovall said he‚Äôs watching ‚Äúa combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price. ***** &gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become ‚Äúinverted.‚Äù An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China‚Äôs economy and the world economy. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**  *****  # What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!  &gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**  &gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**  *****  # Short Circuit  &gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**  &gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**  *****  # 49ers Or Chiefs?  &gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but ‚Äúdata don‚Äôt lie‚Äù: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.  &gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC‚Äîand ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.  &gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we‚Äôve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; ‚ÄúThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAnd wouldn‚Äôt you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.‚Äù  &gt; Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we‚Äôre glad the Patriots aren‚Äôt in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.  *****  # Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm  &gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October‚Äîspanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index‚Äôs streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We know from history these calm periods haven‚Äôt lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn‚Äôt obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002‚Äì2003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.‚Äù  &gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.  &gt; We certainly don‚Äôt want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003‚Äîseveral months into the 2003‚Äì2007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.  &gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.  *****  # February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months  &gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from ‚ÄúJanuary Effect‚Äù carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979‚Äîjust the sixth best month for that benchmark.  &gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February‚Äôs performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**  *****  # Market May be Immune to Coronavirus  &gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.  &gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.  &gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.  &gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.  &gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.  &gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.  &gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; * **$DIS**  &gt; * **$GOOGL**  &gt; * **$SNAP**  &gt; * **$TWTR**  &gt; * **$ABBV**  &gt; * **$F**  &gt; * **$QCOM**  &gt; * **$UBER**  &gt; * **$SYY**  &gt; * **$SPOT**  &gt; * **$ON**  &gt; * **$PINS**  &gt; * **$TWLO**  &gt; * **$BMY**  &gt; * **$CMG**  &gt; * **$IRBT**  &gt; * **$CHKP**  &gt; * **$MRK**  &gt; * **$CNC**  &gt; * **$SNE**  &gt; * **$SIRI**  &gt; * **$GM**  &gt; * **$GILD**  &gt; * **$PTON**  &gt; * **$BP**  &gt; * **$ABG**  &gt; * **$LITE**  &gt; * **$WYNN**  &gt; * **$ATVI**  &gt; * **$CTLT**  &gt; * **$NSSC**  &gt; * **$ACM**  &gt; * **$GOOS**  &gt; * **$SAIA**  &gt; * **$DSPG**  &gt; * **$RACE**  &gt; * **$RCL**  &gt; * **$COP**  &gt; * **$AMG**  &gt; * **$RL** &gt; * **$PLUS**  &gt; * **$NXPI**  &gt; * **$MCK**  &gt; * **$CI**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGOGN8I.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/ITFECsE.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 2.3.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HiGR4EF.png))   &gt; # ***Monday 2.3.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pSEERXv.png))   *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 2.4.20 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zqLdRqt.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 2.4.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NLPsraN.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Dh1LRRU.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 2.5.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW6dHyJ.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 2.5.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X2cKKMR.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0rp0Yyh.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 2.6.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/02XMggZ.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aqYNFFo.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 2.6.20 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/s4LwHiF.png)) &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/evpxdCi.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 2.7.20 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DqfZS2l.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 2.7.20 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tm9eiYq.png))  *****  # Walt Disney Co $138.31 &gt; **Walt Disney Co (DIS)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, February 4, 2020.

Travel focussed stocks, such as **United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwestern Airlines (LUV)** are trading in the red, with some holding losses of over 4% on travel disruption concerns, as is **Trip.com (TCOM)**. Casino names like **Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco (MLCO)** are facing even further pressure as the confirmed cases in Macau increased to five. Copper miner **Freeport McMoran (FCX)** is lower as copper prices fall to 8-week lows on global growth concerns, while **gold miners (GOLD, NEM)** are benefitting as the precious metal rises in a safe haven bid. China listed ADR‚Äôs **(BABA, JD, BIDU)** also hit as the death toll increases.   This week‚Äôs Barron‚Äôs articles highlight that the Super Bowl will be a huge opportunity for sports betting names, as it focuses on expansion in mobile sports betting, highlighting that the street has been enthusiastic in the rising stock price in **Diamond Eagle Acquisition (DEAC).** Further on the Super Bowl, Barron‚Äôs says that advertisers like **Omnicom (OMC) and Interpublic Group (IPG)** hold less appeal, amid a further inflow of larger tech names partaking in the advertising space. Elsewhere the journalists highlight that largest tech companies such as **Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)** are competing for a larger share in esports. Finally, Barron‚Äôs notes investors in **HP (HPQ)** are likely to benefit as it has made it clear it would prefer to lever up and buy back large amounts of shares, instead of submitting an offer to **Xerox (XRX).**   #DOW   **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**  Ahead of its earnings on Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral is looking for continued improvements in iPhone revenue trends due to a strong start for the iPhone 11. However, he believes the focus is shifting to the upcoming 5G iPhone in H2 20, which should help it drive revenue growth. Elsewhere, RBC Capital analyst Muller maintains an outperform rating on the tech giant with a USD 330 PT (last closing price 318.31). The analyst states his data checks suggest its estimates for Q1 are reasonable, whilst highlighting a slight beat on consensus figures could be seen due to strength in iPhone and wearable sales.  **Boeing Company (BA)** A Boeing jet reportedly crashed in Ghazni, Afghanistan, which was operated by Ariana Afghan. The number of casualties is currently unclear, however, separate reports state the airline denied the crash. Elsewhere, Boeing successfully staged its first flight of its 777X jet.  **Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)** raised its Guyana offshore estimate to above 8ln BoE as it continues to develop the Guyana oil block.  **Intel Corp. (INTC)** has been downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at Northland, with a USD 70 PT (last closing price: 68.47). Analyst Gus Richard notes that while he forecasts several both positive and negative catalysts, he is unclear what will come first. The analyst expects Intel to fix or jettison underperforming product lines, although sees headwinds which could impact the stock, perhaps as soon as Q2 2020. Gus Richard highlights structural issues, including its design flow and manufacturing.  #NASDAQ 100   **Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)** US State Attorney Generals are to meet with the DoJ to collaborate information on a probe which relates to the co.‚Äôs monopolistic behaviour for online advertising which could harm consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.  **Kraft Heinz Co (KHC)** CEO is pushing for growth, noting its aim is for fewer and bolder bets to increase its sales, according to WSJ.  **Starbucks Corp.

(ABBV)** announced that China is testing an HIV drug as a treatment for the coronavirus. Elsewhere, **AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) / Allergan, Plc (AGN)** agreed to divest its Brazikumab and Zenpep drugs, where **Nestle (NESN SW)** will take ownership of Zenpep, and **AstraZeneca (AZN)** will acquire Brazikumab.

What will happen to the stock price if they beat on earnings next week?  Or I should say what do people expect will happen?  Can the stock price go up, considering it is not really at realistic levels to begin with? In my mind it doesnt seem like these two things (earnings and stock price) should be correlated next week as they are not now.

The Nasdaq also closed at a new high, and indications this morning point to the Dow joining the record run on an easing of fears about a possible escalation of U.S.-Iran hostilities. The projected gains for the Dow would be enough for it to set a new intraday high at the open. It needs a little less than 128 points. (CNBC) * On today‚Äôs economic calendar, the Labor Department is out with its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard all have public appearances today. (CNBC) * Lighting company Acuity Brands (AYI) is among the few companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while home builder KB Home (KBH) and lubricant producer WD-40 (WDFC) issue numbers after the closing bell. * For the first time, Tesla‚Äôs (TSLA) stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). The electric car maker‚Äôs stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of GM‚Äôs and Ford‚Äôs respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion. (Reuters) * The House will vote today on a resolution to curb President Donald Trump‚Äôs power to take military action against Iran. Nancy Pelosi said some members of Congress have ‚Äúserious, urgent concerns‚Äù about Trump‚Äôs strategy, which the administration did not assuage with a briefing or its ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù notification of the strike to Congress under the War Powers Act. (CNBC) * Trump pulls back from more military action in Iran crisis, promises new sanctions (Reuters) * GOP Sen. Mike Lee: Iran briefing from Trump administration was ‚Äòinsulting and demeaning‚Äô (USA Today) * Two rockets reportedly hit the Green Zone in Iraq‚Äôs capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missiles at bases housing U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq. The rockets were fired several hours after Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from military conflict with the U.S. (CNBC) * A Ukrainian International Airlines plane that crashed shortly after leaving Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, was reportedly on fire before impact, according to Iran‚Äôs civil aviation authority. The plane‚Äôs trajectory indicated it strayed from its route and was on its way back to a nearby airport at the time of the crash. (CNBC) * Here are the unanswered questions about the deadly plane crash in Iran (CNBC) * China‚Äôs Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country‚Äôs negotiation team in China-U.S. trade talks, will sign a ‚ÄúPhase One‚Äù deal in Washington next week. No version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key points such as increasing imports of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years. (Reuters) * A federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to use billions of dollars in military construction money to build a long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. (WSJ) * Following a secretive escape last week from Japan to Lebanon, former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn publicly defended himself Wednesday against accusations of financial misconduct and misuse of corporate resources. Ghosn adamantly denied all charges against him and defended his decision to become an international fugitive by fleeing Japan as a necessity to receive a fair trial and ‚Äúescape injustice.‚Äù (CNBC) * Lebanese investigators finish questioning Ghosn, file referred to prosecutor: judicial source (Reuters) * Ghosn regrets not accepting US offer to lead GM for double his salary (CNBC) * Fugitive former Nissan exec feared he would ‚Äòdie in Japan‚Äô if he didn‚Äôt escape (CNBC) * China‚Äôs popular video sharing app TikTok had ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù security vulnerabilities, said cybersecurity firm Check Point. It found flaws that could allow hackers to take control of TikTok accounts and manipulate the content, upload and delete videos and reveal personal information such as a private email address. (CNBC) * Twitter (TWTR) said it will test new features early this year that would allow users to control who can reply to their tweets, as it looks to limit abuse and harassment on the platform. Social media firms are under pressure to address harassment on their services. (Reuters) * Facebook‚Äôs final word on political ads: No changes to microtargeting but more control for users (NBC News) * Verizon Communications (VZ) is eliminating traditional cable bundles and the handcuffs that often came with them, making it easier for households to switch video packages in the hopes they won‚Äôt cut the cord entirely. (WSJ) * Accolade, a start-up that helps workers navigate their health benefits and dealings with insurance companies, has hired banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to advise ahead of a possible initial public offering, CNBC reported. The company is expected to file later this year. * Australian authorities urged another mass evacuation across the heavily populated southeast today as a return of hot weather fanned huge bushfires threatening several towns and communities. Thousands have been made homeless and thousands have had to evacuate repeatedly because of the volatility of the fires.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019.  # **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they‚Äôre heading straight into the month that is often the best of all. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend. ***** &gt; Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market. ***** &gt; In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.  &gt; President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump‚Äôs signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks. ***** &gt; The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government‚Äôs all-important monthly jobs data on Friday. ***** &gt; # Best month of year &gt; 2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúDecember is the best month of the year. The S&amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,‚Äù Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.‚Äù ***** &gt; Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said. ***** &gt; The market‚Äôs performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year‚Äôs Eve, Bespoke noted. ***** &gt; # S&amp;P Sub-industry sector performance &gt; Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers. ***** &gt; While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúYou want to buy now what nobody wants to own,‚Äù said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December. ***** &gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November. ***** &gt; Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665. ***** &gt; Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month. ***** &gt; # Trade tensions &gt; The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts. ***** &gt; The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch. ***** &gt; Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending. ***** &gt; Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúFor the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,‚Äù said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. ‚ÄúWe estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they‚Äôre to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.‚Äù ***** &gt; In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming. ***** &gt; The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October‚Äôs 48.3. ‚ÄúWe still think it‚Äôs going to be a sub-50 print,‚Äù said Sriram. ***** &gt; October‚Äôs durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction. ***** &gt; Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre comfortable saying we bottomed,‚Äù she said. ***** &gt; OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/krn4X8s.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0N3eZNQ.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wfpCVKo.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/6hH0LB5.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eJrTsNy.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6GHXuN4.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KNR2UeA.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PPZszVh.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/quoq9I8.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hx18PQx.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dyb9PiQ.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/29/19  &gt; Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week's data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed's index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed's gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco1.png))**  &gt; We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week's main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco3.png))**  *****  # Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For  &gt; Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png))**  &gt; Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple's (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;P 500's 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).  &gt; Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;P's gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;P's move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they're certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-1.png))**  *****  # S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png))**  &gt; So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it's only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What's interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can't hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA.png))**  *****  # Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years  &gt; As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors' valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years' range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years' readings.  &gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**  &gt; As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities' P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.  &gt; For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade's range was back in early 2018.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**  *****  # Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade  &gt; Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it‚Äôs not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.  &gt; Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).  &gt; So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it‚Äôs been down 3 of the last 5 years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7530bdceacb9ab4ad89d60e1bfa600c6/e574aa1a79d9670c-8e/s1280x1920/68c23f59d4bb7d3db3f2442c93e28fd6b34c1b43.jpg))**  *****  # Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer  &gt; This Thanksgiving, we‚Äôre thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.  &gt; Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board‚Äôs Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; We‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer‚Äôs resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.  &gt; ‚ÄúConsumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWe expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we‚Äôd like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.‚Äù  &gt; Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers‚Äô prospects.  &gt; Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest.

Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year rose to end the week at 1.94%, its highest closing level since Aug. 1, the day Trump threatened another round of tariffs on China. ***** &gt; Trump speaks to the Economic Club of New York during a Tuesday luncheon, and investors are hoping for clarity on a possible trade deal. The Fed chairman speaks Wednesday to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, and he also appears before the House Budget Committee Thursday. ***** &gt; There are a few key economic reports, including CPI on Wednesday and retail sales and industrial production on Friday. Empire State manufacturing survey Friday could provide a fresh look at the manufacturing sector in the New York region. Just a few major earnings are expected in the week ahead, including Cisco Wednesday and Walmart and NVIDIA on Thursday. ***** &gt; But trade is likely to remain the more important wild card for markets, as the calendar edges closer to Dec. 15, the date new tariffs on consumer goods from China would go into effect if there is no deal. The House of Representatives also hold impeachment hearings before the public for the first time in the coming week, but the markets have so far ignored the topic and see it unlikely that the Senate would convict the president. ***** &gt; # Stock records &gt; Stocks continued to rally to new highs this past week, and the major indices all ended the week at record levels, as bonds sold off hard. Stock market gains were limited part of the session Friday after Trump said that he has not agreed to the tariff rollbacks sought by China. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fifth week, up 0.9%, and is now up about 1.8% for November so far. The S&amp;P closed at 3,093 Friday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúPresident Trump is always unpredictable, so we‚Äôll have to see what he says,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ***** &gt; Keon expects a trade agreement of some sort in the near future, and that should help risk markets to advance. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe way we‚Äôve been interpreting this is it probably amounts to a truce. The United States has been using this rhetoric that it‚Äôs a phase one deal. China has not embraced the same rhetoric. So I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll get major progress on the thornier issues in the first deal,‚Äù Keon said. ‚ÄúThe other question is how hard does the president push in an election year to make further progress in the negotiations, given that China might dig in its heels? That‚Äôs unknowable. I have no insight into what the president is going to do.‚Äù ***** &gt; Cowen policy strategist Chris Krueger said Trump‚Äôs address Tuesday could be important for the direction of a deal. ‚ÄúIn our minds, the most critical sections will deal with trade and whether Trump is favoring the ‚Äúphase one‚Äù deal with China and a scheduled rollback of the tariffs. This could well be a trial balloon to gauge the ferocity of expected pushback from influential China hawks. Trump will give remarks and then take questions from two moderators,‚Äù wrote Krueger. ***** &gt; Powell‚Äôs testimony is not expected to have as much potential to rock markets, after the clear message he sent to markets following the Fed‚Äôs rate cut Oct. 30. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI would expect the chairman to continue the rhetoric he had at his last press conference. They‚Äôre probably on hold. It will depend on the data. If anything the data looks a little more promising on the margin. Certainly the consumer and service sector appear to be doing fine and with the GM strike ending, some of the things impacted by that should improve,‚Äù said Keon. ‚ÄúThey think rates are appropriate for now, and if the economy weakens, they‚Äôll be prepared to take further action.‚Äù ***** &gt; The health of the global economy has been a topic of concern in markets for months, but with the global rise in yields and signs of improvement in global PMI data, investors have clearly become more optimistic. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been kind of skeptical most of the year, but I do think at the margin, the economic outlook has improved, especially outside the United States,‚Äù said Keon. ‚ÄúThe recession talk that was pretty active just a month or two ago has really died down. The yield curve is dramatically uninverted. I feel a little better about the economic outlook.‚Äù ***** &gt; When the yield curve becomes inverted, short term rates, like the 2-year note yield for instance, rise above the long end, or the 10-year yield. That is very often a recession warning, as investors bet that the economy will be weaker in the longer term than it is in the near term. But there‚Äôs been a sudden shift, and now those curves are getting steeper. ***** &gt; Keon said the higher yields are a positive sign, and he is adding to stock holdings, but more in foreign names. ‚ÄúThe sense Europe was heading into a recession has died off, and there are signs things are stabilizing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis could all change in a minute but it looks like the overall outlook has significantly picked up in the last month or two.‚Äù ***** &gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he is still cautious about the improvement, though earnings were not as bad as expected, the Fed has cut rates and the trade situation appears to be improving. ‚ÄúThat combined with green shoots on the macro front, the markets have really taken that and run with it,‚Äù he said, adding the move may have been too optimistic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out-sized relative to the significance of the data.‚Äù ***** &gt; Suzuki said he needs to see more proof that U.S. manufacturing has stabilized, as many believe. ISM manufacturing was better in October than in September, but it is still in contraction. ‚ÄúWhy is this definitely the bottom? The jury‚Äôs still out,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think you have to answer the question‚Äîif this is the bottom and growth is going to rebound here, what‚Äôs going to be the catalyst for that?...I don‚Äôt see anything in the data that suggests there‚Äôs going to be a big rebound for any of those fronts. I see more headwinds to growth than I see tail winds,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOn the investment side, it would be highly unusual to see a big rebo *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/T9SjE20.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8W9ZEl5.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/M3xj6y3.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/CDu5j2z.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SH0TeO4.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lGdKQEl.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4RTYjep.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lOVhDyS.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aW0lS66.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O3s4dVY.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dMDoRsO.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WxSpwUo.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EebP9sl.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zPoRUCo.png))**  *****  # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Best  &gt; DJIA has been up 10 of the last 15 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 13 of the last 17 years with an average gain of 0.45%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it‚Äôs different.  &gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 16 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 15 and 14 times respectively over the past 25 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday‚Äôs solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the usually bullish Thanksgiving holiday.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ddb01f5c5a1394eef94bd7aebb45ec03/b8ff67da753d6f7d-4d/s500x750/2aa2aaad32dfe69d74cec31a5ad82977f508bfdc.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64c54950be5f6a806b01c37b50dd5d7a/b8ff67da753d6f7d-21/s500x750/94106d19c10e8a12801433b92ed4be45e23172f3.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/880280373bfa4f8cf907dae5f09f967b/b8ff67da753d6f7d-16/s500x750/d9dc811e236fae9469ba19e049d8deced8a69c6f.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/112c36b256229af09a0aecd62de1d43a/b8ff67da753d6f7d-6c/s500x750/d59184149988d737e8a7e8cbc3ccfdf963bb4521.jpg))**  *****  # S&amp;P 500 Price vs 50-DMA  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been on a seemingly uninterrupted run higher over the last several days, but by some measures, it may not be as extended as you would think. The chart below shows the historical percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500 and its 50-day moving average (DMA) over the last three years. Through Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 was 3.2% above its 50-DMA, which is relatively high but nowhere near an extreme. The red line in the chart below shows the current percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500's price and its 50-DMA. There have been a number of times since the 2016 election where this spread was higher with the most recent being back in July. In fact, 17% of all prior days in the last three years have seen the S&amp;P 500 close at a higher level relative to its 50-DMA than it is now. That doesn't mean the market isn't overbought, but it's not exactly at unprecedented levels either.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110719-50-DMA-Spread.png))**  *****  # Leaders and Laggards Since FOMC  &gt; We've now had nearly a full week of trading since last Wednesday's FOMC meeting where Fed Chair Powell suggested that the punch bowl isn't going to be taken away anytime soon. During that time, we've seen a real shift in leadership as defensive sectors have sold off while cyclical sectors have been on fire. Energy - yes, Energy - has been the top-performing sector with a gain of 3.5% while Industrials aren't far behind with a gain of 2.8%, Behind these two, Technology and Financials have also comfortably outperformed the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.2%. On the downside, Real Estate and Utilities, two of the market's most popular sectors for much of 2019 due to their dividend yields, have both dropped over 1% while Consumer Staples and Health Care have also sold off.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC.png))**  &gt; Due to the fact that we are also in the thick of earnings season, it's a bit more difficult to see how the Fed's actions last week impacted individual stocks as some of the best and worst performances over the last week have been earnings-related. With that caveat, the tables below list the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the last week. Starting off with the winners, three S&amp;P 500 stocks are up over 20% in the last week, and all three were due to earnings reports. Overall, 12 stocks have rallied over 10%, while all 25 of the top performers are up over 7%. In terms of sector representation on the list, nearly a third (8) of the stocks on the list are from the Technology sector, while another five come from the Consumer Discretionary sector. The remaining 12 stocks on the list come from five different sectors.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC-Stocks.png))**  &gt; On the downside, 8 of the 25 worst performers since last week's FOMC meeting are down over 10% with Arista Networks (ANET) losing nearly a quarter of its value. Again, ANET's decline was tied to an earnings report as opposed to a reaction to the FOMC. In terms of overall sector representation, though, the underperformance of the Real Estate sector highlighted above is also evident on this list as eight of the companies listed come from that sector.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC-Stocks-Bad1.png))**  *****  # The Few, the Lowly, the Laggards  &gt; With less than two months left to go in 2019, the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on a gain of nearly 23% YTD, and all but two of the index's 24 industry groups are up by at least double-digit percentages. The two laggards are Energy (+4.5%) and Drugs and Biotechs (+5.5%), while the three strongest groups are all from the Technology sector (Tech Hardware: +44.8%, Semis: +37.7%, and Software: +32.8%). Surprisingly enough, Banks are even starting to move up the performance list as that group is up just a hair under 30% on the year putting it in fifth place on a YTD basis.  &gt; The table below lists where each of the S&amp;P 500's Industry Groups is currently trading with respect to its 50-DMA. While you would expect just about everything to be extended after the recent leg higher, that's not the case. The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is just 3% above its 50-DMA, and just five groups are more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. The two most extended groups are Tech Hardware (think Apple) and Banks. On the downside, there are actually as many Industry Groups trading below their 50-DMAs as there are groups trading more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. As shown at the bottom of the table, Consumer Services, Real Estate, Household &amp; Personal Products, Commercial Services, and Utilities are all currently below their 50-DMAs. These aren't groups that have been lagging the market all year. In fact, three of them are outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, but in the majority of cases, these are defensive-oriented groups that have fallen out of favor as the market's sentiment has shifted and rates have risen.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-Groups-vs-50DMA.png))**  *****  # Seasonally Strong Period, But‚Ä¶  &gt; As I head to Las Vegas for my annual pilgrimage to @MoneyShows TradersEXPO I am both thrilled and shocked to hear everybody on Wall Street and the financial media talking about bullish yearend market seasonality and practically every one of them has used the phrase, ‚Äúseasonally strong period.‚Äù  &gt; I‚Äôm thrilled because it validates what we already know and what I live and breathe: that there are clear evidence-based results of real, consistent, tradable and investable seasonal market patterns. I am shocked at how late many of them are to the party. We‚Äôve been in bullish Best Six Months mode since our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on October 11.  &gt; Since our October 11 Buy Signal we have tactically maneuvered out of our defensive positions in Bonds, Cyclicals, Utilities and others and into the main U.S. equity index ETFs: DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM and the gamut of seasonally strong growth sectors over three weeks ago. We also put out a brand new Stock Basket of undervalued growth stocks under Wall Street‚Äôs radar.  &gt; Market seasonality is clearly firing on all pistons as it has been all year, but everyone‚Äôs is jumping on the seasonal bandwagon just a two regular seasonal soft patches are about to come around on the calendar. Now that our Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy is complete with some big market gains at the end of October and the beginning of November we are on the lookout for weakness ahead of Thanksgiving.  &gt; Next week is two weeks before Thanksgiving and we‚Äôve shown in several recent posts, it is part of the mid-November soft patch. Then stocks usually pick up in anticipation of Thanksgiving and continue to rally through the end of November. After thanksgiving watch out, the first couple weeks of December are notoriously choppy and not especially bullish as tax-loss selling kicks into high gear.  &gt; With the market elevated and the news ever changing, stocks will be vulnerable to these perennial weak spots.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9aaf89d899bbee687003cb0682c09abf/ecf451b4b25f113b-b6/s500x750/e3c92bd4b5fc98e3dbb9e7d29c29cf33e1ba3f46.jpg))**  *****  # Presidential Cycle Stars Align for Stocks in 2020  &gt; Despite all of the geopolitical events, things still look good for stocks next year with an incumbent running. The potential for a decent trade truce with China, along with an economy that‚Äôs still growing and accommodative interest rates add up to a continuation of the bull market.  &gt; With the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2020 coming off the press this week here‚Äôs a little preview of some our analysis and outlook that‚Äôs in the 53rd Annual Edition.  &gt; Presidential incumbency is a powerful phenomenon and the driving force behind the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle. This quadrennial quadrille is what has made the Pre-Election Year the best year of the cycle and Election Year second best. Since 1952 S&amp;P 500 is up 12.5% on average in election years when a sitting president is running for reelection vs. 6.7% in all election years and ‚Äì1.5% in election years with an open field and no incumbent commander-in-chief running for a second term.  &gt; We are also arguably now experiencing some fiscal and monetary policy synchronicity. After several years of conflicting policy the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Federal government are finally getting in synch. Interest rates are historically low and the Fed has lowered rates again at the last three scheduled FOMC meetings at the same time as fiscal policy has been lowering taxes and increasing spending. These dual pro-growth policies should continue to propel the stock market higher.  &gt; Gains will of course not come without pause and correction. The world stage will continue to feature some challenging geopolitical, political, diplomatic, trade-related and economic storylines. U.S. presidential campaign politics will increasingly focus on domestic political disputes, standoffs and unfinished business ‚Äì as well as impeachment proceedings. But when all is said and done, we expect 2020 to be a positive year based on the historical patterns and cycles and current favorable policies, healthy economics, and positive market behavior.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c3138ccd5b75c444f49bf38d8641aae/be9c67ae504a288a-b7/s500x750/4deb375459e69d486ef7b4a332fd6c83a72bbe04.jpg))**  *****  # Pre-Election Year Patterns: A November Market Pause  &gt; Now that we‚Äôve survived Octoberphobia and the market has begun to strengthen again, breaking out above resistance and logging new highs on DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we are likely to experience a bit of consolidation here in November. Normally the top S&amp;P month of the year and #2 for DJIA, NASDAQ and the Russell 2000, November has been weaker in Pre-Election Years.  &gt; As you can see in the updated chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns overlaid with 2019 we have been tracking all year November tends to be flat in the Pre-Election Year with a pop around Thanksgiving. Then after the usual first half of December softness the market tends to push toward additional new highs near yearend. Considering the banner performance so far this year and the uncanny tracking of this historical seasonal pattern, we expect the stock to consolidate over the next few weeks and then resume its march higher.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c92e9d54472dae57c42e5409e73c6f4/a550a7d5128bc21b-16/s500x750/e8904a77d4f88b26e957977cc8cb16c7d259cd9a.jpg))**  *****  # Bulls Stay in Motion  &gt; ‚ÄúAn object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.‚Äù Sir Isaac Newton  &gt; What a year it has been for the bulls. The S&amp;P 500 Index recently made four more new highs, and it‚Äôs up more than 20% for the year (as of Nov. 4). This leads to the big question: What could happen in the final two months of 2019? Well, we think the bulls might like it.  &gt; ‚ÄúA good year tends to see continued strong performance the final two months of the year,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIn fact, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up 20% or more for the year heading into the usually bullish November, stocks have never dropped in November, while December also has tended to see a strong upward bias.‚Äù  &gt; As the LPL Chart of the day shows, going back to 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% heading into November, then the final two months were up an average of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has also never fallen in the final two months of the year after closing October up more than 20% for the year.  &gt; This phenomenon could be due to portfolio managers buying to play catch-up, or it could be that an object in motion stays in motion, as Newton noted more than 300 years ago.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/could-a-year-end-rally-be-in-store_1.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 8th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.10.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeNGIjBSab4))**  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aW0lS66.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/GgFO1SY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/otYqetu.png))**  *****  Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 11.11.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyCiz80.png))  &gt; # ***Monday 11.11.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KwAHPOA.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 11.12.19 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YGs5Jtz.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 11.12.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oFKkf5r.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 11.13.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1MaDyTI.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 11.13.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jl7HAe5.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 11.14.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4e9xTRR.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 11.14.19 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Y8hsYWQ.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 11.15.19 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/syBXqif.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 11.15.19 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) NONE.  *****  # DISCUSS!

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.  # **It‚Äôs getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)** ***** &gt; As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it‚Äôs very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators. ***** &gt; Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday. ***** &gt; Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm. ***** &gt; # Top months ahead for stocks &gt; November is the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&amp;P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúInvestors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They‚Äôre too skeptical that the market can advance,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,‚Äù Stovall said. ***** &gt; Of the more than 350 S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThis will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they‚Äôre going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That‚Äôs not good,‚Äù said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we‚Äôre underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared. ***** &gt; The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today‚Äôs move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,‚Äù said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs move lends some power to the bulls.‚Äù ***** &gt; Redler said Apple‚Äôs performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. ‚ÄúTraders love when Apple leads the way,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&amp;P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398. ***** &gt; Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that‚Äôs been developing for weeks, it‚Äôs really been this rotation toward cyclicals,‚Äù said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat. ***** &gt; He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. ‚ÄúWe think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; # What are bonds saying? &gt; The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there‚Äôs a lot of enthusiasm about it,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúThe bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.‚Äù ***** &gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,‚Äù said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. ‚ÄúI think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.‚Äù ***** &gt; However, Stovall said it‚Äôs a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&amp;P 500, now about 2%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&amp;P has exceeded 22%,‚Äù he said. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fMSMfhh.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zk6ZCDD.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Ory2tKZ.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vDtIzbr.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kgoXJ3b.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xE5ngtV.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z6KfVTK.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohfhFMl.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aw5n74R.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c6iyCwq.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLfqEJs.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4lgiA2G.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PgvRk8F.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zKsPBmS.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/nnvJEBa.png))**  *****  # Typical November Trading: First Month of ‚ÄúBest Months‚Äù  &gt; November‚Äôs long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&amp;P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA‚Äôs record matches S&amp;P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA‚Äôs second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).  &gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November‚Äôs average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9faf85e2a54e356f1c29214261f03fa/bc2631ef216e46d9-31/s500x750/2c6005f0edfe2e0b6025767f1183dd1afd1b3235.jpg))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19  &gt; It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.  &gt; The Chicago Fed‚Äôs National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed‚Äôs Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board‚Äôs reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday‚Äôs GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP‚Äôs stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices‚Äîunlike Markit‚Äîare still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**  &gt; The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday‚Äôs reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today‚Äôs ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM‚Äôs Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week‚Äôs weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan‚Äôs preliminary November data.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-2.png))**  *****  # Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe  &gt; Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**  &gt; Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.  &gt; Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&amp;P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.  &gt; Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**  &gt; Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-table2.png))**  *****  # Guidance Trends Lower  &gt; Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).  &gt; Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.  &gt; A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis.

Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**  &gt; The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.  &gt; Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we‚Äôd like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.‚Äù  &gt; Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 1st, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9rfOCG3orw))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.3.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt;

Underlying optimism that the U.S. and China are reportedly on track with trade deal progress has helped sentiment. On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28. Separately, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she expects growth in Hong Kong to be negative in 2019. Tokyo's core CPI came in softer than expected in October, with the effects of the sales tax hike garnering some attribution for the weakness.  * In economic data:    * South Korea's November Manufacturing BSI Index 74 (last 73)    * Tokyo October CPI +0.4% yr/yr (last +0.4%); Tokyo core CPI +0.5% yr/yr (expected +0.7%; last +0.5%)  \---Equity Markets---  * **Japan's Nikkei:** \+0.5% * **Hong Kong's Hang Seng:** \-0.4% * **China's Shanghai Composite:** \-0.9% * **India's Sensex:** \+1.5% * **South Korea's Kospi:** \-0.04% * **Australia's ASX All Ordinaries:** \+0.1%  \---FX---  * USD/JPY: unch at 108.92 * USD/CNH: -0.03% to 7.0624 * USD/INR: +0.2% to 70.898  **Europe**: DAX -0.2%, FTSE -0.9%, CAC -0.1%  Major European indices are experiencing modest losses, as buyers have been a reluctant bunch in today's trading action. Earnings news has failed to whet their appetite, with oil giant BP and packaging firm Stora Enso among the luminaries weighing on the bourses after reporting results that failed to please investors. The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn't in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31. The British pound had been weaker earlier, but has gained some ground following the report.  * In economic data:    * UK's October Nationwide HPI +0.2% m/m (last -0.2%); +0.4% yr/yr (expected +0.2%; last +0.2%); BoE September Consumer Credit GBP0.828B (expected GBP0.88B; last GBP 0.969B)    * France's October Consumer Confidence 104 (expected 104; last 104)    * Spain's September Retail Sales +0.1% m/m (expected +0.5%; last +0.2%); +3.4% yr/yr (expected +3.2%; last +3.3%)    * Italy's September PPI +0.1% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.4%); -1.7% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -1.4%)  \---Equity Markets---  * **STOXX Europe 600:** \-0.4% * **Germany's DAX:** \-0.2% * **U.K.'s FTSE 100:** \-0.9% * **France's CAC 40:** \-0.1% * **Italy's FTSE MIB:** \-0.1% * **Spain's IBEX 35:** \-0.5%  \---FX---  * EUR/USD: -0.2% to 1.1080 * GBP/USD: +0.03% to 1.2864 * USD/CHF: +0.1% to 0.9956  **DISCLAIMER: ALL CONTENT COURTESY OF** [**ATOM FINANCE**](https://atom.finance)**!**"|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|694895|public|confidence|self|||Morning Briefing (10/29/2019)|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dopllz/morning_briefing_10292019/|no_ads|0||||dark|||||[]|1572441087.0||||2019-10-29|GM

The benchmark index could also open the busy week near its record highs that it almost hit on Friday.¬†  Dow component **Walgreens Boots Alliance**¬†(**WBA** 56.30, +0.88, +1.6%) is up nicely in pre-market action after it beat earnings expectations. Regarding Brexit, the EU has reportedly agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to Jan. 31 and would allow for an earlier exit if UK lawmakers approve the withdrawal plan in the interim.  Looking ahead, this week's biggest events will include **Alphabet's** (**GOOG** 1275, +9.87, +0.8%) earnings report after today's close, followed by **Apple's** (**AAPL** 247.40, +0.82, +0.3%) and **Facebook's** (**FB** 187.25, -0.64, -0.3%) after Wednesday's close; the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday; and the¬†Employment Situation Report for October on Friday.

Today will be limited to the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for September at 8:30 a.m. ET.¬†  U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve.

last -1.7%)    * In data:       * Investor sentiment was boosted by a Xinhua press report that suggested the U.S. and China have made progress on the text of a ""Phase One"" trade agreement.¬†This news overshadowed China reporting a weaker than expected drop in industrial profits in September, and just about everything else in a session that lacked meaningful news drivers.       * The BOJ policy decision sits on the near horizon with an Oct. 30-31 meeting date.¬†This decision will follow hot on the heels of the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting. * Major European indices aren't showing a lot of vigor to start the new week, although the positive mood surrounding U.S-China trade talks has been a supportive factor on the margin.¬†STOXX Europe 600 -0.1%, Germany's DAX +0.4%, U.K.'s FTSE 100 -0.04%, France's CAC 40 +0.1%, Italy's FTSE MIB +0.1%, Spain's IBEX 35 unch.¬†    * In economic data:       * Germany's September Import Price Index +0.6% m/m (expected +0.2%;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.  # **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market‚Äôs return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report. ***** &gt; Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead. ***** &gt; In a week stacked with major events, the Fed‚Äôs two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it‚Äôs time to pause, as some economists expect. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúOur view is they‚Äôll be done after this. We‚Äôre not expecting a cut in December, and we‚Äôre not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it‚Äôs stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,‚Äù said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. ‚ÄúI do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn‚Äôt be cutting at all.‚Äù ***** &gt; But Matus‚Äô view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday. ***** &gt; All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be choppy going into the Fed,‚Äù said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high. ***** &gt; In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&amp;P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own. ***** &gt; # Big economic reports  &gt; On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month. ***** &gt; Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company‚Äôs manufacturing operations. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,‚Äù said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf it turns up, I think that‚Äôs to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%. ***** &gt; # Stocks at ‚Äòinflection point‚Äô  &gt; Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial‚Äôs chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it‚Äôs about to get ‚Äúless bad.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚Ä≥‚Ä≥Less bad‚Äô is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,‚Äù she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November. ***** &gt; ‚Ä≥‚ÄòI‚Äôm not bullish. I‚Äôm not bearish. I‚Äôm optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You‚Äôre starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It‚Äôs telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets ‚Äòless bad‚Äô you‚Äôre going to see that it‚Äôs being reflected in this inflection point in the market,‚Äù said said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we‚Äôre seeing a steepening of the yield curve.‚Äù ***** &gt; The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning. ***** &gt; The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf it pushes through 1.80, you‚Äôre going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,‚Äù Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher. ***** &gt; The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. ‚ÄúI think most people think one more cut and done,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.‚Äù ***** &gt; # ‚ÄòGreater optimsim‚Äô in market  &gt; Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. ‚ÄúThe data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there‚Äôs no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there‚Äôs greater optimism,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; Of the approximately 200 S&amp;P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported. ***** &gt; Paulsen said there‚Äôs some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election. ***** &gt; Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. ‚ÄúA no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that‚Äôs significant,‚Äù Ablin said. ‚ÄúI think investors are underplaying it because it‚Äôs so binary. It‚Äôs hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.‚Äù *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mMPvzgL.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qfH6cuI.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fl3u1U.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/d0KYXSh.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mQYD2ay.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fARcwR4.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NPhYaGZ.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JwfHb1k.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5DjAHjt.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aJoKnw0.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3GQMBSo.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4zFdNBR.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Oj3izCL.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/4BShjBk.png))**  *****  # Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy Treat Next Week  &gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 25 years. From the tables below: * Dow up 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.4%. * S&amp;P up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.5%. * NASDAQ up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.7%, median gain 2.3%. * Russell 2000 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.2%, median gain 2.5%.  &gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course ‚ÄúSell in May‚Äù. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac that most of the market‚Äôs gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.  &gt; Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks. But the next seven days have been a historically bullish trade.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1e3780903ab0320558e5b3ae4cafa9/3e97f22823802fb9-ff/s500x750/ffa25c2f95af2a97ef6221e68e45ac6440ef27c7.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa30c86f2cd7f4fcd6d4b1a15e0fab60/3e97f22823802fb9-94/s500x750/c2b10b503a894dc86252e11a5fb6f2cc5d4db968.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eca76e887e3c4186b3c55ca9206185c2/3e97f22823802fb9-da/s500x750/4a107f95210b6c105423dc027eca75dd1adb3059.jpg))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a36c7df7c5263b070c39990b16774d83/3e97f22823802fb9-36/s500x750/e020f6bed981a0daa21ba07242dcdb916340349b.jpg))**  *****  # Normally a top month, November has been lackluster in Pre-Election Years  &gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down ‚Äì22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ‚Äôs second worst month on record‚Äîonly October 1987 was worse.  &gt; November begins the ‚ÄúBest Six Months‚Äù for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don‚Äôt really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000‚Äôs (since 1979).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**  &gt; In pre-election years, November‚Äôs performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November‚Äôs weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.  *****  # Q4 Rally Is Real. Don‚Äôt Let 2018 Spook You  &gt; Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.  &gt; Historically, the ‚ÄúSweet Spot‚Äù of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.  &gt; Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&amp;P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&amp;P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.  &gt; Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&amp;P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday‚Äôs post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbbf895b45f184b03a00b205d9d5fb01/50dce02940c8c467-9c/s500x750/aa060bb5f968ea0e9de159e18bbf348ab8f21ee0.jpg))**  *****  # 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever  &gt; ‚ÄúEverything is awesome, when you‚Äôre living out a dream.‚Äù The Lego Movie  &gt; As the S&amp;P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, ‚Äúawesome‚Äù.  &gt; First, let‚Äôs look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&amp;P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.  &gt; ‚ÄúAs bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/great-year-for-assets_1.png?ssl=1))**  *****  # An Early Look at Earnings  &gt; We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**  &gt; Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**  &gt; We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.  &gt; In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsbeatrate.png))**  *****  # Banks - On To The Next Test  &gt; It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.  &gt; In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**  &gt; Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8). In the slightly more than two weeks since the index's short-term low, every stock in the index is up and up by at least 4%. That's a pretty broad rally!  &gt; Leading the way to the upside, State Street (STT) has rallied nearly 20%, while First Republic (FRC), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Bank of America (BAC) have jumped more than 13%. In the case of STT, the rally of the last two-weeks has also moved the stock into the green on a YTD basis.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks-List.png))**  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 25th, 2019**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKLdI1JvVH8))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.27.19** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70pZzT9B_o))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt;

The S&amp;P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value.¬†  Amazon's earnings results came up short of expectations, and it guided down Q4 profit and revenue below consensus. On the positive side, Dow components **Intel** (**INTC** 54.43, +2.20, +4.2%), **Visa** (**V** 177.64, +1.48, +0.8%), and **Verizon** (**VZ** 61.25, +0.67, +1.1%) all beat earnings expectations.  Other than earnings news, headlines about China's willingness to purchase more agricultural products and the EU leaning on the side of a Brexit extension have seemingly given investors some thinking to do on these prolonged situations. Neither has had much sway on the market today.¬†  Economic data will be sparse, with the final reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for October (Briefing.com consensus 95.8) due out at 10:00 a.m. ET.¬†  U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 97.68. WTI crude is down 0.2%, or $0.10, to $56.13/bbl.¬†  In U.S. Corporate news:  * **Amazon**¬†(AMZN 1680.00, -100.78): -5.7% after missing earnings estimates and guiding down Q4 profit and revenue below consensus.¬† * **Intel**¬†(INTC 54.43, +2.20): +4.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and issuing upside guidance for Q4 and FY19.¬† * **Visa**¬†(V 177.64, +1.48): +0.8% after beating earnings estimates and raising its dividend 20%.¬† * **Verizon**¬†(VZ 61.25, +0.67): +1.1% after beating earnings expectations.¬† * **Anheuser-Busch InBev** (BUD 84.23, -7.37): -8.1% after missing top and bottom-line estimates.¬† * **V.F.

The options are dirt fuckin' cheap and the stock itself has been relatively stable, leading to potentially great earnings on iron condors or whatever have you. I certainly wouldn't say you should buy their stock because I'm a Michigan boy and we've been burned by them one too many times to begin with, also this is WSB who the FUCK buys stocks these days when the tendies are in options?  That said I believe this upcoming earnings report on Wednesday (10/23) is the perfect opportunity for it to either rally or fall. It's been a very tough quarter for auto makers in the U.S. due to the strikes but that was mostly GM who took the brunt of the hit (hint: $GM 10/29). HOWEVER Ford itself is like the ugly kid on the play ground and despite everything his competitor's face he's the one who gets bullied by the chad stonk investors.   Today it was downgraded by [some nerds](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/98f50487-0458-3227-9ed7-404245c16afe/ford-stock%3A-valuengine.html) from 'sell' to 'strong sell' but of course this isn't priced in to the earnings call. What prompted this was the botched release of some [boomer-mobile](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-botches-explorer-launch-putting-100000028.html) which is believed to drive the stock downward much further. This won't effect this quarter either, so be sure to put your puts in for next earnings.  It's been a shitty quarter for all automakers, but I think that will ultimately be Ford's best bet at a rally on Wednesday, as compared to their counterparts they've had a quite tame time. At the same time I don't trust them one single fuckin' bit to pull through. This quarter is make or break for the stock to get past 10$, or consign itself as a penny stock at sub $5.  Having mixed feelings, I'm running a strangle and hoping it goes down as the calls were less expensive than the puts and therefore I stand to earn more. If you're new and take the religious route of inversing WSB, an iron condor is what you want but if you're Iron Condor'ing on earnings week you definitely belong here.  That all being said, next earnings if they continue to have a rough time it'll definitely be worth considering some major OTM puts.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|686581|public|confidence|self|||$F for Ford?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl7q76/f_for_ford/|no_ads|0|||||||||[]|1572180843.0||||2019-10-21|GM

It's Casey and Eshaan from RCR biotech, we're a medical student and neurobiology/business school student that helps try to identify biotech companies/drugs we find potentially lucrative, and explain the mechanism, logistics, etc. as simply as possible. Last week we posted asking for companies you wanted DD on. We're still going through the comments and selecting a few that we like. In the process, we stumbled upon an antibiotic &amp; company we really liked, and wanted to share that information with you. Below is our newest blog post.  **TLDR- Summary &amp; Thoughts**  In summary, Baxdela (Melinta Therapeutics; MLNT) is an FDA-approved drug for skin infection that has a PDUFA date on October 24th for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.¬† Baxdela comes from a class of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) that is used frequently to treat pneumonia.¬† However, its unique chemical structure makes it more potent at sites of infection compared to other antibiotics in its family. ¬†Previous Phase 3 trials show non-inferiority (which is good) compared to expensive, ‚Äúbig gun‚Äù antibiotics in the treatment of skin infections.¬† Additionally, those clinical trials also suggest Baxdela is fairly well-tolerated by patients.¬† In turn, this drug represents a novel antibiotic in the time of rising rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (which causes \~$84billion/year of health care charges). While we got in the game a bit late (\~$3.89/share), we still think Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT) will continue to rise up to- and after the PDUFA date on October 24th.¬†  \*\*\*Disclaimer- we own a whopping \~$23 worth of MLNT shares, so do with that information what you will\*\*\* (residency applications were expensive lol)  **FULL POST**  **What it is**‚Äì  Baxdela (Delafloxacin) is a novel fluoroquinolone antibiotic produced by Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT). Fluoroquinolones are one several different types of antibiotics, including:  1. Sulfonamides 2. Beta-lactams (ie. penicillin, ampicillin) 3. Tetracylins (ie. doxycycline) 4. Macrolides 5.

It's Casey and Eshaan from RCR biotech, we're a medical student and neurobiology/business school student that help try to identify biotech companies/drugs we find potentially lucrative, and explain the mechanism, logistics, etc. as simply as possible. Last week we posted asking for companies you wanted DD on. We're still going through the comments and selecting a few that we like. In the process, we stumbled upon an antibiotic &amp; company we really liked, and wanted to share that information with you. Below is our newest blog post from [rcrbiotech.com](https://rcrbiotech.com/).  **TLDR- Summary &amp; Thoughts**  In summary, Baxdela (Melinta Therapeutics; MLNT) is an FDA-approved drug for skin infection that has a PDUFA date on October 24th for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.¬† Baxdela comes from a class of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) that is used frequently to treat pneumonia.¬† However, its unique chemical structure makes it more potent at sites of infection compared to other antibiotics in its family. ¬†Previous Phase 3 trials show non-inferiority (which is good) compared to expensive, ‚Äúbig gun‚Äù antibiotics in the treatment of skin infections.¬† Additionally, those clinical trials also suggest Baxdela is fairly well-tolerated by patients.¬† In turn, this drug represents a novel antibiotic in the time of rising rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (which causes \~$84billion/year of health care charges).

Friday's announcement about a partial trade deal being reached with China invited speculation about how much was really accomplished. To that point, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are not willing to sign the ""phase one"" deal without more discussions. President Trump, however, has already pushed back, saying that China will immediately increase its purchases of agricultural products from the U.S. and that the phase one deal can be finalized and signed soon.  Markets in Europe trade in negative territory, pressured in part by renewed concerns about the likelihood of a Brexit deal being reached.  Participants will not receive any economic data today and the bond market is closed for Columbus Day.  The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% at 98.46 while crude oil is down 2.0% at $53.60/bbl.

Commodities were in focus after a Saturday attack on two refineries in Saudi Arabia. Early reports suggested that the attack impacted roughly 5% of total global oil output while a more recent report indicated that Saudi Arabia expects that roughly a third of the lost production will be restored before Tuesday. Crude oil surged more than 15.0% at the Sunday open, and is currently up 8.3% at $59.41/bbl. China's reserve requirement ratio cut went into effect while the latest set of economic data from China disappointed. *Reuters* reported that China was behind a cyber attack on Australia's parliament and main political parties prior to an election in May, but Australia's government did not make a public accusation due to a fear that the country's trade relationship with China would be impacted.

The S&amp;P 500 enters today's session less than 20 points from that level, helped by a view that trade tensions will not worsen in the short term, U.S. consumer spending will support further growth, and that easy monetary policy will continue to favor equities.¬†  Today's trade news involves China's *Xinhua News Agency* confirming that China will encourage companies to buy certain agricultural products like pork and soybeans from the U.S. without being subject to additional tariffs. Separately, President Trump teased the idea that he would consider an interim agreement with Beijing but said he would rather have a complete deal.  Economic data today will feature the Retail Sales report for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, which will give investors an updated view on the U.S. consumer.  Import and Export Prices for August will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and the preliminary September reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment (Briefing.com consensus 90.2) at 10:00 a.m. ET.¬†  U.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.74%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 98.03.

Despite a [$1.1 Billion fine from the EU](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-tech-google-tax/google-to-pay-1-billion-in-france-to-settle-fiscal-fraud-probe-idUSKCN1VX1SM?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29) for fiscal fraud in a case started 4 years ago.  On top of a that, a [5 billion fine last year](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust).  And there was even a YouTube fine announced this week for [$170 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html) for violating children‚Äôs privacy laws, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt them in the slightest.  Over the past 5 years they‚Äôre still up over 100% and have effectively doubled in share price. The fines have grown for their malfeasance, but it isn‚Äôt slowing them down.  Is this usual?   I have also noticed that another company, Boeing, despite not having a viable civilian product in aviation and being propped up by defense contracts and the 737 Max not being able to fly (or sell) has to be validated by multiple aviation administrations (EU doing its own evaluation). For all intents and purposes Boeing has a massive overhead cost right now: the 737 max *is the best selling aircraft in history that can‚Äôt fly* and many airlines are hurt from planes that have been delivered but can‚Äôt even use. Even a large order cancellation (48 planes cancelled by Garuda Indonesia, an almost $5.7 billion sale) didn‚Äôt hurt their stock very much. Same thing for flyadeal‚Äôs $5.9 billion order cancellation had almost no real impact on the stock.  GM currently is in the throes of a [3.4 million](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gm-brake-recall-gm-recalls-3-4-million-pickups-suvs-over-braking-problem/) vehicle recall due to *braking issues*, and their stock hasn‚Äôt seem affected by the recalls or even the tariffs. The recalls are primarily on their truck lines - their vehicles with their biggest profit margins, which will have shrunk considerably with how much it will cost to fix them and even hurt future sales with loss of consumer confidence.  By all logic the fines due to mistakes should be seriously hurting their stock as profitably takes a dive and they eat into cash to deal with the problems, but many of these companies seem ‚Äúimmune‚Äù.|True|False|True|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|650227|public|confidence|self|||Do fines/recalls affect stock price?|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3acuy/do_finesrecalls_affect_stock_price/|no_ads|0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'xUfo2scTSTL-ymhtEtwOYv9dnoyjtKGS0eY2X7JO9mI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JukJ709ivWqdXSJu--6Qktps0Zpd3bZdXILgC0BwVwQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a288bd0b69c9cc884be78a23693f5e5e1f3c9b10', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JukJ709ivWqdXSJu--6Qktps0Zpd3bZdXILgC0BwVwQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e08f8825ed0104e45341cfff7c9800ae610273c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JukJ709ivWqdXSJu--6Qktps0Zpd3bZdXILgC0BwVwQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ff99d492ab955298f388b44634b307c64e9151', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JukJ709ivWqdXSJu--6Qktps0Zpd3bZdXILgC0BwVwQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f01fb79f69ca6e5943ac7aefd9e78fbfdb4fe0c8', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JukJ709ivWqdXSJu--6Qktps0Zpd3bZdXILgC0BwVwQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=97cbda86304a138c626c14da047dc600aa5d029c', 'width': 800}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||[]|1568391910.0||||2019-09-12|GM

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 29th, 2019.  # **The Fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy, even though most signs are strong  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong.htmll)** ***** &gt; The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade Wednesday, a pre-emptive move as concerns rise about the impact of the trade wars and a slowing global economy. ***** &gt; Friday‚Äôs July jobs report should show that the U.S. economy is still strong, with 170,000 nonfarm payrolls being added and an extremely low unemployment rate of 3.7%, according to Refinitiv. That follows this past Friday‚Äôs report of second -quarter GDP, which grew at a better than expected 2.1% but showed clear signs of impact from tariffs and trade friction. ***** &gt; Stocks gained in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs, as investors anticipated a Fed rate cut, and also a better-than-expected earnings season. Earnings growth is slightly positive so far this quarter, but that could improve with another big wave of earnings in the week ahead, when nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 report. ***** &gt; Apple, Exxon Mobil, Procter and Gamble, Merck, General Motors and Verizonare among companies reporting. Beyond Meat, the hot IPO with a market cap bigger than a quarter of companies in the S&amp;P 500, reports Monday. Seventy-five percent of companies have beaten estimates so far and 60% beat revenue expectations. ***** &gt; It will be the Fed though that will likely have the most market impact, and strategists are looking for the central bank to signal it is open to future cuts but not necessarily promising them. Economists mostly expect anywhere from one to three rate cuts this year, but there is near consensus that this first cut will be a quarter percentage point. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. ‚ÄúWe already know of two Fed presidents who don‚Äôt think we need it, so there‚Äôs obviously going to be a discussion, with the strong data. The chairman, who is in the camp that we need to have an insurance cut, is going to make the case that while the economic data are all gaining strength, they are still worried about weakening conditions, due to uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs.‚Äù ***** &gt; The strains of the trade war and tariffs showed up in a reduction in gross private domestic investment in second quarter GDP of 5.5%, the worst decline in that category since 2015. Within that, exports fell 5.2%. The decline in business investment wiped a full percentage point from the final GDP number. ***** &gt; The Fed has boxed itself into moving rates, says JP Morgan US chief eocnomist ***** &gt; In the last several weeks, as the Fed meeting edged closer, economic data began to show signs of improvement from a soft patch this winter and spring. Consumers, who comprise 70% of the economy, strengthened in the second quarter, with consumption up 4.3%, its best reading since the fourth quarter of 2017. ***** &gt; The Fed ‚Äúwill signal they‚Äôre‚Äô going to go on if conditions warrant it. It‚Äôs clear the chairman and his cohorts are not looking at incoming data in the sense that they are data dependent. They made it clear they want to inoculate the economy,‚Äù Krosby said. ***** &gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint, said he expects the Fed to cut rates just once and then stop. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to say that we‚Äôre done. I think it would be too much of a leap for the market. My sense is they‚Äôll leave the door open, but their aim is not going to be locked in for the next meeting. It‚Äôs clearly a function of how the data play out,‚Äù Stanley said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just more optimistic than they are about the how things are going to evolve.‚Äù ***** &gt; Investors will also be watching for headlines on trade in the coming week, as the U.S. delegation returns to China for the first round of face to face talks since May. *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qIIO6nE.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RrxEssP.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/X3jETZh.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ZPrkyNm.png))**  # **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ptHTv4U.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DCcXfwD.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lxlltRX.png)**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jse4rUG.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SyyFomj.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IGWYNX7.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FFNwff2.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dKsX4FB.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ2dOjE.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/mn6JY5y.png))**  *****  # Next Week's Economic Indicators - 7/26/19  &gt; The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index kicked off this week's busy macroeconomic data slate on a disappointing note with a still negative reading that was below forecasts. Weak data continued to come in on Tuesday with FHFA home price growth slowing to 0.1% and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index reaching a multi-year low. Existing Home Sales also came in weaker. Preliminary Markit PMIs released on Wednesday came in below estimates and weaker than the previous month while the services portion saw the opposite results. The release of preliminary Durable Goods and Capital Goods on Thursday came in much stronger than both expectations and the May release. Meanwhile, weekly labor data once again came in at a multi-month low. We ended the week with stronger than expected GDP data, but it still showed the economy slowed versus the first quarter. Overall, economic data didn't have the greatest of weeks with over half of the indicators released weakening or coming in below estimates.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco1.png))**  &gt; Next week is a busy one when it comes to macroeconomic developments. The week starts off quiet with only the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity Index out on Monday. It is expected to rebound to -5 off its multiyear low of -12.1 from its June release. Things pick up on Tuesday with the release of personal income and spending data which are forecast to fall 0.1%. PCE data, Pending Home Sales, and consumer confidence will also be out that day. Ahead of Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show 170K added jobs in July, on Wednesday ADP will release their own employment data. Also on Wednesday, there will be an FOMC rate decision followed by a presser by Fed Chair Powell. Markets are anticipating a 25 bps cut in this meeting. After digesting the results of this meeting, on Thursday ISM will release their manufacturing report for July. In addition to the NFP report, the release of the June trade balance, factory orders, and the University of Michigan's sentiment data will all round out the week on Friday.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco2.png))**  *****  # The Bespoke Report -- Global Macro Outlook  &gt; This week we're outlining how we see the global economy at present, along with its influence on US interest rates, credit, commodities, and equity markets. One of the topics we discuss in detail is the strong performance of US GDP in Q2, which in addition to upward revisions from 2014-2018 also showed newly-reported Q2 growth that was far stronger than analyst estimates. Smaller-than-expected headwinds from trade and inventory and a massive surge in consumer spending helped push growth above expectations despite weak investment. With the Fed set to join the global central bank easing party at its July meeting, it's part of the reason to expect that the global backdrop is set to improve.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Bespoke-Report-Sample.png))**  *****  # The Closer: End of Week Charts -- 7/26/19  &gt; Looking for deeper insight on global markets and economics? In tonight's Closer sent to Bespoke clients, we recap weekly price action in major asset classes, update economic surprise index data for major economies, chart the weekly Commitment of Traders report from the CFTC, and provide our normal nightly update on ETF performance, volume and price movers, and the Bespoke Market Timing Model. We also take a look at the trend in various developed market FX markets.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-The-Closer-Sample.png))**  *****  # Financials Appear Poised For a Strong Second Half  &gt; After a disappointing start to the year, financials were the top performing sector in the second quarter.  And technical analysis suggests they may have more room to run.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fva1zL.png))**  &gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Financials Outperformance May Mark a Change in Trend, the relative performance of financials versus the S&amp;P 500 Index has broken a downtrend, which we see as a bullish technical signal. This tells us the technicals may now be aligning with our optimistic fundamental outlook for financials, which we highlighted in our Midyear Outlook 2019.  &gt; Financials‚Äô strong performance has continued a few weeks into July, with the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index and KBW Bank Index both outpacing the market thus far. Defensive areas of the market, including the utilities, real estate, and healthcare sectors, have all lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of the first quarter. We think cyclicals‚Äô outperformance could continue if economic fundamentals improve.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe rotation from defensive stocks, which have led for much of the past year, to more cyclical areas of the market, is not only healthy for the bull market, but should favor active managers who can overweight these sectors,‚Äù according to LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.  &gt; While we don‚Äôt anticipate broad market performance to be as strong in the second half of 2019, we believe that an overweight to financial stocks may offer an opportunity for suitable investors based on attractive valuations, a potentially steeper yield curve, and an improving technical picture.  *****  # August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great  &gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.  &gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts‚Äô rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**  &gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%‚Äîwhich is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts‚Äô average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.  *****  # Second-Half Pre-Election Year Blues Absent‚Ä¶So Far  &gt; A little over one week ago, we posted updated charts of historical pre-election year performance with 2019 overlaid for comparison. Like then DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are still comfortably above average for this time of a pre-election year when compared to historical data. Thus far earnings have supported a continuation of the rally. A 100% probability (according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch Tool as of today) that the Fed will cut rates at least 0.25% is also aiding. And now it appears the debt ceiling is going to be raised eliminating another market headwind.   It would seem the market has nearly everything going its way. Almost, sentiment is running on the frothy side. According to Investors Intelligence, bullish advisors have reached 58%, a new high for 2019, while bearish advisors are down to just 16.8%. Historically these levels have been an early warning. Combined with the historically meager gains in the second half of pre-election years (visible in the charts below), the rally appears to be increasingly prone to faltering. If the market does take a pause and consolidate some of its gains so far this year in August/September/early-October, it would likely improve the possibility of a respectable fourth quarter rally.  &gt;

This bad boy has been tanking steadily for 12 months.  Even as the market raged over that period, tariffs went in dry on these poor guys.  In May, support seemed to stabilize around $21.30.     At this time last year, AA was trading at $47.  In April of 2018 (prior to Trump's March 1 tariff announcement) AA was at $60.  Thru most of 2000 thru 2008, AA traded between $60 and $90.   Just as new construction started to take off with Trump's election and tax breaks, AA started to takeoff approaching prior glory of $60+ before the tariff slow bleed back to $21.   So during May's overall tumble, AA stabilizes around $21.  Today's vaguely optimistic Trump tweet about China saw AA spike 5%.   I started averaging in at $25...have held thru the continued slide.  I am hoping we've found the floor and are beginning the rebound.  Although it may be impossible to time a trade deal, given the preamble, AA ought to be poised for significant growth thereafter.   ------   Brief history on AA.  These guys supply a lot of aluminum to GM, Boeing, etc, and also produce aluminum components for new building construction.  They have an annual revenue of $11.6bn  They literally invented aluminum smelting a 130ish years ago and were founded 1888.  Their Pittsburgh chemistry experiment was financed by Andrew Mellon, an Ambassador to the UK and Treasury Secretary for 3 different Presidents.  They've been the consistent leader in their industry since inventing it and are the largest smelter in North America today.|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|572225|public|confidence|self|||AA -- Aluminum rebound is inbound.|0.0|||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c26h9z/aa_aluminum_rebound_is_inbound/|no_ads|0||||||||||1560971715.0||||2019-06-18|GM

If Chinese government were to make an example of punishing US companies for a revenge for Huawei, Tesla is a prime candidate to become a victim caught in the trade war. Here's why:  1. Tesla is pretty iconic US brand for future auto tech company. Punishing Tesla by banning any Tesla sale and production in China definitely will help Chinese own brand of electric car industry.  2. Tesla financial isnt in good shape. Any trouble can easily put more downward trend to the stock. Tesla depends so much in worldwide car sales to recoup the downward car sale trend in US.  3. Choosing Tesla would probably have desired effect as it hurts American brand but doesn't anger Trump enough to retaliate. Trump is never a fan of electric cars.

So here it is.  &amp;#x200B;  I may do these every Sunday, or this may be the first and last.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't fuck with options like some of you retards, just stocks for now. I'm also not autistic enough to day trade. I have a real job and social obligations (in case you're wondering, cry-shouting at your mum because she hasn't cleaned your CPAP machine doesn't count as socialising). So I stick to stocks and typically pick some on Sunday then close positions throughout the following week or the one after.  &amp;#x200B;  I usually focus on companies with market caps between 100M and 1 Bn, because they're more interesting and often volatile. I'm also bored of the same old $AAPL, $SNAP, $LYFT, $BABA, $MSFT ad nauseum circle-jerk. I like penny stocks if they poke their heads into dollar territory and I can see a good opportunity to brown bear dick them back down into oblivion. bear gang for life.  &amp;#x200B;  So, without further ado - here are my top 3 picks for the coming week, complete with big swinging DDs:  &amp;#x200B;  **$WKHS (BEAR - short term)**  &amp;#x200B;  I posted about this [earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmcyww/wkhs_penny_stock_up_200_today_because_of_a_trump/) and was completely ignored. Really hurt my feelings you guys, but because I love you i'm going to give you all a second run at the tendies. TL;DR is that this week Trump tweeted about Workhorse buying a vacant plant from $GM in Ohio, which pushed their stock price out of the pennies and over $2 in a few hours, based on absolutely nothing. From what I can see, Workhorse are a failing electric truck manufacturer trying to dig themselves out of a money hole by borrowing even more money and spending it stupidly. Trump made a big deal about the sale because it's Ohio and he wants to take credit for every job created there. Turns out the United Auto Workers (UAW) don't want the deal to go through and GM are contractually prohibited from closing or selling the plant until its current labour deal with the UAW expires in September. Plus Workhorse might not even have the money to buy the plant. All in all, a bunch of all caps hot air from Teflon Don. BUT... you didn't miss out on all the tendies. At $1.82 $WKHS is still an overweight date and dying for a dicking back into the pennies. I'm expecting a sharp sell off on Monday and will hopefully be closing by Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on how big a train the markets run on her.  &amp;#x200B;  1 caveat:  &amp;#x200B;  Workhorse are currently through to the final stage of a USPS competition to replace their old fleet of postal delivery vehicles. The winner should be announced very soon (maybe as soon as this week, since it's been delayed since 2018). If Workhorse win the contract, it'll be worth $6 Bn+ and absolutely rape my position. Competition is stiff, but I'm discounting everyone except for AM General and Workhorse. AM General are my favourites because they have the relationship with the federal government and the capacity / expertise to get the job done. Except for Workhorse and Oshkosh/Ford, all other competitors are foreign (Indian and Turkish). No way Teflon Don is giving this business to ~~ragheads~~ a non-US company this close to an election (MAGA). I'm discounting Ford because their design looks like dog shit and the proposed plant isn't in a swing state. As I said above, Workhorse are in Ohio. AM General are in Southbend, Indiana, another swing state. So, to my mind, Trump's **rational** play is to push USPS to give the deal to AM General and please Indiana state voters. Come September, he can still push GM to sell to Workhorse in Ohio to try and pick up votes there but by then i'll be on a boat in the Caribbean doing ketamine off midgets' painted feet so it's no skin of my perfectly smooth sack.  &amp;#x200B;  **$VCEL (BULL - mid-term)**  &amp;#x200B;  Vericel are a biopharm company specialising in therapies that aid tissue and organ repair. It's actually some pretty cool steam-punk tech that wouldn't be out of place in an Alien film or Demolition Man. Cell therapy to repair joints, biological skin graft and meshes to regrow organic tissue...it's cool. Most recently, this month they signed an exclusive deal with MediWound ($MDWD) to license and sell a burn gel (NexoBrid) in North America. The gel uses enzymes to remove burned tissue - in a phase II clinical trial, 93% of subjects experiencing complete removal of the damaged tissue. Great stuff. The deal with MediWound is performanced-based, so if the gel doesn't sell, VCEL won't be crippled by payments. Here's the really good bit: in Europe, you can't use this gel outside of specialist burn centres because it's too advanced for peasant use, but you yanks have a pretty lackadaisical approach to healthcare, which is why you're all hooked on pain pills and antidepressants. Anything that's restricted in Europe will sell like fucking cronuts state-side. Plus 75% of burn patients are treated at specialist centres in the US vs about a third in Europe. The icing on the cake is that VCEL dropped 8% after their Q1 earnings so i'm picking shares up at a discount. Will be seeing how things develop over the next few weeks / month either buying dips or closing if/when i'm up 15-20%. Bear in mind **FDA approval likely isn't until the end of 2020** \- if I had the patience I'd hold these guys for the long term but I know i'll just get bored. I'm looking to ride the recent positive sentiment up and then dump in a month or less.  &amp;#x200B;  **$VFF (BEAR - mid-term)**  &amp;#x200B;  Village Farms have had a good run recently. Nominally a fruit and veg grower, in 2017 they formed a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics, called Pure Sunfarms, to grow cannabis, . Pure Sunfarms is profitable and all looks hunky dory for now BUT:  &amp;#x200B;  1) Village Farms are one of the most inefficient cannabis growers out there, with crop yields of less than 100 grams per square foot. Average is 100 grams or more, but compare this to Flowr Corp which use genetics to boost yields to about 300 grams per square foot. It means Village Farms are likely to have higher production costs and lower margins.  &amp;#x200B;  2) Pure Sunfarms have yet to secure buyers for most of their product. Couple this with general market oversupply of weed and you have a recipe for crushed prices and dreams.  &amp;#x200B;  3) Village Farms stock price has jumped recently which means at best a correction and at worst a dump as investors realise there are much better growers out there.   &amp;#x200B;  The way the cannabis industry is going at the moment, we should expect a contraction as the mom and pop and have-a-go growers get squeezed out by WEED CORP. I think Village Farms had a great idea to diversify into a profitable product using their existing infrastructure, but growing weed isn't like growing tomatoes. They either take it seriously and upgrade their farms and up their yield, or they fade away and go back to aubergines full time.  &amp;#x200B;  Either way, I'm bearish in the short to mid term - hoping to close positions by the end of May, but may hang on a bit longer if weed prices take the downturn I'm expecting.  &amp;#x200B;  And that's it for this week.

I'm playing their upcoming earnings.    &amp;#x200B;  This is ""less than public"" knowledge as in most folks, including most investors, aren't going to know about it -- but it's still public if you know how to use the tools and interpret the information like I do.   &amp;#x200B;  I had no idea $TRUP existed until I saw a brochure at my vet's office.  I hate insurance, I'm not a fan of paying for something and getting a piece of paper to keep in my glove box (or wallet) in return.  I don't go to the doctor.  I don't get into car accidents (yet).  I just see some shit come out of my bank account so I can keep my ~~Mercedes~~ ~~Toyota~~ ~~Hyundai~~ GM legal.  I pay $200/mo just in case I fly with $BA and somehow survive a crash and need a doctor.  I love it.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, back to $TRUP.  When I was growing up poor we never took our dogs to the vet, we let them roam wild in the country like wolves.  I have to take my pit regularly now because the neighbor keeps requesting his ""up-to-date shot records"" -- I mean, do you need to see them after EVERY bite?   Jesus Christ man.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, pet insurance is something I actually use now.  And considering how much people love their pets, visits to the vet aren't something that take a huge hit in an economic downturn.  &amp;#x200B;  You can read all the stats about why this is and will be a booming industry in their investor presentation:  &amp;#x200B;  [https://s21.q4cdn.com/119804282/files/doc\_presentations/2019/03/TRUP-Investor-Presentation-March\_FINALv3.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/119804282/files/doc_presentations/2019/03/TRUP-Investor-Presentation-March_FINALv3.pdf)  &amp;#x200B;  Other than the great financials here and growth potential (pet insurance is common overseas, not yet adopted in the US yet), consider the information I'm offering.  Check out their organic search traffic over the past quarter (and beyond):  &amp;#x200B;  [https://imgur.com/dSFJdmq](https://imgur.com/dSFJdmq)  &amp;#x200B;  This is the ""less than public"" knowledge part.  This isn't inside information, this is an approximate of traffic and how it's increased over the past couple of years for Trupanion's main website.  You'll see how it's increased drastically over the past quarter and especially YOY.  &amp;#x200B;  The part of this is that organic traffic -- traffic that arrives on a website through Google, Bing (lol), etc -- is a relatively fixed cost (you pay the people to make it rank well, but the costs don't go up along with the traffic) is pure profit.  It's just money in the bank, they're not paid ads.  Organic traffic is also something that most analysts or ""pro"" investors can't forecast, Google organic search results are updated sporadically and like I said -- this isn't very public knowledge.  &amp;#x200B;  Until now.  I'm not suggesting what someone else should do, but I'm personally using this public-but-not-easily-found information to buy medium to long-range calls.  The history of this stock is incredibly healthy.  Not a meme stock.    &amp;#x200B;  I expect as we get close to the earnings report DD posts like this will popup and IV will go up as well..."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|538707|public|confidence|self|||DD: Trupanion ($TRUP) is a great short-term buy.

Which is insane, given GM's last mid-engine, mass produced vehicle was the Pontiac Fiero, an shitbox compared to today's cars.  Now i'm not saying load up on calls now, but it's something to look into come early 2020 when GM plans to unveil the new Corvette.

GM cannot sell these shares for 180 days due to the lockup period, but when this lockup period expires I strongly believe they will sell a significant amount of their shares because of a lack of cooperation between Lyft and GM as evidenced by Dan Ammann leaving the board on 2018 and GM veering towards working on their on robo-taxis(Cruise). The article I linked has quotes from several mid level GM shareholders expressing interest in GM selling their stake as well. Once GM sells their shares I think they'll either authorize share buybacks, a dividend, or invest in their own self driving tech through Cruise. Either way the balance sheet is going to look good and with the negative sentiment surrounding Lyft GM likely won't care about taking their money and leaving.

Both also stated that it's too early come to any conclusions. Oddly enough though, they've been working closely together to patch the MCAS software for months. This is the software many believe led to the Lion Air crash last year.  I've seen the arguments from the bulls here about the smoke and sputtering noises before the crash, leading some to believe that this is an isolated incident. The eerie similarity is in how the Ethiopian flight just decided to nose dive directly into the ground after [experiencing unstable vertical speed after takeoff](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1104671024581357568).  It's not crazy to think some kind of mechanical failure happened, the pilots attempted to compensate, and this piece of software decided it knew best and sent the jet crashing towards earth.  You'd have to be both retarded and blind not to recognize that both of these organizations understood the dangers of these jets, and continued to let them fly. 2 out of the (350) 737 MAX 8's in commercial use have violently nose dived mere minutes after take off. Killing every passenger and crew member in both instances. ROUGHLY .6% OF THESE FUCKING DEATH TRAPS HAVE EXPLODED WITH LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF USE UNDER THEIR BELT. That is insane.  &amp;#x200B;  So what's my point here? *Culpability.*  Both the FAA and $BA have stated that these planes are just fine, yet they're actively working to solve the safety issues. They've got nearly 400 fatalities on their hand at this point, have essentially admitted guilt with their condolences and software development, yet rather than admitting they fucked up the first time around, they're doubling down.  To make matters worse, take a look at the [insider trading records from the last few months](https://i.imgur.com/7OXK6B6.png). I suppose an argument could be made that these execs were just cashing in on historically high prices. What's really fucking odd though is the EVP and General Counsel to $BA gifted half of his shares to an undisclosed party, and the other half of his shares to his wife, who then transferred to a trust on October 29th 2018. Yes, that's the [date of the first 737 MAX 8 crash](https://i.imgur.com/yNaTwXK.png). What a coincidence. Then, a few weeks after the black box was dug out of the ocean, [he and his wife sell 8,500 shares, or 69% of their disclosed shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000122520819002329/xslF345X03/doc4.xml), on the open market. [It's worth noting that officials claimed it could take a few weeks to recover the data.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash/no-public-details-on-crashed-lion-air-voice-recorder-until-final-report-indonesian-official-idUSKCN1PG08R)  This is just one example. Go look up the other execs. Equally suspect shit going on with quite a few of the officers.  &amp;#x200B;  Who cares though, right? You should if you hold a bullish position on this stock. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, head of the House Transportation Committee, stated that  [""heads will roll at the FAA if they're not confident in their data and the safety of this plane""](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feinstein-blumenthal-lead-dem-pressure-on-boeing-after-deadly-ethiopian-airlines-crash).    If that happens, let's be real here, heads are gonna to roll at GM as well. Once the investigations start, shit is gonna hit the fan. Remember what happened to Ford with the whole [exploding pinto scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Legal_cases)? Around 1979  the corporation was *charged with murder,* paid a disclosed $128M ($450M today), and who knows how much they settled for out of court. Oh, and more importantly for you bulls, their [stock price plummeted by 66%](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/stock-price-history) and didn't recover for 3 years.  &amp;#x200B;  # SHORT $BA  &amp;#x200B;  *Disclaimer: This isn't actual investment advice. I seriously don't know wtf I'm doing. I'm just bearish on this stock and looking for ways to confirm my bias.* "|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|515274|public|confidence|self|||$BA issues 737 MAX software enhancement press release - offers condolences to families of both crashes.

At the time of the filing their assets were stated at [$71.4B with liabilities of $51.7B.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/pge-owner-of-biggest-us-power-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html) If you look at [their 8K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001004980/3dfd0af8-efac-45c8-8144-9269b0bf77be.pdf) filing they state debt defaults of approximately $21B. In addition they have at [minimum $44B](https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge/Home-ClaimInfo) in claims for their chapter 11. Prime clerk claims have been stated on sites like twitter as exceeding $100B, but this most likely double counts claims filed against multiple entities.

Contrary to what activist investors such as Blue Mountain have suggested PCG seems to be insolvent. This should be unsurprising as utilities are capital intensive with no room to generate excess returns.  Their [free cash flows have been negative](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/pcg/financials/cash-flow) for the past 4 of 5 years. They seem to have coasted on borrowing which is necessitated by their capex (regularly over $5 billion annually). They have limited room for new liabilities; [their cash ratio](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/pcg/financials?query=ratios) is less than 10%, even dropping down to 2% a couple years ago. PCG hasn't paid a dividend since Sept. 2017 and will be in bankruptcy proceedings for at least 2 years at current projections.  Future capex are expected to increase given their [criminal probation from a 2010 gas explosion overseen by Judge Alsup, and their responsibility for 17 wildfires in 2017](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/01/09/pge-feds-allege-utility-violated-terms-of-its-criminal-probation-in-the-san-bruno-explosion-judge-sets-hearing/), and [most likely responsible for the 2018 Camp Fire.](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Hook-on-PGE-Tower-Eyed-as-Cause-of-Deadly-Camp-Fire-502035081.html) PGE's own estimate are $30B in wildfire liabilities before punitive damages.

Alsup is expected to rule by the end of the month on their proposed plan with [Jun 21st as a rough line in the sand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-30/pg-e-judge-sees-clear-cut-pattern-of-utility-starting-fires) signaling the start of next fire season. It should be noted CPUC which oversees PGE opposes the current proposed outages and must approve any rate hikes including those from SB 901. PCG has [5x the rate of wildfires](https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/fires/article221924560.html) of the next two largest utilities in California.   Any valuation which sees surviving equity requires haircuts for creditors and wildfire victims. PCG themselves have been amicable to including wildfire victims in bankruptcy proceedings since their first hearing (Jan 31) as have the government:  &gt;‚ÄúWe think, your honor, that the dynamics of Chapter 11 will facilitate negotiations among claimants and for a global resolution of aggregate wildfire liabilities. Discussions with claimants lawyers, the subrogation claimants, attorneys representing the communities, have already commenced. We‚Äôd recommend bringing the CPUC and other state parties into talks as well.  &gt;The plan would be to establish a trust into which all the wildfire claims would be funneled and resolved.‚Äù   **Who Can Save Them?** -  Recent news has made much of the recent [State of the State by Gov. Newsom:](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/01/14/governor-newsom-statement-on-pge-announcing-intention-to-file-bankruptcy/)  &gt;""They will work with my strike team to develop a comprehensive strategy that we will present within 60 days. We will ensure continued access to safe affordable power. We will seek justice for fire victims, fairness for employees, and protection for ratepayers. We will continue to invest in safety, and we will never waver on achieving the nation‚Äôs most ambitious clean energy goals.""  It's clear both from the state government and PGE there is no plan to just grimfuck the wildfire victims. Citi's analysis, and many buy recommendations hinge on changing the state's inverse condemnation laws. Importantly inverse condemnation is [part of the California constitution.](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&amp;sectionNum=SEC.%2019.&amp;article=I) To change the constitution [requires 2/3s (supermajority) of both chambers *and* must go to a vote on the ballot.](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Constitution) The [courts have already ruled inverse condemnation applies to utilities, they won't just change it to save PGE](http://www.counties.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/csac_issue_brief_inverse_condemnation_7-25-18.pdf)  As such no bill can simply change inverse condemnation, which is probably why it wasn't addressed with [SB 901](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB901) when it looked like PCG might go bankrupt. In fact the legislature specifically excluded 2018 in affording rate protections, allowing compensation through bonds backed by rate hikes for 2017 and 2019. In order to take advantage of rate funded compensation for wildfire liabilities PCG *must first incur the debt* which they cannot afford.  Of the past 5 years (2018 excluded) PCG has only seen positive free cash flows of a mere $336 million. Assuming the fire mitigation matched their [expenses for operation based on past net income](https://www.pge.com/pge_global/common/pdfs/about-pge/company-information/regulation/FERCForm2.pdf) they would need a ~40% rate hike to free $1 billion in net operating income which would still be a net negative free cash flow based on 2012-2017 cash flows, or ~80% across the board rate hike to see net operating income increase by $2 billion. This would be politically unpopular as the state would be bailing out PGE at the expense of the rate payers while already paying high rates with high annual rate increases. And this would be just so PGE could continue to borrow to fund their operations, now at a higher interest rate because they just defaulted on all their current debts.  **What Does History Tell US?** -  The largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies have historically wiped out common shareholders or seen their value reduced to less than $1 a share:  * General Motors * Lehman Brothers * Enron * [CIT Group](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cit-shares-at-4-cents-after-lender-emerges-from-bankruptcy-2009-12-10) * [Conseco](https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20030915/SUB/309150720/out-of-bankruptcy-conseco-remains-vulnerable) * [MF Global](https://www.wsj.com/articles/liquidation-of-mf-global-comes-to-an-end-1455050476) * Penn Central Transportation Company ([nationalized](https://case.edu/ech/articles/p/penn-central-transportation-co)) * [Refco](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-last-days-of-refco/) * [Ual Holdings](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/06/02/3-bankruptcies-that-actually-helped-investors.aspx) * [Delta](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/635192063/Delta-shares-to-become-worthless.html)  Only Texaco (not listed) emerged from bankruptcy with retained shareholder value and that case is quite unique. [PGE's original chapter 11 is not listed](http://investor.pgecorp.com/news-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2001/Pacific-Gas-And-Electric-Company-Files-For-Chapter-11-Reorganization/default.aspx), although some of the aforementioned companies were wiped out by their subsidiaries chapter 11. All of the above saw their share holders being wiped out, including those which were ultimately bailed out. Conventional wisdom is chapter 11 wipes out commons in 90%+ (if not 95%) of cases.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm currently short PCG with a significant portion already turned to a loss by the recent insanity over a stock with no tangible chance of being bailed out or saved in the courts. I would love it if someone could tell me with any refinement how it is they might avert wiping out all shareholder equity."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|503287|public|confidence|self|||Since Citi Can't Be Fucked to do DD - $PCG||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/asftme/since_citi_cant_be_fucked_to_do_dd_pcg/|house_only|1||||||||||1553218831.0||||2019-02-19|GM

IQ has been described as the Netflix of China more accurately it‚Äôs what YouTube hopes to be in 5 years if they‚Äôre lucky.   iQiyi is both user generated entertainment and produces their own content except on a much larger scale than YouTube currently, YouTube has 1.5 million premium subscribers to their Red programming which is absolutely laughable compared to iQiyis 80million+ (which I expect to be 100million). Even compared to Netflix that number is very high to Netflixs 120 million. Different from Netflix their cost per month converts to about $3 per month alongside ads similar to Hulu.   ##Numbers   As I‚Äôve mentioned they have 80 million+ subscribers I didn‚Äôt say that it was 40million last year.

The American Elite made a huge gamble on education and it didn't pay off. They deliberately dumbed down the American population. They wrongfully assumed companies like GM, Exxon Mobil, Ford would be the largest companies in the world *forever.* ""I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers"" - Rockefeller. That hubris cost America dearly. They trained the population to be good factory workers. Rote labor is all but automated these days. No one is working at a factory anymore but the population is still trained to work in a factory. The demand is for creative, innovative, and smart people. American's weren't trained to be creative, innovative or smart. There is a lack of talent as noted by every Silicon Valley CEO in their interviews about hiring. Watch those interviews they all say the same thing the demand is not being met within America and they need to look global. This works in their favor since these developing regions have cheap labor but it's more than that. It's not a coincidence most of the Tech CEO's are Indian, Chinese, or from South East Asia. Those regions didn't develop until the last 30 years or so they skipped the factory floor element of the workplace. The demand is for programmers, mathematicians, innovative thinkers and they trained their population accordingly. There are more people living in China with genius level IQ's than there are people living the US. US education hasn't caught up to workplace demand and they are falling behind in tech to developing countries.

I've already had a lot of good feedback - keep it coming.   # 1) Apple cuts Q1 outlook, citing China weakness and fewer upgrades (sent from my iPhone 6):  Ouch. A couple points about this:  * Wedbush's Dan Ives: ""It was the degree and how confined it was to China. The fact that China basically fell off a cliff was a jaw dropper, and combined with the lack of metrics, it makes investors feel like they‚Äôre walking blindfolded in the dark.‚Äù * Keep in mind there was an Apple protest because of Canada's arrest of Huawei CFO. * Trade tensions are also pretty core to the big drop. There are plenty of Chinese alternatives to Apple if the iPhone is bogged down in the trade dispute. * This could be the straw that breaks the Trump camel's back on trade. Apple's market cap was around $750 billion at the close yesterday, so the 9% pre-market decline chops off around $67.5 billion of market cap. And that's just one company - there have been a bunch of other suppliers that are tanking this morning too (see: AVGO, SWKS, LITE, to name a few) * Required reading: Bloomberg Opinion¬†[Apple‚Äôs iPhone Warning Comes Years Too Late](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-02/apple-s-iphone-warning-comes-years-too-late)  I would argue that this was all well signaled, all the way back to last quarter's earnings. There were plenty of signs - discounts on iPhone Xr, cautious comments by Tim Cook on China over the past few months, commentary around handset trends in China and Apple slipping. I'm actually surprised the market moved this much on this.  # 2) Apple's revised outlook is just a symptom of something a lot bigger:  And that's a broader China slowdown.     CNN¬†[Apple won't be the last casualty of China's slowdown](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/02/intl_business/apple-china-sales-economy/index.html)¬†which says the slowdown...  &gt;spells trouble for companies that rely on China's enormous market to boost their global sales. Chinese consumers could be less willing to part with their cash for the latest smartphone or luxury handbag as they tighten their belts.""Brands like Apple will struggle in part because consumers are having to think harder to justify premium products and brands,"" said Cavender. He points out that China now boasts a number of homegrown smartphone makers, like Huawei and Xiaomi. Many of these offer products that are competitive with the iPhone's capabilities but are substantially cheaper.  The article also mentions SBUX, GM, F, TSLA as other companies that might take an Apple-like hit from the slowing China market.  Evergreen point: US markets need China growth in order to get back up to recent highs.     # 3) Tesla just trying to sell a mass-market vehicle. For $44,000.  Wall Street Journal¬†[Tesla Shares Sink on Model 3 Delivery Miss, Price Cut](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-plans-to-trim-prices-as-fourth-quarter-deliveries-rise-11546437526?mod=e2tw)  &gt;The $2,000 across-the-board cut lowered the starting cost for the Model 3‚Äîthe vehicle Tesla is banking on to reach the mass market‚Äîto $44,000. Tesla said the move was to help make up for the phasing out of federal tax incentives for its vehicles, beginning this year.  Who woulda thunk?  # 4) Too much is being made of the Fed's balance sheet:  A lot of the chatter around the Fed has been about its balance sheet. By letting securities lapse, it amounts to de facto tightening, possibly around 25 bps equivalent.     But, it doesn't really matter! Everybody knows that this is happening, and the expectations haven't changed. Powell said last month that there are not changes planned around balance sheet policy. It just seems like something that people are using as an excuse for market weakness.     For more, here was an A+¬†[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-12-31/balance-sheet-normalization-and-trade-are-biggest-2019-risks-says-invesco-s-hooper-video) segment on balance sheet normalization.     # 5) All you need to know about the shutdown in one headline  CNN¬†[Source: Trump tells Schumer he can't accept Dems' offer because he'd 'look foolish'](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/02/politics/donald-trump-shutdown-congress-meeting/)   "|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|457591|public|confidence|self|||5 Things I'm Watching Today (Thursday, January 3)||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ac53ww/5_things_im_watching_today_thursday_january_3/|house_only|1||||||||||||||2019-01-03|GM

Any feedback on how to make this better/more useful is always welcome.  1. **Growing tariff threat:** Trump threatened to follow through with 25% tariffs on Chinese goods, up from 10%, starting in January. Meeting between Trump and Xi might be the best (last?) chance to defuse tensions ([WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-xi-g-20-meeting-offers-best-chance-in-months-to-defuse-us-china-trade-fight/2018/11/26/fdbab40a-edc9-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.07dd3e016c0e)). This could all be expectation setting though (if it's something like ""look, it was going to be 25% but we kept it at 10%!"" Really nothing changed). What counts as a ""ceasefire"" isn't much. 2. **Fedspeak:** Lots of Fed action on the calendar this week. Clarida is the most important today (said he backs gradual hikes as the neutral rates remain uncertain, but also said TIPS shows inflation ""somewhat"" below 2% target). WSJ overnight said Fed will be data-dependent, which is as expected, but that inflation expectations might start to be more of a factor, especially if it keeps falling. And note, core is the most important metric - so strip out oil prices. Still the most important this week is Powell's speech in NY (Wednesday at 11:30 am ET). 3. **Rising rates as fewer foreign buyers purchasing Treasuries:** [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-foreign-graphic/foreign-buyers-find-u-s-treasuries-less-appealing-idUSKCN1NV27V)¬†talked about this overnight. Could be a big headwind if it pushes borrowing costs even higher. 4. **Dollar headwind on growing net-long positioning:** [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cftc-forex/speculators-raise-net-long-u-s-dollar-bets-in-latest-week-cftc-reuters-idUSKCN1NV2LV?il=0)¬†talked about this overnight. Could be a headwind to earnings growth next year, which is expected to fall into the single digits from 20%+ this year. Between rates and the dollar, there's less room for error in earnings season. 5. **Other headwinds to growth:** [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-closings-a-fresh-sign-of-worry-for-economy-1543271097?mod=hp_lead_pos3) said the GM closings are a ""fresh sign of worry"" of slowing domestic growth.¬†[WSJ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-27/capital-spending-slowdown-flashes-a-warning-for-2019-u-s-growth) also said the ""housing boom is coming to an end"" on higher rates and affordability concerns. That alone is nothing new, but it gives us a better idea of when and how big of a drag housing will be on GDP growth (it has already been a net negative for at least the past quarter, so look for that to only get worse).¬†[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-27/capital-spending-slowdown-flashes-a-warning-for-2019-u-s-growth) said capital spending is slowing, and might only get worse on trade concerns."|True|False|False|wallstreetbets|t5_2th52|431360|public|confidence|self|||5 Things I'm Watching Today (Tuesday, Nov 27th)||||https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/a0uy15/5_things_im_watching_today_tuesday_nov_27th/|house_only|1||||||||||||||2018-11-27|GM

However, sales increased by 30% YoY  ¬∑ Micron is going to be hiring over 1000 new employees by 2022 as they believe expansion is key and the demand for memory will support the expansion  ¬∑ Cash position declined sequentially, but that‚Äôs due to a reduction of convertible debt notes. $6.4bn worth of debt has been paid off.  ¬∑ Hired new President of worldwide sales- Mike Bokan  &amp;#x200B;  **The Future of Micron:**  Unfortunately, Micron‚Äôs guidance for Q1FY19 was much weaker than what I was expecting. Let‚Äôs look at what they predicted:  *Non-GAAP Guidance:*  Revenue: $7.9bn - $8.3bn  GM: 57% - 60%  Operating Expense: $750mm +/- $25mm  EPS (based on 1.2bn sharecount): $2.95 +/- $0.07  There are a couple of factors affecting guidance that I believe are actually blown out of proportion. First and foremost, Micron‚Äôs tax rate is expected to increase from 2% to 12.8%. This is drastic increase that was expected due to the next tax bill. On a proportional basis, I believe the tax rate alone will decrease EPS by about $0.34.  In addition to this, tariffs and CPU shortages became a big point of contention. It is hard to estimate an exact impact of tariffs, but I estimate this will reduce EPS by about $0.12 (even more if tariffs become 25% rather than 10%). Intel has three facilities making 14nm chips, and though Intel already spent $1bn on CAPEX, adding even more production takes time. This slow-down in production is a short-term loss for Micron as PC makers aren‚Äôt buying as many memory chips because of slowed production due to scarce CPU chips. Unfortunately, the weakened demand on Intel causing shortages is expected to last about 2 quarters.  &amp;#x200B;  **Supply/Demand Outlook:**  Micron expects DRAM to up about 22% YoY and NAND to be up as much as 45% YoY for the remainder of 2018. For 2019, Micron expects DRAM bits to grow another 20% YoY and for NAND to slow the growth to only 40% YoY.  Micron believes that DRAM profit GM will remain strong, if not increase, while NAND supply to moderate itself due to 96L challenges (Sanjay touched on this during the call. Approx. 37:00). Micron will also actively work to produce 3D X-Point.  SEMI‚Äôs World Fab Forecast data point to an improbable eye-watering fourth consecutive year of fab equipment spending growth to the tune of 5 percent.  [https://imgur.com/a/VsallVb](https://imgur.com/a/VsallVb)  When putting FAB spending on the same axis as aggregate revenue, we see that this carries an r2 value of 0.772, which is very strong.  [https://imgur.com/a/U9gFEeM](https://imgur.com/a/U9gFEeM)  So this shows us that an increase in FAB spending should lead to an increase in revenues, which should drive the stock prices higher even if the multiples aren‚Äôt changing.  On this note, Intel is expected to spend $5bn in Israel this year ([Intel Expansion](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12774/intel-discloses-plans-to-spend-5-billion-on-israeli-fab-28)).  Micron Technology is opening a new facility in Singapore this year ([Singapore Facility](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12622/micron-starts-construction-of-third-nand-fab)). Micron is also opening a new facility in Singapore. Overall FAB spending in expected to see a 5% CAGR spending starting this year.  Inkwood Research sees the semiconductor market growing at 7.67% CAGR through 2024, ending with an $835bn market by then. In 2017, the semi market was $499bn with $364bn in sales. Discounting these numbers at the same rate (73%), this gives us $607bn.  Obviously the market is discounting that growth by a fair bit, with concerns of cyclicality and a drop off in prices. The semiconductor cycle is boom and then bust. We've clearly had some boom, but have we had it all?  Going into 2018, a KPMG survey found the semi cycle to be mostly expansionary still.  [https://imgur.com/a/4l5t390](https://imgur.com/a/4l5t390)  Concerns of seasonality/cyclicality have started to really grow. After a huge runup in SOXX (semiconductor ETF) over the past few years, it's up 5% this year so far with long peaks and troughs, running up strong when the market is running good (December/January) and getting hit hard in overall pullbacks (February).  **Memory Outlook (As per BoAML):**  As I stated above, the entire semiconductor industry hasn‚Äôt reached its peak, and I don‚Äôt believe it will for at least 10 years. Recently, Merrill Lynch analyst Simon Woo visited South Korea (one of the biggest countries for memory) and had many positive things to say about the industry:  ¬∑ CAPEX remains conservative for wafer fabrication equipment and incremental spending is mostly absorbed by shell fab construction.  ¬∑ DRAM market is seeing low inventory levels for a few weeks. NAND inventories are behind by 4 weeks  ¬∑ ASP in 2019 should remain stable  ¬∑ NAND ASP in the rest of CY18 should be smaller than expected  ¬∑ Tariffs will have a minimal impact  ¬∑ DRAM demand is solid (30-40% bit growth)  [Merril Lynch Analysis](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/18/09/12383308/bank-of-america-updates-memory-outlook-after-south-kore)  **The Negatives:**  ¬∑ Their guidance is weaker than I would‚Äôve liked regardless of the reason.  ¬∑ Even if Intel CPU shortage is true and affecting Micron, this means poorer demand  ¬∑ If Micron is building inventory now, this probably will lead to oversupply in CY2019. This would likely drive prices lower.  ¬∑ Higher CAPEX weighs in on operating cash flow. In turn, this forces depreciation expenses to increase, which drives EPS lower.  ¬∑ NAND prices are falling   ¬∑ The already-below EPS estimate is with a 1.2bn sharecount, which is not taking into account the buyback. With $1.5bn in buybacks this quarter (assuming a share price of $45), we still have 1.166bn shares outstanding. Adjusted for GAAP diluted EPS, we are still NOT up to analyst estimates.  **The Positives:**  ¬∑ Management states that weak guidance is due to CPU shortages on behalf on Intel, tariffs, and higher taxes instead of being due to weak demand.  ¬∑ DRAM supply/demand outlook appears to be very healthy. Micron says that accelerating supply growth worries are overstated and that DRAM bit growth should be 20%.  [https://imgur.com/a/0Bo8x3k](https://imgur.com/a/0Bo8x3k)  ¬∑ Though NAND prices are falling, this accounted for only 13% of revenue and sales increased by 30%.  ¬∑ Network Business Unit is very strong. Revenues nearly doubled YoY. Nvidia chose Micron as a partner for GDDR6 graphics alongside Nvidia‚Äôs new TRX GPU  ¬∑ Mobile Business Unit revenues rose 60% and are expected to rise further going forward.  ¬∑ Micron is spending $10.5bn +/- 5% for CAPEX in 2019. Would a company who is expecting a decline in demand want to expand their business? No.  ¬∑ Though ASP may decline, production costs are declining as well and should offset the price.   ¬∑ Micron is going to actively buyback their stock up to $10bn.

Flat QoQ growth in bit shipments offset by 7% increase in QoQ ASP * GM grew to 60.9% up 250bps QoQ  **Memory Sustainability:**  *Rising Capital Intensity:* Moore‚Äôs law is slowing down and supply growth is becoming more expensive. Bits per wafer growth to continue to decelerate as transitions are also taking longer.  [https://imgur.com/a/FDBGJqf](https://imgur.com/a/FDBGJqf)  *Cost Declines are Structurally Declining:* DRAM cost declines have moderated from historic Moore‚Äôs law cadence of 30% per year to 10%-15%.   [https://imgur.com/a/xfyBPri](https://imgur.com/a/xfyBPri)  *Node Transitions Adding Fewer Bits:* Supply growth from node transitions is now below demand for both DRAM and NAND. Capacity additions will be needed going forward in order to meet demand requirements.  [https://imgur.com/a/CMlm5L4](https://imgur.com/a/CMlm5L4)  *DRAM and NAND Supply Models:* NAND y/y bit growth peaks in late C3Q/C4Q with 64-layers cross over, the move to 96-layers is likely to be difficult and even at equivalent yields produce fewer incremental bits per wafer. While DRAM y/y bit growth doesn‚Äôt peak until C2Q19, 1-y shrinks are only yielding \~8% bit growth/wafer, implying the need to increase wafers \~10%/annum to meet demand ‚Äì since CY13 wafer adds have only been \~1%/annum.  *Increasing Memory ROI:* To be clear, the structural growth in memory that I am arguing is NOT free of cyclical risk ‚Äì the fundamental mismatch between capacity additions and the demand curves for which the capacity is being added has and will always lead to periods of digestion. In addition, with the rising longer-term importance of memory, and the rising pricing over the last 12 months ‚Äì it is prudent to believe that end customers have bought ahead at least modestly. However, absolute CapEx levels, rising capital intensity and increasing memory content per unit of compute support softer landings, higher highs and higher lows. The risk to the memory cycle is macro demand, not bottom-up supply.  *Growing Importance of Memory:* With a slowing of (1) Moore‚Äôs Law, (2) Denard Scaling, (3) instruction level parallelism, and (4) the impact of Amdahl‚Äôs Law ‚Äì fundamental transistor utilization (memory bound), is becoming critical to incremental system-level performance improvements. New applications like AI, are significantly more memory intensive with logic/memory ratio moving from \~1-to\~1 in PCs/Handsets to x-to-x in a standard server and 11-1 in a deep learning sever.  **Strong Core End Market Growth:**  MU continues to expect exponential data growth with a projected rev of $150bn by 2018, up from $38bn during the PC/Internet 2000-2007. By 2021, the company could see 62 zettabytes (62k GB) of data up from vs. \~250GB created annually from 2000-2007. By core end market: Autos represents $5.9b (\~24% CAGR); Data Centers represents $62b (\~21% CAGR); IoT represents $16b (\~16% CAGR); andMobile represents $54b (5% CAGR) by CY21.  [https://imgur.com/a/qKrnFOm](https://imgur.com/a/qKrnFOm)  **Declining DRAM and NAND Pricing?**  DRAMexchange keeps reporting that ASP is declining. Applied Materials just reported earnings and they stated that this is not true. However, if this were true, it's expected. Production costs are declining faster than the ASP.  **TL;DR-** It's ridiculous how cheap this stock is getting. I've been buying since $57 and it's a joke at this point. Even if it drops further, I'm not going to risk the opportunity to own this company. 20% of their shares will be retired in addition to 50% of FCF going forward.

Going to do a nice little write up on $TTPH.  Pulled up the Biotech Calendar for FDA events and randomly scrolled for a second and stopped on this is one that I saw coming towards the end of the month, so it'll give you faggots some time to review and decide.  I have no idea if my DD will signal buy or sell, haven't looked at this company at all yet.  Just going to roll with it and type as I go.  I'm also the one trying to put together a site that will have the FDA calendar along with DD of upcoming events.  I'm retarded with websites though and work, so it wont be up for several weeks probably.  Hopefully I dont fuck up this format.  Note: I don't have a position in this, like I said, I just picked some random event coming up and started typing.  Hopefully I can make sense through my bourbon.      #*Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals*   # *Who Are They?*  Some biotech company that researches ways to get around potential antibiotic resistance. They create antibiotics to combat bacterial infections, including those caused by many of the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  This is shit like E. coli and Chlamydia which are resistant to some forms of current antibiotics because they mutate too efficiently (fuck you evolution).  So for all you degenerate hooker loving faggots out there, I guess its a relatable company.  They have been around for 12 years and their leadership team looks like a bunch of cucks, unlike Musk dady.  One of the fuckers is cross eyed, can't trust em.  So we have to divert to the science on this one.     # *Over View*  They focus on synthetic variations of the Tetracycline, generating over 3,000 unique derivatives and creating a pipeline of novel antibiotics.  Essentially they are a one trick pony.  They seem to do alright at it, but they have the idea that their antibiotics can be used in oncology, but they are hoping for a stretch that really won't likely pan out.  So they focus their efforts on fighting bacteria that are becoming resistant to shit.  These drug-resistant bacteria are immune to the antibiotics society has counted on to treat these infections, causing a global public health crisis and what some have referred to as a ‚Äúpost antibiotic era‚Äù.  Of most concern are patients with bacterial infections that are resistant to many/multiple classes of antibiotics; referred to as multidrug-resistant (MDR), pandrug-resistant (PDR), or extremely drug resistant (XDR) bacterial infections.   Bacteria can be broken into two categories, Gram-positive and -negative.  You don't need to know what the fuck that means, just know that the company focuses on Gram-Negative which has been pretty much neglected like a red headed step child.  Gram-Negative (GN I will start calling it) cause most of the current serious infections in hospitals which is roughly 30% of all hospital infections.  Mortality is pretty high due to these infections being resistant to shit, so people just keep dropping.     They license their tech from Harvard, so its gotta be working right?  Those Ivy League kids in Boston are smarter than those idiots at Yale in shit hole New Haven.  Anyways, Tetracycline has been around for 50 years and now this company is making it fully synthetically allowing it to be adjusted beyond anything that was done before and decrease the ability for bacteria to resist it.    They use Tetracycline as the core structure and just modify the shit out of it like a Puerto Rican's Honda.     # *Pipeline*    *Eravacycline*   Flagship product, treats life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) GN Bacteria.  A Fully synthetic tetracycline antibiotic in Phase III for treating intra-abdominal infections and some fucked up UTIs, comes with a side of cranberry juice.  Luckily for this company, the FDA thinks UTI's are serious business and granted these guys both Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for both indications of use.  Thats pretty sweet they have more than one indication for one drug.  Two birds, one stone.     *TP-271*   Used to combat respiratory disease caused by bacteria and pahtogens. The FDA has granted QIDP and Fast Track designations for TP-271 for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, another two birds one stone situation.  Phase I though, so they are testing to see if the shit is safe, we will see later on. They have no news on this shit for a while.    *TP-6076*   Some investigatory drug they are running through Phase I to fight E. coli and a few other bacteria.  Lead candidate to fight a few different of the most urgent GN bacteria threats according to the CDC.  This one seems like they just picked one of the full synthetic versions of Tetracycline they have that they think will be effective and threw it out there.  We wont focus on this fucker, itll probably get through Phase I and be deemed safe like the other drug.    # *The Real Focus - Eravacycline*    So this bitch is finishing up Phase III in two different studies, IGNITE1 and IGNITE4.  Eravacycline was investigated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) as part of the Company's IGNITE phase III program which comprised of administration to over 1,500 patients. In IGNITE1, a pivotal phase III trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV eravacycline met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to ertapenem, was well-tolerated and achieved high cure rates in patients with Gram-negative pathogens, including resistant isolates. The IGNITE1 data is serving as the basis of the Marketing Authorization Application  for IV eravacycline for the treatment of patients with cIAI now under review by the European Medicines Agency . In IGNITE4, a second phase 3 clinical trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV eravacycline met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to meropenem, was well-tolerated and achieved high cure rates. The Company has used the results from IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 to support a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA for IV eravacycline in cIAI. The NDA is currently under review with the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of August 28, 2018. In clinical trials to date, eravacycline has been administered to more than 2,700 patients. Eravacycline has not been approved for commercial use.   2,700 patients is quite a few in the clinical trial space.  Typically clinical trials through all phases will at most see around 3500 patients, so hitting a number near 3,000 and proving both safe and effective is pretty critical.  Not only that, bu the FDA seems to be wanting to pass more drugs through the pipeline of approval since Trump's inauguration so this only improves the chances or approval.  They are seeking approval in Europe, which would boos the revenues from the product, but what we really want to see is FDA approval because all the profits are really made in America.  However, that European MAA filing presents a massive stepping stone for the company on their first regulatory application for marketing authorization and pushing them one step closer to market.  Using both Phase III studies which are showing positive results will likely increase the chance of approval by FDA.   Even further, Tetraphase is also currently conducting IGNITE3, an additional phase III trial evaluating once-daily IV eravacycline in patients with cUTI and, assuming a positive outcome, the Company plans to use the results from IGNITE3 to support a supplemental NDA submission for eravacycline in cUTI. In parallel, Tetraphase is continuing its efforts to develop an oral dose formulation of eravacycline. A phase 1 clinical program is ongoing which is designed to evaluate and optimize the oral dosing regimen for eravacycline.  The phase III IGNITE3 results show that the clinical trial enrolled 1,205 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive IV eravacycline (1.5mg/kg every 24 hours) or ertapenem (1g every 24 hours) for a minimum of 5 days, and then were eligible for transition to an appropriate approved oral agent. The co-primary endpoints of responder rate (a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success) in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population at the end of IV visit and at the test of cure visit (Day 5-10 post therapy) were evaluated using a 10% non-inferiority margin. Responder rates in the micro-ITT population at the end of IV visit were 84.8% and 94.8% for eravacycline (n=363/428) and ertapenem (n=382/403), respectively (-10% CI: -14.1%, -6.0%).  Responder rates at the test of cure visit were 68.5% and 74.9% for eravacycline (n=293/428) and ertapenem (n=302/403), respectively (-6.5% CI: -12.6%, -0.3%).  Some good fuckin results, showing the shit is effective.  Top line reached baby.   There are probably several of you retards reading going, ""What the fuck is a PDUFA?""  Well its called the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, essentially companies pay money to the FDA towards this shit and it goes into speeding up Drug Approval times.  The PDUFA Dates are deadlines for the FDA to review new drugs and they normally have about 10 months to review them.  If a drug is selected for priority review, FDA has 6 months.  This all starts once the NDA is accepted by the FDA.  This company filed their NDA back on January 2nd, and the FDA accepted the filing on February 27th.  So the FDA has a deadline of August 28th to give their response on the NDA filing, which was given priority review as well as Fast Track designation and some other shit.    The Phase III data was positive, the primary endpoint was met.  Thats some good fuckin news.  However they are filing for two indications here.  Thats what the fuck is worrying me.  I have seen this before, they are throwing a handful of tacks at a board and hoping one sticks, kind of.  In both indications that they completed studies on, these homies find that the drug is not only effective at what it does, but it also is relatively safe.  Compared to other drugs that are already approved, their compound is found to be no less effective, giving this shit a good case.     Second Quarter 2018 should bring Eravacycline (apparently its also called Xerava) to market on a global level, like I said Eurotrash countries and Murrica.  They are getting ready for commercial launch upon approval.  They are also working on developing plans in China having recently also submitted an IND to the Chinese FDA.  I bet China and Asia gets fucked hard by GM Bacteria just due to population and lack of excellent healthcare.  So thats a huge market for them if they get approved in Asia.  Anyways, yeah to sum up they will likely see FDA approval in the next month and Commercial launch in Q4 2018.   *FINANCIAL SHIT*  Now these dont really fucking matter for Biotech companies because most of them hemorrhage cash until they get bought out.  But here we go, a layout of their financial situation as of June 30th, 2018.  Cash and Cash Equivalents - $111.2 million  Shares Outstanding - 52.9 million  They expect their cash to last them through Q3 2019, so they wont be looking to raise any capital ASAP.  This is some good fuckin news for people playing the approval.  Unlikely to see a fuckin offering a day after or day of FDA approval if it does happen.  So you will likely see some of the gains hold for months following.    Q2 reveneues were $11.6 million, compared to $1.6 million last year Q2, a real 10 bagger.   The boys did it.  Although, nearly all of it came from licensing to China which is dope because this shows they can license shit out while also get grant revenue from governments and also should see some revenues flow in following commercialization if the drug is approved Q3-Q4.  R&amp;D expenses are down 50% YoY, mainly due to completion of studies.  However, their expenses on administration are going up a few million YoY.  This is due though to the expectation of commercialization and the company preparing to rake in some cash money.  The company reported last week that they had a net loss of $9.5 million (-$0.18 per share), compared to a net loss of $31.8 million (-$0.83 per share) reported same time in 2017.  They arent losing as much money and are showing good data.  This is tight.   *THE MARKET*  Now you are thinking, how big is this fucking GN bacteria market?  Can some fuckin germs be worth that much?  Well, according to the CDC, antibiotic-resistant infections cause over 23,000 deaths per year.  Fuck, over 2 million people become infected with these tricky fuckers that resist drugs and a bunch more people die due to complications caused by the bacteria resistant to antibiotics.    This market of antibiotic-resistant bacteria treatments was valued at $26 billion and is expected to reach $44 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 6%.  Thats a good sized market.    #*TLDR*  They make some drugs to fight bacteria which are antibiotic-resistant.  They have 3 drugs in pipeline, but only one we care about now.  They have just over 2 weeks until they get a PDUFA notice from FDA on a NDA filing, hoping to get approval in the US for marketing their drug.  They are seeking Asia, more specifically Chinese, approval and European approval as well in coming months.  They have two different Phase III studies that show efficacy as well as safety in over 2500 patients.  They show that compared to similar compounds, the drug Eravacycline is just as effective as well as maintaining a safe profile.  Shit is going for two different indications which is pretty cool, shows diversity but the FDA can be fickle so it might be possible that only one indication is approved, they change some wording on their studies and label, and I see them getting both indications approved.  The market for their drug is pretty fucking big, going to grow over $40 billion in a few years, and if you follow science at all you know that antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem that needs to be addressed.  Their financials are pretty tight, they have cash to hold them off until end of Q3 2019.  This is the biggest thing to me because the company wont fuck their entire investor base by completing a fucking offering and announcing a dilution to everyone the day of approval.  Their leadership looked dumb in their pictures, they seem smart though because some Harvard connection.  Didnt read about them after seeing a cross eyed fuck.  Their trials have met all endpoints and the company is prepping for commercialization which is reflected in their finances.  This is a good sign and it means they expect approval.  I do too.  My take - They receive approval for at least one indication by August 24th, although I wouldnt be surprised by both indications being approved.  Company looks solid, they have plenty of cash, are ready for marketing their compound, and are reducing debt and spending.  No reason for denial from the FDA in my eyes, no reason for dilution immediately, and their drug was designated Fast Tracked and Qualified Infectious Disease Product, meaning that the FDA thinks that this is an urgent matter and needs to be addressed.  They are likely to approve compounds that receive these designations because if it is safe and can save lives, they will try to pass it, especially under the current environment.  Stock seems to have solid consolidation around $3.00 long term, I would expect this shit to hit $7.00 by September honestly.  I like it.  I approve.  I might buy.   #*Way Too Long Didnt Read*  It looks like a buy.    #*EDIT*  There are comments around the massive drop in 2015.  They have been in Phase III for a while, as this phase does take some time.  But these guys ran 4 different IGNITE studies on their flagship product, and IGNITE2 failed to meet endpoints back in 2015 as an IV to oral transition therapy for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, and failed to prove that it was not inferior to existing products. While it caused concern then, they have initiated and seen success in more IGNITE studies, such as 1 and 3.  These have solid data, meet all endpoints, are safe and effective.  So while they couldnt get a hold of one indication before, it looks like they will for these two indications based off the successful studies.  I think that FDA approval is immanent due to the unmet market need that the company fulfills.  IGNITE2 might have failed, but the other indications are what we are seeking for FDA approval.  Also there are a ton of lawsuits going on apparently, if you check yahoo finance the page is littered with them.  Most of them are just reminders.  In my eyes, they are trying to cause alarm and scare off investors more than anything.  They are holding the basis that the company engaged in more patients in one of its studies to inflate the endpoint data in their favor to prove significant results while also lying about present data.  I doubt that is likely to be proven, so these lawsuits are insignificant.

Second, if I wanted to sell stock and buy options (neutral change in exposure) the risk profile of this exposure would change obviously. I would have recognized capital gains on a ST basis and would need cash from somewhere to pay it down the line, and if the options blow up then I compound my losses from selling early.  Now, If I did not have shares of BXC.. I would be buying options today.  Second  BXC is a very small company and it's thinly traded. Volatility will naturally be magnified due to these constraints. It's possible with any options contract that you can be right at the wrong time and lose money because of timing alone.  Now, BXC is about to report on a consolidated basis vs. YAG.. it will be a huge increase in EPS. I'm not exactly sure how much, have not done the math on a quarterly basis, but I suspect that ballpark it will be approximate $2.00.. which will be significantly higher than last years $0.35. This will be due primarily to the acquisition of Cedar Creek.. along with some debt pay down and capital structure improvements.  What most people don't understand is that BXC hasn't reported yet on a consolidated basis. When it does, the performance will now show up in the financial data. This will draw attention from the finance industry.. they'll take that quarterly number, multiply it by 4 and go HOLY SHIT this stock is CHEAP. That's my theory.. could be totally wrong but I doubt that.  You could very well make a shit ton on your options.. now that I think about it.. I may buy some tomorrow.  Third  I wouldn't take too much stock in one individuals options exercise. Yes this can be a sign of things to come, but that's not absolutely true. Options compensation is bound by time, and CFO Susan O'Farrell could have had to exercise, that's hard to find out for sure. There are still a lot of options on the table for execs, as well as a significant amount of insider buying around 30-35/sh. I'm not too concerned on this point.  Other misc. points  $50MM in cost savings is a 2020 target. They've projected to do this without cutting staff. BXC has been improving their Gross Margin by 50bps annually. If this trend continues, this improvement will cover 20% of the synergy goal. Most people don't know that CC is actually a superior business to BXC with a GM% 80bps better than BXC. I suspect that BXC will gain a lot of institutional knowledge from their acquisition and the execs that stayed (they all stayed) along for the ride. This is all good for the Synergy target.. and the business in general.  This also actually gives BXC levers to pull if they start to fall short of their synergy goal.. they can cut staff if needed. It's in their back pocket, we will call it a margin of safety.  On the housing crisis stuff 2007-08 was a black swan event, real estate cycles are typically contained to geographic pockets, and are more sensitive to local catalysts vs. macro events. I do not foresee something like that happening in the near future, and if it was coming by definition we'd be hearing about it. Black swans don't happen twice.  bottom line  I'm very optimistic about Thursday, you should be too. I think the financial statements will reveal to the broader market what has happened here, and that information will be quickly incorporated into the stock price.
